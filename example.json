When I got the computer, a macbook pro 2022, I called AppleCare, and they told me I COULD NOT GET APPLECARE. WHY? Because the ORIGINAL owner purchased it on Oct. 6th, 2022. I purchased it on Dec. 24th, 2022. The AppleCare person stated that it was outside of the 60 day window to get AppleCare....And, he directed me to the Apple.com refurbished site for a better purchase. The WORM!",

		"review": "Apple has taken a sharp downward spiral, their products used to be top notch, but now they fail at almost every task. Word processing tasks are abysmal, photo editing is slow at best, and multitasking is out of the question. MacBook Pro’s are now a chrome book with a fancy screen resolution. They are all fluff and no substance, which is sad when they used to be excellent for most editing and word processing jobs. As a photojournalist I expect to be able to batch edit multiple images and continue writing captions or a news article at the same time. No longer with Apple’s latest MacBook Pro. This piece of junk makes a better paper weight than it does a laptop. Don’t waste your time or money, these new products from Apple leave much to be desired. Not to mention the frustration from waiting for the text that you typed to show up on the screen ten seconds later. I am transitioning away from an all Apple setup which I have built over the past 10 years. Not by choice I must add! I am really disappointed in the quality of this computer. But the webcam worked well. LOL!",

Apple clearly is focused on form over function.Unlike the earlier system, this system only has two ports for peripheral devices and charging.So, if you'd like to attach a power cord, a time machine drive, and anything else, you need to purchase a USB-C docking station.What a pain!Since previous generations of Time Machine devices used USB-A connectors and this machine doesn't have one, setting up the machine is much, much more painful than necessary.One has to purchase and received a dongle to attach a USB-A device.Furthermore, all of the dongles I've purchased over the years to attach devices need to be purchased again because they support lightening, USB-A or Micro USB rather than USB C.The transport company didn't communicate with me about the delivery and expected me to sit at home for 12 hours waiting for the driver to arrive so that I could accept the box and sign for it.UPS does not provide usable tracking information for the day of delivery.All-in-all, I like the machine, but I/O limitations are a constant irritation.",

This MAC is a beast compared to the previous PC’s I’ve owned. Everything is much better. Battery Life, processor’s, compatibility with all my wireless peripherals. It’s almost too much. Plenty of room to grow. MacBook Pro 13in. M2 16gbRAM 1 TB SSD!…I GOT PLANS!",

		"review": "Super fast boot time on this MacBook Pro, with great extra storage (1 TB internal drive) with extra RAM (16G), this year’s model 2022 with M2 chip. I couldn’t seem to find these options on the Apple store’s own site, which I wanted to buy from, but if they won’t offer it, I’m glad at least Amazon does.A word to buyers about the newer MacBooks running OS Monterey: there appears to be consistent problems with lines showing up on the screen, either horizontal or vertical, when the system is switching between apps and windows. I had this problem with a late 2016 model and now I see a faint trace of this same problem with this BRAND NEW 2020 model. Bummer. It appears to be a common problem, if you do a Google search. What are ya doing, Apple?I’m still happy with purchase. Looking forward to an update that will fix the screen line issue though.",

		"review": "Full disclosure: This is not my daily device. IT purchased one of these at work because they couldn't wait on the M2 MacBook Air, but now they wish they had.I have been using this device for a few weeks now and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. I have been a huge fan of Apple Silicon architecture since its release, and I originally purchased the 13\" MBP with the M1 chip in it before upgrading to the 16\" M1 Max that I use now. Apple Silicon is a game changer and really sets the standard for creative workloads.My issue at this point is what exactly this M2 version of the 13\" MBP brings to the table. The 2022 MacBook Pro with the M2 chip utilizes the older chassis from the previous gen. As such, your port options are limited and you do not get MagSafe charging. The chassis also is starting to look a bit dated with Apple shifting towards cleaner and flatter lines on their devices.The 2022 MacBook Air has everything you need in a device around this price point. With the 2022 MacBook Air, you will get MagSafe charging, you will get a larger 13.6\" screen with smaller bevels (vs. 13.3\" on MBP), you will get 1080p camera (720p on MBP), you will get lighter weight at 2.7lbs (3lbs on MBP), and you will get Apple's newer chassis.The MBP does include a fan for active cooling, as well as the touchbar. If you're purchasing the Apple MacBook Pro 13\" for tasks that require active cooling as a necessity, you will likely need a minimum of 16gb of RAM, at which point your best bet is to spend the extra $200 and upgrade to the 14\" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip. I have never met anyone who just really likes the touch bar to the point that it's a game changer, but if you really need that touch bar, this is the only way you can get it now.The M2 MacBook Pro also provides 2hrs of better battery life than the MacBook Air, but this is not worth sacrificing all of the other benefits of the Air.Overall, if you purchase this device, it will perform well and do everything you really need. It is a good computer and you will be happy with it. At the same time, there are BETTER purchase options on either end of the spectrum, creating sort of a niche market of consumers for which the 13\" MBP is desired. My recommendation is to either purchase the 2022 MacBook Air, or go ahead and step up to the 14\" MacBook Pro M1.",

		"review": "I settled on the MacBook Pro M2 over the MacBook Air M2 due to the active cooling fan and the Touch Bar.The fan only runs if needed during intensive cpu usage.The Air will slow the processor down to reduce the heat.I wanted to keep performance at peak, so the fan wins.The Touch Bar is something that I always wanted and it exceeds my expectations.I've used it more often than I thought I would.The lighted keyboard is very handy in late night, low light conditions where I don't want to have an overhead light on.I opted for the 512GB upgrade to have the space for the tasks I plan to do.I have the 8GB version and keep running the memory usage into the yellow.The measurement is taken from the Active Monitor app that comes with the Mac.If it goes into the red, then the system will slow down.I haven't hit the red wall yet, but it concerns me.I have 8GB on my 27\" iMac 2020 and never push it into the yellow.I can only conclude that the M2 is more memory hungry.I haven't done any in-depth tests, so take that comment at face value only.I was sitting next to my iMac and was able to move my MacBook trackpad and move across to the iMac and control my iMac from the MacBook.That's pretty cool.I can also use the mouse/keyboad on the iMac and move the cursor to the MacBook.Apple has come a long way with integration.I downloaded a IOS game app on the MacBook and ran it with no issues.Since there is no touchscreen, the trackpad simulates the touch.It takes a while to get use to it.I have no real need to continue using this particular app on the MacBook, but it was fun to see it work.There were some apps I downloaded that invoked the Rosetta Stone process to optimize the code to run on the M2.I suppose it would do the same on the M1 chip too.This only occurred when I performed the first launch.After that, every time I launch the app, it is quick.All in all, it is a very nice laptop and my first Apple laptop.It's only been three days of ownership and I can say it is the best laptop I've used.I look forward to many years of usage if Apple doesn't make it obsolete too quickly.Bottom line, if you think you'll be a power user, I would opt for the 16GB option.But, since these laptops cannot be upgraded once ordered, you can opt for the 24GB if your budget will handle it.",

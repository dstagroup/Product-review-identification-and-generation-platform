Instead it was a very wide cut that felt boxy. No tapering at the bottom. Had short torso and short V neck but the sleeves were super long. Thought about sizing up but decided not to because of the wide, unflattering cut overall. Too bad because material was nice. Overall just a crappy cut.

Feminine design. The sheer sleeves and Swiss dots are very stylish. I wear it tucked in the front and it‚Äôs super cute. Love the material and fits as expected. Not stretchy material, so I bought it slightly larger so it would be loose enough.","rating":5},{"title":"Perfect, comfy and professional","review":"This was perfect for my speaking event. It was the 4th blouse I'd purchased for this event. I ironed while covered with a tea towel. Easy to get slight wrinkles out after packaging. Not too hot.

I tried hand-washing the blouse and also tried using a spray-on wrinkle release product, but nothing worked. Finally had to drag out the ironing board, and using a hot steam iron they finally came out. On the plus side, the sleeves do not wrinkle at all. The sizing was also perfect.I am a busty woman, size 20 women's.I got the XXL in a navy blue, and it looks and fits great.If you're a small woman, I would think you would want to size down one size from normal.It's a very versatile blouse, goes great with jeans, skirt, or dress pants. Now that I have the wrinkles out, it appears that it will stay that way with normal hand washing care.","rating":4},{"title":"Adorable","review":"Super cute blouse. Fits as expected. Well made.Love the sleeves.I get many compliments when wearing.","rating":5},{"title":"Needed some adjustment","review":"I really love the top. The only problem is it drops lower in the front than I care for. I had to take it up in the shoulders so I wouldn't have patients seeing my bra and boobs all day. I would've gone with a Medium but that would've been too tight across the bust. After the adjustment, it was much more appropriate for work.","rating":4},{"title":"Super cute and great quality","review":"This runs a little big. I kept the small, and it is still very blousy. I have white and you cannot see through it at all because there is a liner.Very cute.","rating":5},{"title":"Great fit and look","review":"Great fit and looks great on.","rating":5},{"title":"Need Another!","review":"Loved this more than expected! Perfect for work or a nice afternoon out. Need another in a different color now!","rating":5},{"title":"Very pretty!","review":"I get compliments each time I wear this blouse. Appropriate for work, nice dinners, would even look cute with nice jeans and boots. The shoulders and sleeves are roomy and comfortable.

Great for having lunch with the girls or a date night out!","rating":5},{"title":"Nice quality, see through in back","review":"The shirt is good quality. The front has an extra layer to prevent your bra from showing, but the back does not so a nude camisole may be needed depending on your preference. The white was so cute that I bought another one in navy. Medium fits as expected.","rating":5},{"title":"Beautifu","review":"Great blouse. Great fit and feel.

Perfect for business casual","rating":5},{"title":"Cute, but low cut","review":"I love this top! It's very comfortable. I haven't washed it yet, so I can't comment on that. The only thing that would have taken away 1/2 star if possible, is that it's pretty low cut. I'll definitely need to wear a camisole under it to hide the cleavage when wearing to work. I will consider buying from this seller again.","rating":5},{"title":"I love it. Fit as expected.","review":"I love it the shirt.

I originally purchased a rust-colored shirt in size Large. It was very form-fitting - a little more fitted, but not so tight I can‚Äôt wear it. Pros:Love the fabric. It‚Äôs soft, but not transparent.It‚Äôs washer/dryer safe, but I dry it on a clothesline.","rating":5},{"title":"Cute top!","review":"Fits well and super cute!","rating":5},{"title":"Super cute","review":"I‚Äôm alwayshesitant to buy clothing from Amazon, but this top is super cute!

I‚Äôm usually an XL, so I ordered a L. I should have stayed with my usual size. I have to return for an Xl, but bummed that it‚Äôs now out of stock in the color I wanted for Christmas.

Really cute shirt","rating":5},{"title":"Fits and feels as expected!","review":"The blouse is exactly as I expected. I bought the mustard yellow one. Good material, not see through, runs a bit on the slim side so size up if you want a little wiggle room, since the material doesn‚Äôt stretch. The sleeves are my favorite part. I will definitely line dry it when I wash it. I would recommend it!","rating":5},{"title":"Lovely color","review":"Lovely color.

Heather Kellogg,5," November 27, 2022", Pink   ,128GB,I love how little it is and it is like the 4 which was a durable phone
Kia,4," November 11, 2022", Pink   ,128GB,"It arrived a day early, had no scratches and it came with a new screen protector already on it, charger cord and the charging box."
MRS. TURNER,5," November 10, 2022", Midnight   ,128GB,I order a iPhone from another seller and it was a lemonüçã. So happy I purchased this 13 mini! It works perfectly and I even got it $100 bucks cheaper than the other phone. Very satisfied and officially team iPhone!
mt linda,5," September 17, 2022", Starlight   ,128GB,"Replaces my se 5 which I also loved many years. I am so happy with this  Mini 13. The facial recognition is amazing and I do not miss the home button. In the time I‚Äôve had the renewed mini 13 the performance and battery life has been great, like new in fact. Only one or two events where screen hung up however, I‚Äôm attributing that to internet connectivity which can occur in my location. The cosmetics were like new, I did notice a very micro minute scratch on screen which is so unnoticeable that I almost didn‚Äôt want to even mention here, hardly a defect. Overall if you‚Äôre thinking of upgrading with this seller, I would say go for it, jump in and enjoy!"
Clifton,4," October 14, 2022", Midnight   ,128GB,"Used/refurbished iPhone 13 mini with very few scratches, only on the back. I'm satisfied."
Andrew Thomas,5," July 11, 2022", Midnight   ,128GB,"I was a bit weary buying a phone from a seller I haven‚Äôt bought from before, that‚Äôs a lot of trust when spending $600. I‚Äôve waited a few weeks to write this review to make sure all was well. The phone came in great condition with no scratches, nicks or dents.  Battery condition said it was still at 100% so that was really nice. All and all very satisfied with the seller.Now to the review of the phone itself.This is a fantastic phone in every way. I‚Äôve bought budget phones for 10 years now because I couldn‚Äôt afford the best money could buy. The last iPhone I had was the iPhone 5. This happened to be within my budget and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the phone itself. I was coming from a pixel 4a so a slight down Size from a 5.7 in screen to a 5.4 wasn‚Äôt an issue at all. I truly enjoy a smaller phone as I have small hands and find large heavy phones annoying. To have basically a flagship phone but in smaller packaging has been great. Battery life is actually a lot better than expected and Lasts all day with moderate to heavy use. If your hesitant to get this phone, don‚Äôt be! I will update the review if anything changes but so far I‚Äôm absolutely in love with my new phone."
Keith van buskirk,4," June 4, 2022", Blue   ,128GB,Shipping was very fast I received the product much sooner than anticipated which was a good thing. However I think I would‚Äôve been better off buying a new iPhone mini 13 this one didn‚Äôt even come with the original packaging it was just bubble wrapped with a charger and cable thrown in for looks.  The charging block and cable quickly failed after only a couple of uses and I had to go buy a new charging cable and a new charging block the phone is charging fine now.  I actually had to reset the phone to factory settings before I used it?!? I would definitely recommend spending the extra money on something that‚Äôs either new or renewed I wouldn‚Äôt buy a $650 iPhone from this vendor again.
Gabriela Cede√±o,4," September 12, 2022", Starlight   ,128GB,"No vino cargador como dec√≠a que ven√≠a, lo dem√°s todo bien"
James Hinostroza huayre,4," September 18, 2022", Midnight   ,256GB,La bater√≠a no est√° bueno
Mari & Fam,4," May 5, 2022", Starlight   ,128GB,Only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it didn‚Äôt come with the actual iPhone box it just came in a zip lock bag and did not come with the proper charger it states it would come with and for almost paying retail price I would of really liked to have the box and the actual charger it supposed to come with which is the usb c to lighting cable but yeah apple is skimming  us by not giving us headphones or a charging brick now days they say it‚Äôs for the environment but that‚Äôs bs only saves them money while the consumer pays extra  will update my review if I have to as I continue using the phone
Chris Hanson,4," August 18, 2022", Midnight   ,128GB,Just know if you buy plug for the wall that this phone comes with the old style cord not the new
Joshua,5," August 12, 2022", Midnight   ,128GB,"Bought this phone In Acceptable condition and hoped for the best and i could not be more satisfied. The phone came with zero scratches, dents or cracks and on top of that i got a free screen protector. Apart from the unoriginal apple box and the minor fact that someone else owned this device, i dont see why anyone would buy a brand new phone for 200 dollars more. The only downside to this purchase was the fact they gave me an iphone 12 mini screen protector instead of the 13 mini one but who cares. Totally Worth My Money!"
Byung Uk Kim,5," October 16, 2022", Blue   ,128GB,Thanks Loreta
Paul Chabot,4," July 8, 2022", Blue   ,128GB,"Can‚Äôt really rate much yet, as we just received this product a week ago. But of all the refurbished phones we‚Äôve bought through Amazon this is the only that‚Äôs ever come with scratches on the screen. A little disappointed in that."
gtrayler,5," August 29, 2022", Blue   ,256GB,"The phone arrived on time and was like a new one.  No scratches, no problems.  I took the sim from my old phone and put it in the new one and followed along with what popped up.  It worked perfectly.  So I purchased another one for me. This one was for my wife"
krysta g.,5," October 3, 2022", Starlight   ,128GB,Unlocked phone works good came with a screen protector.
Elle,5," March 26, 2022", Blue   ,128GB,"I‚Äôve always purchased my phones new so I was a little leary about ordering a preowned phone, but I am so happy I did! I ordered through the seller HQTRONIC LLC on 3/21 and received it on 3/24 which was way earlier than the expected delivery date of 3/29-4/4.  Upon opening the shipping box, the phone was wrapped in a foam sleeve and there was a new charging cord and plug included.  There was not a single scratch or any knicks on the phone‚Ä¶it looks new!  I was a little concerned as the battery was at 2%, but I charged it up and battery health shows 100%!  I upgraded to this from a 5 year old iPhone 7 which was having issues with the battery and I had to keep it on a charging cord most of the day and I‚Äôm so happy that I decided to upgrade.  I‚Äôm a very happy customer and the savings on this certified renewed iPhone will practically pay for a full year of my Mint Mobile service!  Thank you HQTRONIC LLC and Amazon!"
Brayden,4," June 26, 2022", Blue   ,128GB,"It was everything I was hoping for and more, everything is working like I‚Äôd hoped and the battery is at 100% health. My only issue is with a small delay on the buttons but it‚Äôs barely noticeable unless I‚Äôm really focusing on it. 10/10 must buy"
CJ Hays,5," August 21, 2022",Pink   ,128GB,Works great! Good solid phone with excellent battery life does what it should no problems. The mini  Size is nice because I can easily control what I‚Äôm doing with one hand and it fits in my pocket very nicely. Don‚Äôt care for the pink just got a good deal on it and with my Otter Box you can‚Äôt tell.
Impartial,5," September 13, 2022", Starlight   ,128GB,Upgraded from iPod touch - which I still have and use. Got this renewed item due to new not being available. Prefer smaller  Size that mini fulfills. Actually bigger than expected. Just right.
Jayden,5," September 25, 2022", Starlight   ,128GB,"Very surprised of the condition of the phone, battery life was at 100%, no scratches or smudges."
Ruth,5," October 7, 2022", Red   ,256GB,
Jessica M,5," September 11, 2022", Blue   ,128GB,I was hesitant on purchasing a refurbished phone as it was my first time. I am pleasantly surprised on what a great deal it was I love my new phone thanks !
Isabel,4," July 1, 2022",Pink   ,128GB,"package does not come with official apple charger or sim card opener !!phone is real tho, i just think they should‚Äôve made them bigger"
Cameron,4," April 8, 2022",Blue   ,128GB,Almost perfect! The body of the phone is in really good condition I don‚Äôt see any scratches or scrapes or dents or cracks the only issue with the body I see is there‚Äôs some discoloration in the top right corner it looks like the blue was worn off a little bit and is now silver in that one spot I‚Äôve added a photo in the spot everything else with the phone seems to be in really good condition I just wish that discoloration in the top corner wasn‚Äôt there
Melanie,5," August 3, 2022", Blue   ,128GB,"If I didn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd bought a used phone, I would have thought this was new. The battery is at 100% health, I can‚Äôt find any blemishes on the screen or backing, and everything booted up like new. The package even came with a new charging cable and a charging brick. I didn‚Äôt need another brick but it‚Äôs nice that it was there I guess."
Julie Miller,5," August 12, 2022", Starlight   ,256GB,I liked that it could fit in a pocket easily But I needed my glasses to be able to see it and I just need a little extra space I went to the 13 regular but overall I really like the phone it‚Äôs got a lot of features and smooth transitions
Charlene Pint,5," August 12, 2022", Midnight   ,128GB,The mini was smaller than my old IPhone 6.  I thought they were the same  Size.  However I am happy to be able to use all my Apps now!  The old phone did not support a lot of Apps.  Everything set up great and no glitches in getting it activated! Love it!
Salome,5," September 25, 2022", Midnight   ,256GB,"Me lleg√≥ en condiciones excelentes, pr√°cticamente nuevo"
SN,5," July 11, 2022", Blue   ,128GB,"I ordered a pre owned iPhone 13 mini. It arrived in 48 hrs after ordering, much quicker than stated by the seller :) This phone was flawless on the exterior. It has always charged to 100% in the 10 days I have been using it. I have been using it. All other features have full functionality. I‚Äôm so glad I made this choice. Kudos to the seller and the top notch quality of this iPhone 13 mini!"
Kindle Customer,3," September 26, 2022", Pink   ,128GB,"My face recognition is not available, my battery life was at 91% and at first i could not download any apps that didn‚Äôt come with the phone without a credit card. Other than that, the screen and no scratches or cracks and the phone had no dents."
Amazon Customer,5," August 6, 2022", Blue   ,128GB,I needed a new iPhone and I wanted to see if I could save some cash by buying refurbished. The iPhone 13 mini I received was like new no scratches whatsoever. Very pleased. I ended up saving damn near $100 enough to get me a case and screen protector with left over money.
Big pp man,5," September 17, 2022", Midnight   ,128GB,"Zero issues, good service and Great phone condition, I loved it."

Janet M Cook,5," July 27, 2022", Blue   ,128GB,The IPhone 13 Mini is perfect for my use.I love it.  Price was very reasonable too.
First Time Customer,3," May 30, 2022",Midnight   ,128GB,"Looks like the iPhone 13 but fails to provide all the bells and whistles of the real phone, I upgraded from an iPhone SE and the face camera picture quality is identical, the phone will sometimes hick up and glitch a little when changing between apps, doesn't come with the iPhone 13 wall papers and settings, did not come with the recent iPhone 12 update.Walks like a iPhone 13, quacks like one, but just isn't the same. I understand this may be how refurbished phones are but I was expecting it to feel more like the actual iPhone 13."

John Williams,3," March 27, 2022", Blue   ,128GB,"The phone itself is perfectly fine. But the charging cable it comes with is obviously the cheapest one they could get, but it does work. The power brick on the other hand, feels so cheap and has minimal markings on it indicating its safety, that I immediately threw it in the trash and recommend that everyone else does the same. The listing description also says that it comes with a SIM removal tool, which it did not.If you're just here for the phone, and don't care about everything else it comes with, then this thing is great."
Daniel I warum,5," June 10, 2022", Blue   ,128GB,The phone I got had absolutely no scratches and battery capacity was at 100%! The phone was practically brand new for 100 dollars less. 10/10 recommend!

Alex M,5," April 14, 2022", Starlight   ,128GB,My girlfriend loves her new iphone it came in perfect condition no scratches or bumps first time buying a renewed phone from amazon and it was worth buying for.
Jackie,2," August 3, 2022", Midnight   ,256GB,"I had this delivered less than 10 mins ago and it arrived scrapped. The top right portion was scrapped as well as a minor one on the bottom right. The charging port and cable are not Apple brand, they are second hand brands. I have submitted my return request and will be expecting my money back.

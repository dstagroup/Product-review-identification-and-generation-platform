11,1,"Very Happy - Has ""Random"" capability for MP3s","I got this machine primarily for the DVD with MP3 playback. It turns out, that most DVD players with MP3 capability don't allow you to select ""random"" playing of the tracks!??? I replaced my 12 year-old CD player and my sub-par VCR with this one machine. I'm very happy with it so far, although I wish it had another component input in the back. The DVD playback is awesome. The VCR playback seems fine as well, although since getting TiVo, I don't really use it that much. I recommend this to anyone who wants a versatile player of good quality."
14,1,Here is a little secret.,"After you watch a few episodes, it will be fairly clear to you who the two central characters are. If you enjoy a fitting but bleak ending, stop at Season 3, Episode 5. But if you prefer romantic comedies, view through 3/5 then skip to Season 4, Episode 3, as the final act."
20,1,creativity for everyone,did you know this software has been arwarded for parents choice arward 2002 i try this software and it's1# creativity for girls to imspire art in time.
29,1,Fabulous!!!,"After doing alot of researching and reading reviews I purchased Kelly's Pet Parade and it is fabulous.My four year old daughter has has no problems playing it without any supervision. Ability to use the mouse is important.She can keep the different activities as simple or as elaborate as she wants to.When you want to do a new parade you have to use a different name (susie2 etc.) or erase the saved parade.The whole thing is just darling and fun to play. My daughter has to do 30 minutes of a math or alphabet game before she can play Kelly's Pet Parade. So, she likes it so much that using it as a reward has worked."
41,1,Pretty Nifty!,"I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then...like a dummy, I forgot to put them up! Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool. I'd say there's a little bit of educational value too, as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they're depicting. Even though I forgot to hang them up, I really liked these scene setters and I'll be using them next year!"
44,1,The greenest grass imaginable,"I bought this book for my husband. He follows it faithfully, and you can see the results in our yard. We have the most beautiful, lush grass in the neighborhood - which seems to be a miracle, since our yard was an overgrown field just two years ago. Jerry Baker provides simple ways to establish and maintain your lawn. I also appreciate the fact that we do not have to go to a gardening store to find the items recommended in his book."
53,1,"The best book in the ""Night World"" Series","Daughters of Darkness is quite possibly the best book in the new NIGHT WORLD series by L. J. Smith. It does not just revolve around one supernatural being or one singular person, it has interesting information on the werewolves of the NIGHT WORLD and the plot line is out of sight. I own all of the books in the series (Up untill Soulmate that is) and so far Daughters of Darkness is the best one. I only hope the following books in this wonderful series are as great as this one!!"
54,1,It is the best book in the series.,"This book was the best out of the whole series. The book was pretty much about Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel, three girl vampires that just had enough of the Night World. Mary-Lynnette is a small town girl who loves to look at the stars, but has nobody to look at the stars with her. Ash is a tall, lanky, and elegant vampire that has to find his sisters and bing them back home. But of course his sisters had told Mary-Lynnette and her brother, Mark, bout the Night World. Another twist in the story is that Ash and Mary-Lynnette are soulmates. If this story couldn't get anymore exciting there is a vampire killer running around town. All six of them has to figure out who this vampire killer is and stop him. Meanwhile Ash and Mary-Lynnette has to figure out what to do about each other. If you like or are obsess with vampires (Like me!)you should read this book."
56,1,READ IT READ IT READ IT!,"This book is incredible. It had me hooked from the very beginning. Why does everyone always say that they're in love with Ash? He's a great character, but not perfect in any way. Okay, ehough chit-chat. Read this book, I am serious. Rowan (my favorite!), Kestral, Jade, and Mary-Lynnette are just about the strongest female characters I have read in some time. I can find no flaw in any part of this book, and if you haven't already, READ IT!"
63,1,Great Pants,"These are great pants. They are really comfortable and easy to care for. I'm saving money too because I don't have to take these to the dry cleaners. I love the ""Individual Fit"" waste band. Who wouldn't like pants that fit a larger waste size without making you admit the weight gain by buying the larger size."
64,1,Satisfied,"Product arrive well ahead of schedule, met expectations, and price was better than local retail."
69,1,"The hot boys always will keep it real ""they on fire!!!!""",you need to listen to me and buy the hottest cd by the hot boys cause if you like rap like me and you just wanna keep it real leave it up to the hot boys all of cash money they are just off the hook Adam
74,1,It Works!!,"I have been struggling to have my children be more obedient and to stop arguing with and each other. They were unhappy, my husband was unhappy, and I was unhappy. This book gave us not only some general strategies but also some suggestions on what to say in various situations. We are making great progress and the children are using it at school. We are becoming a more happy family!!"
76,1,WeiB FOREVER!,"This is a great CD!! I love WeiB Kreuz!! The anime is awsome! Its bout 4 guys (hhhooottt) who work at a flower shop, but at night they are the White Hunters (or Byce as in the anime) they are assasins that ""hunt the tomorrow"" of Bad guys, the bad guys the police cant get . Like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason... from a strange gas substance that w/ instant contact ingulfs any object... but i couldnt resist. Its also an emotional anime at times! I think this is a Cd and Anime any anime fan should see..."
78,1,Most complete book about HTML i've ever seen.,"This is just the best HTML book I've got my hands on. Just about everything about HTML techniques you could think about is covered in this book. StyleSheets, DHTML, forms, frames .. it's all covered. a MUST have for the HTML-creator The 99 edition is even better than the 98 edition, because the overviews are now sorted by browser, instead of alphabethically."
80,1,Simply awesome,"This book is just spectacular!I have been a web developer for several years now, and I have read many books about HTML and related subjects. This book covers it all. But not only does the author cover HTML extensively, but he also covers XML, XHTML, CSS (extensively), CSS2, JavaScript, CGI, SSI, ASP, Coldfusion, and fonts.Many examples are given in both code and URL, discussion, and the thoroughness of the author's coverage, makes this a first-rate book, in my opinion.Most remarkably, the author discusses this subject matter very simply and in a way that anyone can understand (probably). I've honestly never read a technical book as lucid as this one. I highly recommend it!If that was not enough, the book contains about 500 pages of appendices, covering extensively every topic related to web development that one might need. I'm not saying you won't need any other books to make fabulous web pages, but this book is amazingly comprehensive. The author's web site is nice too."
81,1,A very useful tool,"Very good product. Got my as a gift a few years ago, and it works fine. While mine has mercury thermometers, it shouldn't make a difference from red spirit filled one. I keep it in the shop drawer, dig it out when I wonder abt the temp here in NW Fla, dampen the wick, give it a twirl for a couple of minutes, then read it. I spray a lot of lacquer, shellac, and varnish, and usually have to crank up the dehumidifier in the shop, especially in the summer months. All in all, Bacharach makes a very good and reliable tool."
82,1,One of the best classical music CD,"I have the original soundtrack for FF6 But I still love this CD. Well, since it's not OST so don't expect to hear the original music you heard while playing game. All pieces are played by symphony orchestra and, as a classical music lover myself, I enjoy this CD as much as Vivaldi's Four Season!! Every song was well rearranged and perfectly presented in symphonic style...Warning!! if you're only gamers and don't think any classical music is worth listening, don't buy this CD.. But if you're classical music lovers as well, buy it..!! Whether or not you've ever played the game, the beauty of the music will make you not to regret every penny you spend..!!"
83,1,Perfect glider,It was easy to put together and works nice. Love sitting in it with my grandson and enjoying our time.
92,1,"Cruel & Unusual, was fabulous!",Cruel and Unusual was another wonderful story by Ms. Cornwell. It was graphic in its detail but I stayed rivited to the end. I read everything she writes. None of it is boring and her knowledge of investigative procedures adds to the thrills of her stories.
94,1,Ronnie Joe Waddell meets the electric chair ... or does he?,"If you enjoy medical thrillers, you will enjoy this book. It is evident that Cornwell does her research on her subject & you gain useful information as you read."
96,1,Very nice book,I really liked this book. It is a page turner for sure. I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point.I think that Patricia Cornwell is at her prime in this novel.
98,1,Lovely!,"This is just a wonderful graphic novel with beautiful illustrations, an interesting story set in a different culture. I had not been a fan of graphic novels, but this was one of those that have convinced me that they can, like opera, enhance the experience by using a fusion of art forms. I highly recommend it."
100,1,Fascinating yet tragic,"This was such and interesting book to read. It's about the one person who was the closest witness to the assassination of President Kennedy and how she was persecuted and finally redeemed. Namely Jean Hill. Her story needed to be told. It can't be ignored. She was filmed for Oliver Stone's movie titled JFK. She was cut from the theater production, but it is in the director's cut, which is the one you should see. It chronicles what lengths people will go to silence a dissenting witness. If you have ever seen the Zapruder film of the assassination, then you have seen Jean Hill. She was the woman standing on the curb in a red dress at the ""moment""."
101,1,"Dr. Scarpetta Returns, and So Does Gault!","Prepare to keep the lights on tonight if you're reading ""From Potter's Field""! Enter the dark, even sometimes humorous, world of Dr.Kay Scarpetta, a mystery solving sleuth where you don't expect it! Marino better watch out for his job.Suspense and terror reign through ""Potter's Field"" as well as suprise and intrigue. We once again encounter the evil Temple Gault and seek the identity of his latest victim. Its like mixing horror and mystery and getting the best of both worlds!If you didn't read this book on hardcover, pick it up now on paperback! Unless, of course, you chicken.."
102,1,Great book.,"Not as spell binding as others in this series but still very good. It took getting to the last couple of chapters to understand the title, but that was minor. I also found a alot of typos in this book. usually just minor ones but a name was completely wrong, but correct in the very next sentence. I had to stop for a second and think....who is that? ok...off to Amazon.com to find the next one."
105,1,Scarpetta rocks!,"I love the Kay Scarpetta series, that's how I got hooked on the whole forensics stuff! Patricia Cornwell is an excellent author!"
106,1,Hoping for more!,Adermatt grabbed my attention from the very beginning and kept it to the end. She tells an extremely poignant and relevant story such that I felt I was watching every minute of it in real life. I hope this is the beginning of a series!
107,1,"a brilliant, well-written economics primer","Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the ""common good."" However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand."
108,1,Never more needed than today,"Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and ""higher education"" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda). Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.Here's a revolutionary fantasy: Make this book a required study by all high school students. Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute."
109,1,Economics even you will Understand,"For all who avoided economics like the plague, this is the book for you.very informative, and gives the novice a good foundation of the subject... Check it out.. next time you argue economics with uncle Fred, you wont sound like such a dope"
111,1,A common sense approach to Economics,"Economics in One Lesson is essentially an introduction into the Austrian school of Economic thought. Hazlitt's now renowned treatise originally written in 1946 is lauded by Libertarian stalwarts Ron Paul, Peter Schiff and Lew Rockwell among others. While some of the examples provided in the text may be dated the book is as relevant today as it was when first written. Hazlitt, from a 1940's perspective, takes on many of today's most controversial issues such as government spending, taxes, minimum wage, balance of trade, unions and inflation. In an era of big government, many of Hazlitt's economic lessons come as a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend Economics in One Lesson for those interested in learning about the Austrian School of economics and basic free market priciples."
117,1,A very accessible mathematical classic,"An excellent and lucid exposition of what we really mean when we talk about 2 houses, or 1/2 an hour, or square root of 2 meters, or that the counting numbers are infinite. It does not require any prior mathematical knowledge beyond the basics, although it probably will be of interest only to those that care about math at its most abstract. It is fascinating to realize how much we take for granted when we do math and how much ingenuity it takes to pin down the concept of number. Highly recommended."
121,1,Super handy on trips,"we didn't even use the magnetic feature but glad it had that option. Compact, easy to take (about size of Ipad but thicker). Would recommend for the avid backgammon enthusiasts like us who cannot bear to go too long without playing!"
124,1,Read,"Look a couple inches over ur belly button. Do you have a 'slouch line'? If no, then this is for u. Nice expensive material feel. Does wat it was made to do. It just didn't work out for me cuz I slouch all the time and it hurts where my belly fat curls. It's for those straight sitting people"
129,1,Wow,I ordered my Squeem and it came earlier than promised. Mine didn't fit but it was my error and not the company's. I filed for a return and the company replied promptly with instructions to send back and offered to send me a different size. The company is very polite and courteous. It's one of the better companies selling on Amazon. The product itself from what I was able to do with it was very sturdy. The hook and eye enclosures were easy to use and the Squeem molded to my body shape. It was ridged but had give to allow for movement. The outside that goes away from your body is rubber but what actually touches you is a cotton material. It does smell a little like rubber if you put your nose to it but it's not strong enough to smell if you're wearing it. I can't wait to get my new sized one and try it out.
132,1,"Love, love, love this product!","I bought this with the hope I would look slimmer. It did that, and more! I bought a large, and after a week of wear, I am purchasing a medium. I have gotten complements on how much weight I have lost, and I have actually lost weight too. It gives me a shapely figure. I could not be more pleased."
136,1,Wonderful!,This book was just what I was looking for! HIGHLY informative information on each herb along with lore and magickal uses. It also explains deity correspondences and points out what sabbat you might use each herb for. I recommend this to anyone interested in magickal or medicinal uses of herbs.The product came early and the book was in excellent condition!
137,1,A welcomed change from the frozen plains of Europe,"A refreshing, sunwarmed, beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of Ice Age Europe. A delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive. The plot line moves in different ways from other ""Woman against the odds"" novels so it is a fresh and not predictable. A very good read and a much better choice over Jean Auel's ""Shelters of Stone""."
140,1,i love books,The description was exactly as written. Fast shipping and great costumer service. I would recommend the product and the seller.
142,1,Excellent,"It is Hawthorne, of course it is excellent. Well written and worth a slow, methodical approach. Definitely a literary classic."
161,1,great,i think it is a great comidy just anther adam sandler if you dont like him then this prob isnt a great movie for you but i would still try it
164,1,Finally!,"Oh, my goodness. To all of you reading out there, I have been waiting for this movie's release date for almost a whole year. Ever since the film came out in theaters, I checked amazon.com every day to find out when it would be released and now, I know. Also, this DVD comes out on my birthday. That is cool. Anyway, all my friends who saw this movie and all the reviews I read said that this movie was terrible. I say forget those reviews because this movie is simply amazing. If you like Adam Sandler, then this movie is for you. If you don't like Adam Sandler this movie is still for you. This is by far his best movie ever (Happy Gilmore is his second best). This is a must buy for any Sandler fan. It is warm and witty and has the voice talents of so many people from Adam Sandler's SNL days. Classic movie. You can count on me being there at the store before school buying this. Can't wait!"
166,1,Great desk for the young scholar,We bought this for our tall seven-year old and it is an excellent fit. It was not difficult to assemble and it is very sturdy and the finish is solid - it won't peel off with an accidental piece of tape or scratch. We have a similar set that is in espresso and love it. The kids spill stuff on it and stick things to it and it is still in good condition. This is a big sturdy desk and we highly recommend it.
172,1,Awesome CD and great value!,Couldn't ask for a better transaction. Shipped super fast and item was as described!
179,1,A great family Christmas movie,"Christmas may be a time for joy and laughter, but Charlie Brown has the Blues. To get in the holiday spirit, he takes Lucy's advice and directs a Christmas play. And what's a Christmas play w/o a tree? Everyone makes fun of the short sparse ""nevergreen tree"" that he comes up with, until Christmas works it's true magic.This is a classic family holiday film. It has all the characters that we have known and loved our whole lives. This DVD also contains the ""It's Christmastime Again Charlie Brown"" story. It has English, Spanish, Japanese and Portuguese audio tracks. This is a great way to enjoy Christmas with the whole family or with friends."
185,1,Proof that good things are built to last,"When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music, subject treatment and Linus's Bible reading were unlike anything else tried on TV before. Work was done in just 4 months flat (considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature) and a lot of money and resources were put at stake. Lucky for them - and a lot of us - ""Sparky"" hit the nail on the head. This film was the absolute winner of next year's Emmy awards for television for kids programming, along with more accolades and recognitions. I think the different treatment of the Christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and, in true Peanuts' style, is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious. One of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season."
194,1,Great item!,"The adaptor works really well on my ibook or powerbook. It has a really long extension cord. The only problem is that it is slightly more bulky than the apple one. So, for traveling around, unless you have a big computer case, it will not fit nicely. Other than that, it is great. Much cheaper than a new apple adapter and works just as nicely. It is also sturdier than the apple adaptor and does not have the annoying light."
198,1,Great Solution!,"This Adapter will do the job as good or even better than the original adapter for a fraction of the price. Unless you are deeply in love with the ""cute looks"" and the Apple logo on the original adapter save your self some money by buying this one."
212,1,The Finest Material Available - Period,"I can't express my gratitude at the reviews I've read enough - I remember finding ""Reunion"" in the remainder bin at a Caldor's a couple of decades ago. I couldn't believe what I was listening to when I got it home. How could this album not be a top seller, I thought? ""Wishing Now"" is one of the most achingly joyous, if that's the best way to put it, songs of longing you'll ever hear. ""You Might As Well Smile"" is a masterpiece of soulful humanity. ""The Moon's a Harsh Mistress"" is pure poetry set to music. One of the GREAT albums of all time - period."
214,1,plastic globe pepper/salt grinders,"glass globes would be a welcome addition to thesewonderful little pepper and salt grinders, with 1 hand yet, the glass woul make it feel more professional, or legtitament if you will thnx bert"
216,1,The New Standard Bearer,"BP sets the standard, not just for baseball books but for all annuals of any genre. The depth and breadth of coverage seems to grow each year. Whether you're a fantasy player or a hard core fan, this book is indispensable."
229,1,"One of their best yes, but definitely their most unique.","This is for sure many peoples favorite release from the band, and rightfully so, as it definitely is their most unique record in the catalog in my opinion. Epic and huge sounding, this is a classic album. Everything from killer cover art, to the lyrics... it actually transports you to the place you see on the cover of the album and makes you wonder; who is living in that cold and grim little ice castle that is sitting just on top of hell... or maybe that's just what icechests look like in Norway and they are camping and their campfire needs another log... Either way, this would be the album I would give to someone who has never heard or heard of the mighty IMMORTAL. Metalhead or not, You've never heard anything like this. IMMORTAL RULES!!!"
233,1,Garage Door replacement Circuit,Circuit Board arrived in quick fashion and in good shape. If you are just slightly mechanically inclined you can do this replacement yourself. Maybe the most difficult thing is working on a ladder. Had garage door working in less than 30 minutes.
240,1,I feel my skin with her voice.,"Lahasa, your music touches me in places which needed dusting. your gift reminds me i have a heart, skin, teeth, beauty. thank you. thank you. thank you."
244,1,Best witch book i've ever read!!!,"Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends,and I recomend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come."
249,1,Great series,"I have several titles in this series--they're great! The recipes are easy to make and clearly set out, and there is always an introductory chapter on the herb or spice covered by the book. There are several other titles in this series: coriander, ginger, garlic, chocolate, etc."
260,1,awsome metal dude,its like code red was an album from Sodom.This album is scarey and makes me feel cool
265,1,Great Quality,They were really soft and great quality. No defects (which is always nice lol). The fiance and I both loved them.
267,1,Beautiful and arrived perfect!,"I have been wanting this pattern for some time now, so I finally ordered it (3 actually)and they just arrived, very well packed, not a scratch on them, and on time!And you can't beat the price from Amazon, I saved about $75 on each set!"
280,1,stress reliever,Co-workers stop to comb the sand and ask where I got it. Its a great time out in a stressful environment.
286,1,Greatest Box Set Ever !!,This box set is a MUST-HAVE for all Elvis/Orion fans alike. Booklet is fantastic. Songs are great . Can't wait till the next Orion box set !
289,1,Arrived in great,Book looks great everything that was promised and arrived in great time too. Thanks! Will enjoy reading it and sharing
294,1,CUT IT UP DEF,IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.
302,1,very good product,Great product. i gave this product to my son and i feel much better that he and his family are safer from carbon monoxide. thanks.
304,1,A great collection of songs on this karaoke disc,"1. Suerte - Shakira2. Si Te Vas - Shakira3. Ojos Asi - Shakira4. Te Aviso, Te Anuncio - Shakira5. Objection - Shakira6. Tu - Shakira7. Sombra De Ti - Shakira8. Que Me Quedes Tu - Shakira9. Te Dejo Madrid - Shakira10. Octavo Dia - Shakira11. Ciega, Sordomuda - Shakira12. No Creo - Shakira"
308,1,great fun for the whole family,I have loved Lewis and Martin since I was a child and now I share the fun with my children. My 5 year old loves the hilarious stunts Lewis does and the soda machine scene must be rewound and played over and over. He has tears in his eyes from laughing so hard. I highly recommend for the family.
331,1,Great Update!,"As with his first book, this book has more great information for me as a Type 2 Diabetic. Although my wife is not diabetic, we love ALL the recipe's in both books. They have kept my blood sugar in total control and are delicious! Thanks Dr. Bernstein!"
337,1,A well written and informative book,"I read this book as part of a study I am doing into war on the Eastern Front.I found the book to be excellently researched and well written. For those who are interested in military history and in particular German Military history, I would say it's a must on any good bookshelf"
338,1,I'm keen on Luftwaffe books and this is amongst the best.,"I agree with what esteemed Professor Richard Overy said in his review of this book: ""This is a model of its kind, which ought to set an agenda for the reconstruction of the air narrative in this and other theatres in the greatest of wars."" But I will go further; this book isn't only or even mainly a narrative. It's a powerfully strong piece of operational-level analysis. It is written in a lively and captivating way, which makes the density of analysis easy to cope with. I rate this work very highly."
345,1,fantastic,"This is a wonderful book with bright cute illustrations and a good story. We got one with stickers for Christmas, it was a nice bonus. My son read it 250+ times in the past few years, he is growing up but the book never gets old or boring :o) thank you"
354,1,Worked just like it was supposed to,"This product worked exactly as it was supposed to. I had tried using the cable that came with the camera (USB cord) and found out exactly what many others had said on blogs.....IT DOESN'T WORK!!!Once I got this cable, it worked perfectly. I was able to easily download video from my camera to my computer. The only frustration I had was that I would rather have paid a little more for the camera and gotten this cable with it in the first place."
359,1,Another RA Gem!,"For those of you that read my review for ""From One,"" pretty much what I said in that review is a repeat. This is an excellent CD, though toned down ""From One,"" it still rocks. You can't go wrong with ordering BOTH at the same time (that's what I did). BTW, I think RA does ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"" BETTER than Police originally did it!!! ;^)"
360,1,I don't know what is everyone so disappointed about,"This was my first LJS book, recommended by a friend, who is a book critic. I was hooked on LJS books ever since. I have read every one of her books and have found them excellent."
363,1,Outstanding UFO book,"Having read at least 50 books on UFOs and related phenomena, ""The Mothman Prophecies"" has become one of my favorites along with those of Jacques Vallee. This classic is a must read and reaches the unpopular but most likely true conclusion that UFOs aren't from outer space but are psychic in nature."
364,1,This book is a classic!,"I read it first in the 60's and have never forgotten it. I was pleased when it was reprinted as I had wanted to read it again. It holds up surprisingly well. Keel had realized things about the 'UFO phenomena' then that most other researchers are only now beginning to understand. If you have a sense of wonder, get it. If you are a researcher, get it. If you are an open minded skeptic, this will give you a better perspective. If you're just looking for entertainment, it's a lot of fun."
366,1,Buy it.,"She is a genius, has a lot to say, it's worth hearing, and this hard-to-categorize music absolutely grows on you and becomes your favorite album for weeks once it sinks in. Sound is fun, too, considering lots of toy instruments are used here, and there are a number of producers.M.I.A. is relevant, interesting and makes you pay attention.Buy this album."
368,1,Awesomely Different,"This is something my ears crave; uniqueness. This album has what you need to get loose. With it's wild beats and crazy lyrics, it'll keep you dancing (and in my case, running as well. Good workout music). M.I.A.'s music is not conventional. My guess is, most people either love it or hate it. Enjoy, it's a treat!1. Banana Skit2. Pull Up The People 8/103. Bucky Done Gun 10/10 (My fav. A true dance track. On point)4. Fire Fire 9/105.

371,1,Wha can I get for ten dollah? Anyting you want!,"Definitely spend a couple of bucks more & get this. Maya Arular is one of the few hip-hop sensations who deserves all the hype. Phrases like ""raw talent"" are often used, but what also impress are the musical sophistication and biting wit. This is a hugely appealing sex-war-and-lollipops album, and fears that non-British audiences ""won't get it"" seem to have been unfounded judging by the sales. Exuberant and bursting with energy."
373,1,His Best?,"Well it so hard to pick a favorite Kundrea book because they are all so Brilliant, but I might pick this one."
376,1,"Lyricist, singer, and more!!!!!!!","Bernie is one of the best lyricists out there!!! His vocal performance on this cd and ""Tribe"" show that he is not just a lyric writer, but also someone who loves music. His passion for music has continued on to the formation of the band ""Farmdogs"".I have a question, however. The previous reviews state that this is either Bernie's second or third solo album. What were his first attempts?Please let me know at: Robin@moonsitter.comThank you!!!!"
384,1,A Great Documentary,this documentary tells you the relationship of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddle. and also tells how alice in wonderland was created. this was a very intersting documentary. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
387,1,The best book on Pagan Gods,All too often the Pagan God is forgotten in favor of the Goddess. This book will bring the balance back to our lives. It gives the history of many well know Gods as well as many not so well known Ones. It also includes rituals in direct relation to the Gods listed. I love this book! It goes well with The Witches' Goddess!
390,1,Wonderful app,"I love reading Essence magazine, I am happy I can now read it on my kindle fire. I recommend this"
392,1,Koontz is always good,this book is very good as I have come to expect of Dean KoontzI've been reading his books as long as he has been writing them and am never disappointedI wish the 3rd book was coming sooner but i'll take it when I can get it
401,1,Great Camcorder,"Excellent camcorder, does very well in all kinds of light. I have had no trouble with it indoors, and I find that it performs very well in low light. Flawlessly performs with Windows Movie Maker 2 through firewire. The sound is outstanding, considering the picture is it's strong point. I did not need the digital camera built in as I already have one. Effects are fun to play around with, especially with the handy scroll button. I have not heard the motor noise at all, so I can't see where that is coming from. My only complaint is that it shuts off too quickly if inactive, but it's really not that much of a problem. Image stablizer works really well, as I often have an unsteady hand but it is hardly noticeable with this camcorder. I just wish they made a VCR that could record the footage as well as it was taped!"
405,1,A fine novel about a forgotten time,Houston exaggerates for effect--not all of the historical characters that he uses were actually at Bisbee. But how could anyone resist using the bigger-than-life leaders of the IWW?
420,1,SO Expensive BUT...,Great product! I have used many a skin care product and this was by far the best one. But because its so expensive i have to buy it sparingly. (Im not a high roller) I have ordered this product twice in the last year and it works right away. The problem is you really have to use them all in 30 days or the pads will dry up on you. This is dissapointing since i really dont need to use them everyday. Nonetheless this product works...if i had the money i would keep a ready supply in my cabinet.
424,1,Magic Malamud,"Malamud does three or four tricks in his fiction well, and here he does each one to utter perfection. And when taken together, this collection of stories almost transcends Malamud's normal limits: the stories are compressed, short, and below the surface, charged with almost unbearable tension. Unlike other collections of stories (or when you read too many Malamud stories) Malamud does not parody himself in the Magic Barrell. Everything is where it is supposed to be, and works like a well oiled machine. It is a shame that (as of writing this) only eight people have reviewed this masterpiece of a short story collection. In Roth's The Ghost Writer, Zuckerman explains that the world's morality has already passed by the E.I. Lonoff's (a character based on Malamud). Seems Roth was correct... and this is true even more today, thirty years after the publication of The Ghost Writer. We no longer live in Malamud's world, and it is a shame."
426,1,"An intelligent, broad-ranging book","James Gifford has given us a book immense in its scope, detailing the works of one of Science Fiction's Grand Master, and one of the genre's most prolific authors.The format is very reader-friendly. The individual entries for each work are fascinating for any Heinlein lover, and the bibliography and opus list will prove invaluable to new readers who wish to delve into Heinlein's universe. Truly a landmark achievement in research and clarity."
433,1,Just so tragic!,"I can't believe how tragic this book is! I picked up this book with an unexpected decision. The book I was supposed to read was Queen of the Damned, but then I saw this book and the cover appealed to me. So I decided I'll read it. At first it was kinda boring, until the last 1/3 of the book, I was so depressed by it...how fate was toying with them, and how their characteristic had decided their fate............Anywayz, this is truly a wonderful book, either by plot, writing, background, history, religion, describtion, etc etc, it's all with perfection. Read it, even though the beginning part might be kinda boring, it's for you to understand it better.I'd recommend this book to anybody, and if you like tragedies, you definitely *have* to read it!!"
434,1,"Deliberately frustrating, occasionally profound, great read.","About fifteen years ago, this book was almost universally considered Hardy's great masterpiece. However, times have changed and its relevance is not as immediate as that of Hardy's last novel, Jude the Obscure. Still, the message of this book is far from foreign. Hardy's gift for creating sympathetic characters seems infinite in magnitude. His prose is unique and at times more harrowing in tone than Conrad's. This book would be a great introduction to the work of one of the great masters of English Literature."
443,1,I recommend this,"I thoroughly enjoyed Tess, even though it left me raging and gnashing my teeth at times. No picture of Victorian life can be complete without reading this book first."
447,1,Light and easy to use,The Swagman XTC-4 Cross-Country Hitch Mount Rack is lighter than other bike racks and is easy to attach to vehicle. The attachments are easy to move and adjust to each bike that is put on it. Will be enjoying using this product for a long time. Seems to be very durable.
448,1,Solid Rack,"A little heavy, but a good solid rack. Its great for any size bike or tires! No problems what so ever! I'd recommend it to anyone but the weak!!!"
454,1,Classic,"When I heard they were making a file of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, I thought, ""good luck!"". The main gist of the book is philosophical, a hard quality to translate on film. But Kaufman does it here, with the help of Daniel Day-Lewis - and manages to improve upon the book, adding color, humor, and a profound sense if intimacy. A touching and beautifully done love story."
459,1,"A literate, moving film","I served in the Peace Corps in E. Europe in the early 1990s; this movie conforms to my experience of Prague, the Czech people, and E. European literature so completely as to take my breath away. Creating a full movie out of the first 26 pages of Milan Kundera's original novel is scriptwriting brilliance. The film's breadth and depth of each character, the larger-than-life issues played out against the seeming frivolity of the Prague Spring--and its tragic historic aftermath--never fail to impress me. This film has a very European sentiment regarding sexuality/sensuality, however; it is as woven into the fabric of daily life as a glass of fine wine. If you prefer more staid fare, I'd recommend many excellent British films."
469,1,EXPERIENCE A NEW AGE.,"Shutters come down, safety inside, exile at home, this is more than just the best CD in the world.... This is the beginning of a new music age."
470,1,"Extremely rare type of pleasant ""art"" music from these ages.","I first heard a track on the tv while I was doing something else. In a program reviewing new music. I was astonished. It didn't sound at all as all the other worthless types of modern pop. The first parallell I made was to the ""old"" 10cc. But of course, anyone who knows about Beach Boys, Brian Wilson and the ""Pet Sounds"" album would rather like to refer to those. I will go and buy at least two of the albums."
472,1,Less cold...more bouncy,"Wow! With ""Snowbug"", a return trip to ""Hawaii"", Sean O'Hagan and friends have created their most accessible CD yet. While retaining the Wilsonesque arrangements for the most part, the vocal aspects of the production have been honed to a more refined level, thanks in part to the inclusion of more female background vocals. Gone are the avant-garde electronic-bloop excursions of ""Cold and Bouncy"". The new direction on this CD is the incorporation of Brazilian influences into the already exotic High Llamas cocktail. These developments in the band's sound gives ""Snowbug"" a warmer overall feel than any of their previous efforts. I don't see how any critics could argue the true excellence of this collection of songs, though many have pointed to the Llamas too-strong Beach Boys influence in the past. It is unassailable in it's musical genius, a beautiful work of art."
481,1,I love this series!,I like the new love interest in this movie a lot. Also this is a great extension of the last two movies. i can't wait for a 4th to come out.
491,1,Love Transformers,"I really liked this movie. I own the first two on DVD and despite what a lot of people think of Michael Bay's movies, I took this for what it was: a fun movie bringing an iconic childhood toy to life. I grew up watching the cartoons and was really excited when I heard there were going to be live action movies. Now I did enjoy this movie more than the second one, not that I hated Revenge of the Fallen. I loved the action sequences and the special effects. I admit I watch them more for the actual Transformers than the human actors. I didn't care for Patrick Dempsey's character. I don't watch Grey's Anatomy so I have no attachment to him as an actor and I really didn't like Rosie Huntington-Whitley. Sorry, but she shouldn't quit her day job. Acting just isn't her thing. Other than that, I loved the movie. I'm waiting until the collector's edition is released later this year. I have to have my special features."
493,1,Transformers,This item worked as advertised and excellent customer service. I would do business again in the future with this vendor.
502,1,"best movie made to date, and fast shipping",Seen the movie at the theatre and knew then it was going to be a must buy on blu ray when released. Amazon always delivers promptly and on the release date.
505,1,marine,thanks for getting my movie here so quick. we really enjoy and its in great shape that is great thanks
512,1,Great Jam!!,This is truly wonderful gooseberry jam. It is packed with chunks of gooseberries. I highly recommend this product!! It truly met my expectations.
513,1,Amazingly beautiful trance cd.,This is the perfect cd to put in after a night of partying. Great to chill out to. Track 5 and 6 are just amazing.
514,1,awesome,This has to be the best group of performers I've ever enjoyed. I've seen them 4 times.. well 5 times.. once on the 55 freeway.. :P This is cd is very creative and will set you in the mood that will take your mind away from everyday life.. GET IT!!! -Darkpeace (Moontriber 4 life)
516,1,Excellent Boots!,"These boots are an excellent value. They are comfortable, provide great heel and ankle support, good grip, and keep your feed warm and dry in cold climates.Purchased a pair for a vacation in New Brunswick, Canada. These boots kept my feet dry and comfortable the whole time, even while snow shoeing and hiking across a snow covered beach front. Didn't slip once in them, though I encountered ice a few times.Very good purchase!"
524,1,A powerful anti-war film.,"This is not only a spectacular and stunning piece of film making, it is a powerful anti-war film. If you can watch this film today and not be haunted and disturbed by it, you are not paying attention. I watched it recently for the first time in over 20 years and came away shaken. I can't help but wonder if it is not on DVD because there are people who do not want this film to be widely available. As it is now, you have to dig for it. If more people watched this film they might be asking questions our ""leaders"" would rather have left unasked. If you have not seen this film, or it has been a number of years since you saw it last, I can recommend it. It is not an overt anti-war film with an explicit anti-war message, but after seeing it, you will not view world events with the same eyes you did before, I promise."
525,1,ONE OF MY FAVORITE DIRECTORS AND FILM,"DAVID LEAN COULD HAVE DIRECTED ALMOST ANY FILM HE WANTED AT THIS TIME IN HIS CAREER, AND HE CHOSE THIS PROVOCATIVE AND EMOTIONAL STORY OF A LITTLE TOWN IN IRELAND. THIS MOVIE IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER OF HIS, INCLUDING THE EARLY ONES. THE CASTING IS SUPERB, COULD NOT BE BETTER RIGHT DOWN TO THE SMALL ROLES LIKE MAUREEN. I SAW IT WHEN I WAS 13 WITH MY PARENTS WHO WERE LEAN FANS. ITS HIS BEST FILM, TREATED BY SOME AS HIS WORST FILM. I EXPECTED TO SEE ALEC GUINESS IN IT, BUT THERE IS NO REAL ROLE FOR HIM. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PEOPLES LIVES IN THE FILM IS AMAZING AND I THINK AHEAD OF ITS TIME FOR 1970 FILM VIEWERS."
541,1,Quilts from the Smithsonian,"I'm a quilt lover, and my favorite are old scrappy quilts. I do alot of quilting myself, but as a result of my love for quilts I also collect quilt books. One of my favorites is this little books from That Patchwork Place, Quilts from the Smithsonian by Mimi DietrichThe book has pictures and patterns of 12 great quilts from the Smithsonian collection, from a simple Plaid Patch to the more complexed Chesapeake Rose, and The Lilies of the Quilters. There are all colored pictures all through the book, and the there are easy to follow directions helping you to make your own quilts for future generations to love. Or if you are not a quilter the book si a perfect coffee table book with all it's colors and inspirations.Britt Arnhild Lindland"
543,1,Never gets old,"Having just finished Greg Bear's brilliant ""Foundation & Chaos"", I've decided I can no longer wait to begin re-reading the original again. I wish I could take the next few months to start off with the Robot series, move on to the Galactic Empire series, and then finsh with the entire collection of the Foundation books (because it's all one big wunnerful story, doncha' know!). Well, not this year, perhaps, but in a few I may do just that. In the meantime, I will re-read ""Foundation"" with yet another new perspective of Hari Seldon and all that came before this original masterpiece... it truly never gets old."
563,1,DIRTY HARRY MOVE OVER,"Imagine Dirty Harry with a bad coke habit, played by Nicolas Cage in New Orleans. Cage gives us an outstanding performance as someone who goes though those violent coke induced mood swings. The iguana which appears in the movie from time to time is symbolic of the metaphor ""monkey on the back."" Cage is investigating a brutal family execution and interweaves his personal failings into the process. His girlfriend is a prostitute who he protects and supplies drugs. He has a gambling habit, and owes money (bets too much on LSU) and of course steals from the evidence locker. He also shakes down people for information, even grandmothers. Makes Dirty Harry look like a sissy. Lots of drug use, bad language, sexual situations, and some violence. Good story. Plot fairly simple to follow. The movie, at time, has the feel of a dark comedy."
564,1,"Not for everyone, but if it's for you - you're in luck","Arguably one of Werner Herzog's best films. Cage packs a punch with some intense acting. Of course it's edgy and not for everyone as well as pushes the limits of traditional film-making. Get tranced by extra-long shots of wildlife as the music trips you into a 'though-you-were on drugs' daze. Quirky humor, crazed rants and a man breaking all the rules in a wreckless but focused and effective way. I'm not one to watch movies more than once, but have seen this one at least three times."
565,1,Underbelly Regency Style,"This book shocked me, educated me and was truly a page turner.I purchased this book as I am doing some research into the period and it didn't disappoint. The book focuses on the darker side of life which is present in every society in some form.If you are looking to understand our history and human nature you will discover that soccer hooliganism is nothing new."
567,1,funny bone laughter,"If you want to laugh and laugh hard this is the DVD to purchase, also this DVD will bring back memories of the late 70s when Tv comedy was at it's best.i give this DVD a 2+ thumbs up. Looking 2 purchase season 2 soon!!.."
568,1,first season of Three Company,Loved Three's Company when I used to watch it on TV Land so I had to get the first season. Would love to eventually get all the seasons of it. It is a great comedy show not like the so called comedy today that I personally think should be called sick or dark comedy.
572,1,A OK ~ Three's Company Season 1,"I'm glad Three's Company was put on DVD. It was a good show back in its days and it is still a good show. I can't wait to buy the Second Season when it comes out in the spring of 2004. If you have never seen any of the shows, I suggest you start watching and own this DVD. You won't stop laughing."
587,1,Cult Classic,"In the near furture, the high ways of tomorrow are no longer a safe place. Gangs of bikers and kamikaze lunatics roam the long stretches of road that populate the stretch of land known as the Austrailian outback. Mel Gibson soars as the tough futuristic cop Mad Max in this extreme action thriller that started it all. Amazing non-computerized stunts make this movie a treat to watch over and over again. After his wife is brutally murdered by an evil group of bikers, Max sets out on a crazed revenge, earning his heading ""Mad"". Grinding action sequences and Gibson's cool headed attitude make Han Solo look like second hand trash. Just like what Star Wars did for sci-fi, this movie revolutionized action movies for all time, setting the standard of today."
589,1,One of the greatest Arthur tales ever.,"This is the book I read as a child and loved, then read again as a man and loved more. It is part of how I see the King Arthur legend. I will never part with my copy, and I will read it to my son when I have one."
591,1,Trout Does it Again!,"Like all of their CD's, Trout fishing in America has done it again! Fun, entertaining music that is great for adults, kids...whomever!Trout continues to be one of my favorite groups out there-- it's amazing that they do not get more national publicity."
593,1,ORGASM OF THE WORD,"Burroughs searches in his writing for the same thing he searched for in drug use, sex and the russian roulette games he played with his guns: to try and distill out of an experience the pure essence of what it means to be alive, that single moment of ecstasy when living is made real in a blinding flash. Through graphic imagery of sex and death Burroughs will play you like a miscreant attacking a cathedral pipe organ, pulling out all the stops, feet pounding all the pedals at once, hands stomping the keys, blasting the pipes. In that rush of noise he challenges you to find the whisper of truth. A Liturgy and Scripture for the Damned."
596,1,It was the best Night World book!,Compared to all the night world books this one is the best! I love how Rasheal is so brave and finds her soulmate while fighting vampires.
603,1,Very pretty and good quality,My two year absolutely loves puzzles and this has been a great addition to our collection.. It's sturdy and I don't think she'll be able to wear it out or break it.
604,1,Really great shoes,"I love these shoes. I live in Dubai where it is currently hotter than you can imagine, yet I have 2 dogs that need daily walks. I wanted something that gave me comfort and support while walking but without the heat of socks and shoes. I bought these shoes last week and have worn them every day since. They are so supportive yet comfortable, I feel like i could run in them, yet I barely feel like I'm wearing anything! This was my first pair of Merrells - over the week I bought 2 more pairs :)"
607,1,Great movie and soundtrack,"I loved the movie EVITA and rented it so many times, the movie store eventually sold it to me. The songs are upbeat and there's a variety, so it kept my attention. Banderas and Madonna made a great pair!"
610,1,Great value,I love how high it gets - I have bad knees and have trouble getting up from a position where my knees are bent more than 90 degrees - and it is so easy to set up
612,1,Fantastic Bed,"I bought this bed, for my niece who was visiting. The bed was so simple to put air in it, took about 3 minutes or less and very comfortable, did not have to put more air in it the whole weekend. It was much better than the Aerobed, and cost less. I have been through three of them, which didnt last past two years. It was well worth the purchase, will buy another one. Fast shipping too."
613,1,Great Product A++++++,It fills up really fast and is a sweet bed. Best Airbed ever!!!! A must buy item.... Fast shipping as well =)
617,1,Excellent product!,I was very happy with the airbed that I chose - it met all my expectations - service was excellent.
624,1,What a deal!,This is an incredible air mattress. We purchased this for a last minute house guest. It was shipped quickly. The mattress itself is very nice and comfortable. And the automatic pump makes blowing up and deflating a breeze!!! I would highly recommend to anyone needing an air mattress
626,1,Excellent product!,"One of the best air mattresses I've owned. Extremely easy to fill and let the air out, just plug in and flip a switch. I like that it's all one unit, the plug and air in/out take is attached and hidden in a compartment. It's comfortable and does not loose air, even over an extended period of time."
627,1,Most Excellent,Love it! this bed fits the bill. my guess like it compliments on how comfortable it is. Easy to inflate and store. An excellent buy in my book. The built in pump is a super feature.
631,1,Easy to inflate - comfortable,"I bought one and it was so easy to use and quick to inflate, that I ended up buying one for a family member as well. The pump is build right into the mattress so you don't have to worry about misplacing the pump as with many other air mattresses. Inflates in just a few minutes and the pump is not as loud as other pumps I've had in the past."
639,1,"A ""Must Have"" for any FleetwoodMac Fan!!!","By far, one of the best videos I've ever purchased. This video takes each band member down memory lane and you get a wonderful inside scoop to what was really going on behind the scenes making Rumors. Stevie, Christine, Lindsey, John & Mick tell of how their very personal struggles with each other had to be put aside for the survival of the band. With all the emotions running in high gear, no wonder this was their best album yet. I had to watch it a couple of times...Remarkable video about a remarkable band."
646,1,Motifs for stitchers,"This is a wonderful book: the spiral bound format makes it perfect to work from. The motifs themselves are clearly presented and lend themselves to stitching on all manner of items.From bookmarks to babywear, from towels to tableclothes: there is something here for every stitcher!Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
647,1,Highly recommended,"In this extremely useful book for understanding the poetry of Wallace Stevens, Lensing effortlessly traces the poet's life and development as those were important in determining the sort of writer Stevens would become. Many Stevens poems are explicated in terms of their original context, and a lot of fascinating information is provided about the nature of the poetry ""establishment"" of the early 20th century, and how important such sponsorship and networking was for Stevens' emergence as a major voice.This book deserves much more attention from Stevens fans that it seems to enjoy. It is very well written, a work of erudition and scholarship that avoids the all of the pedantry and other typical negatives of its genre. If you're a reader of Stevens, this is a book well worth owning."
648,1,Brings Pogroms & Antisemitism into a sharp perspective.,"Potok, a master of the written word and an accomplished artist, recreates New York ""ghetto-life"" and makes it live through the eyes and life of a young boy growing up in New York between the two World Wars. The sensitive reader will experience unthinking hate, intolerance, love, intellect, and most of all, the perserverance of the human spirit--a vividly painted portrait of human existence and spirituality."
649,1,"The Gentle, Sensitive Intellectual","Averse to books (and movies) with gratuitous sex and violence? Try Chaim Potok. His books tend to honor the gentle, sensitive intellectual (see Elaine Aron's writings on highly sensitive people). In this book, you follow the childhood of David Lurie, a Jewish boy growing up in 1930s and '40s Bronx (New York). An early injury leaves him physically weak and vulnerable to teasing, but his scholarly talents, vivid imagination, and tight-knit community allow him to grow into a fine young adult with the courage to forge his own way, even when that means challenging some of the religious values of his family and friends."
650,1,A smart analysis of an understudied aspect of culture,"The movie industry in India is the world's largest. Steve Derne's book takes this idea and runs with it, using the film industry as a lens for focusing on Indian men's ideas about gender. It's a commonplace that, while people might not talk about their personal attitudes with a stranger, they are more than willing to discuss similar issues in their favorite films, and thus this report (as the very good previous review shows) reveals some surprising insights about how Indian men perceive the construction of masculinity.This book, unlike many sociological texts, is both scholarly and readable, and would make a good addition to undergraduate or graduate courses in area and gender studies. Highly recommended."
654,1,That wonderful laugh!,"Many here have commented how more relaxed Barbra appears to be on this live performance disc compared to earlier ones.No where is this more evident than in the many instances you hear her infectious, lilting laugh.As a student of Ms. Streisand I always treasued those brief moments of hearing that laughter on earlier concert recordings.She says she has been enjoying the concert tour and all that heartfelt laughter we hear is testament to that fact. But I guess it's not surprising that someone who sings so gloriously laughs so gloriously also."
657,1,Streisand: Live in Concert (2 CD's),This is one of the best CD's of all her concerts. I was lucky enough to go to her concert in Los Angeles and it was fantastic. The CD makes you feel as if you are there listening to her wonderful voice. ILDivo performs and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a Streisand fan.
663,1,My Favorite Shakespeare,"The language wraps you up and transports you to a time and land like no other. It's full of love, hate, brutality, and loyalty. All these emotions get tangled up and mixed together. That lends itself to an amazing set of circumstances. There is no greater love story than Juliet and her fair Romeo. All other love stories are measured against this one and you will get lost in this classics story. It's a true classic."
669,1,Great book,This book not only a classic but a real journey(not really but just saying) the only thing I dislike about this book is the names at the sides. If you are looking for a script this is the best thing told use. Plus at the book defines some uncommon words with numbers beside them that are defined in the next page. A true five star book!
674,1,Consecrated Masterpiece.,"I got goosebumps in 1987 the first time I heard Dr. Van Steiner @ 1'26"", still today in 2011 the same.Let me take this CD to heaven."
682,1,Great book,I enjoyed this book. I needed to read a book like this. There are feelings I need to change about myself and this book made me realize it.
687,1,Amazing wealth of info,"Almost 500 pages! The author, Fritz Springmeier, shares a tone of info that's mind blowing. It may not all be 100% true yet just a fraction of it being true is astounding. A highly recommended read.This book, though out of print, is freely available in PDF format, at the time of writing this review. If you search for its title on Yahoo there will be some links showing the PDF format for download. One of the sites it can be found on is ministryoflies-com.Springmeier also has a one hour video that can be freely watched. It's also under the same title as the book, and can be better found by searching with Google in the Video section of the search options. It's not as comprehensive as the book but worthwhile. God bless."
692,1,A Mostly True Adventure,One of my top books of my 7 decades of reading! Love the way it's told in the voice of the 13-year-old. Great descriptions of the French setting in the country!!
697,1,"KIng Rat, tied with Shogun, is the best of Clavell's Asian..","King Rat, tied with Shogun, is the best of Clavell's Asian Saga. He incorporated, and illustrated the very core of what it is to be a man. What makes this book an instant classic, is the simple, yet horrific, setting. Also, Clavell was able to fill each page with such meaning, he didn't have to make a several-hundred-page-behemoth of a book in order to digest the meaning within it. Compelling was the depth that a man falls to in such a desolate existance, and the measures required to lift a man up to some degree of dignity. For his ability to depict the strength of charicter of this western man in asia, Clavell has earned a place of honor among the great novellest of our time."
700,1,Love Mozart,"Loved the documentary about Mozart. I learned things I never knew about him. Too bad he died so young, can you imagine the amount of music he could have written?"
712,1,"Feminisim restored to flesh, blood, & fire.","The blockheadedness & utter insensitivity of the two reviews below, in an open forum such as this, demand a response.Frances Sherwood's reimagining of the life of the brave Mary Wollstonecraft, the woman who wrote the groundsbreaking ""Vindication of the Rights of Women,"" proves quite the equal of her subject. Sherwood brilliantly recreates her protagonist's haunted Enlightenment world, at once alive with new ideas & half-smothered in medieval fears & prejudice. Better still, however, her history goes far beyond the merely correct, investing its conflicts with the chilled yet heightened humanity they must've engendered at the time. The ""Mary"" of this book has the wallop of her namesake, providing a new testament to women's toil & tragedy while never losing her humor, her smarts, or her desires."
716,1,That's Italian!,"This book is not only a must for vegan kitchens but for everyone who likes Italian food. The recipes make very authentic tasting vegan versions of popular dishes. My vegan friends are enjoying this food too, always the best sign."
727,1,bithday gift,"it was a gift for my son he use to have the smaller version years ago . so, when i saw this i new he would enjoy it. thank you."
733,1,As Expected,It was what I expected it was and told me what I needed to know. It's a very worthwhile purchase
735,1,Wonderful Recipes for a Quick and Healthy Meal!,Another great purchase of the Sandra Lee cookbooks to add to my collection. Recipes so quick and easy to prepare. ~ Thank you Sandra Lee for making cooking enjoyable again for women everywhere!
737,1,One of the best,"Good variety of recipes, complete with brand names and suggestions....pictures are gorgeous. Good for the new or experienced but busy cook."
740,1,Helter Skelter,"I was 16 years old the summer of 1969 and remember it vividly. I didn't read Helter skelter until I was 22, when it first came out and learned for the first time many of the detail, and the book truly stays in your mind. That is what most of the other reviews say that it haunts you for many years and you actually feel that you are there on that hot summer night, Sharon and Jay talking in the bedroom and a strange woman walks in and orders them to the living room. How terrifying could it have been for Sharon watching Jay die in front of her and Frykowski and Folger fighting for their lives knowing very well her unborn child and her couldn't defend themselves. Bugliosi wrote with such compassion for the victims and we can truly thank him that these people are behind bars now. Watching Charles Manson talk on television shows how unremorseful he is and will always be."
747,1,America's best prosecuting attorney is also a great author.,"This is an excellent book on one of the most horrific crimes ever committed even by today's standards. The research, details, and explanations are absolute top-notch. It is evident that Vincent Bugliosi is one the greatest prosecuting attorneys ever to step into the courtroom. The way he can rationally reconstruct the events of a crime and get into the heads of the criminals and lay out their motives is just amazing. The courtroom drama is re-created in dramatic detail so you can feel the tension, suspense and horror all throughout the trial. We also learn alot about cult psychology and how people can be driven to extreme bahavior. What's even scarier is that there are people in this world like Charles Manson's fanatical followers ready to do his darkest bidding."
755,1,great for card players,"Works well, especially for arthritic hands. Use it once a week with group I play cards with and having more fun due to less hand pain."
756,1,LOVED THEM,"All of us girls loved the card holders. It did have an odor, but I sprayed them with Fabreeze and let them dry, then washed with soap and water and let them dry again. After that all was fine. We find that we even use them when we have 3 cards left. You can set it on the table and it leaves your hands free for important things--like snacks!"
758,1,Perfect for a ten year old,I bought this for my ten year old daughter so she could play canasta with her grandmother. Her little hands did not allow her to hold all the cards. With the card holder she enjoys the game a lot more. I think they are grooming her as a substitute in the Canasta league!
762,1,crowsfoot tools,"never thought i would need these, but they have come in handy numerous times since i bought them. quite well made."
766,1,Good,I have not really had a chance to use these but my daughter states that it works for her very well.
770,1,The Odyssey,"I think the movie 'The Odyssey' was great. You would think for this movie that the special effects would be really bad, but they wern't. 'The Odyssey' is about a man called Odissius. He and his wife Penelope had a son. But on the day Oddisiusses son was born he had to go to the Trojan war. The story has many twists and turns as he goes through the jorney of trying to get back home."
771,1,"Armande Asante, need I say more?",This movie is fabulous. Anyone who is a fan of greek mythology or the Roman era would love this movie.I cannot get enough of Armande Asante and this movie portrays him in a way that would make any woman drool.Definitely a great buy. {^_^}
782,1,Very good introduction to the field,The authors takes time to explain the basic hypotheses of statistical mechanics. I believe that it is an excellent introduction to this field.
783,1,No better place to start with Stat Mech,"If you are intrested with studing statistical mechanics then start here. Hill starts from the defintions and postulates of thermodynamics and then moves into applications and problems. You will need to understand Diff EQ for this book.The first chapter took me a week to read and work out the math but then I red the rest in 4 weeks. It is a hard start because Hill develops your background before starting with applications of the theory. I really began to grasp the subject after reading this book. Ohter books will not lay the mathout as well as Hill does. It is a hard read because Hill is so thorough, but the rewasd is well worth the struggle. It is a great introduction and I suggest all of Hill's Stat mech book. Another great bargin from DOVER PRESS.At the price I recomend it to all graduate chemical engineers and chemists"
785,1,Perry is now two times as classy!,"William Monk awakens in a Victorian-era London hospital with amnesia. Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon"
793,1,High-art!,"I must say, i avoided this movie like the plague for a year. It was deemed to me to be just a sacchrine ""chick-flick."" Now I have to ask myself...what were you waiting for? This movie which I now own, definitely deserves more praise and should be essential to anyone intrested in high-art. It's a magical and uplifting tale set in some of the most beautiful locations in Italy. Diane lane sparkles! She carries the film so well you forget she's only acting. A remarkable movie, filled with poignant characters and a heartbreaking story-line. It's message is one that transcends time and gender. Watch and learn...it's fabulous!"
798,1,wonderful movie,"This is a great movie. Views of the Tuscan towns and other scenery make you want to hop on a plane for Italy. The movie content was both funny, entertaining, and a travel advertisement."
805,1,Under the Tuscan Sun,"If you like romantic movies, this is the perfect one for you. But, please don't cry! It was a gift for someone else, eventhough I personally had seen it. It arrived just in time and I could keep track (via UPS) where it was, since I purchased it being in Puerto Rico."
814,1,Same as original!,"A must have for your SD950IS, because you never know when you need a backup battery!"
815,1,Quality battery,I can't imagine not having a spare battery for my camera. I bought this for my 1st Canon Powershot camera and it works exactly as you would expect. I was even more excited when I discovered that my new Canon Powershot uses the same batteries. Now I have 3...the ones that came with each of the cameras plus an extra.
816,1,Very Very Pleased,Great price on a genuine Canon battery.Reasonable shipping cost.Arrived in reasonable time.
820,1,The Pledge of Allegiance,This book is beautifully illustrated with photographs that are sure to spark discussion. The text (the Pledge of Allegiance) is broken into meaningful phrases that make the reader reflect on the words that we sometimes rush through or take for granted. I highly recommend purchasing the big book version for lower grade classroom use. A gem!
825,1,I love this book!,"I'm a big fan of Vickery's ever since I read his previous book, Cocksure. I have to say that as good as Cocksure was, Play Buddies is even better! Not only are his stories hot, Vickery writes with real humanity, making his characters come across as real and three dimensional, out on the prowl, looking for sex wherever they can find it. As far as erotic writing goes, Vickery is a master!"
828,1,What a debut!,"This album was not death metal or even thrash metal by today's standards. It was, however, an incredible debut that I ended up owning on cassette, album form, and finally, CD. Unfortunately, Nasty Savage sounded best when they werent trying to be heavy. Some bands do (Metallica, Possessed come to mind immediately), just check out the incredible original version of XXX (available on Metal Massacre 6) and then listen to the much faster, more aggressive, and much less interesting version on the CD 'Indulgence' and see what I mean.)This album is actually very good ""idontknowwhatyouwouldcategorizethisstuffas"" metal for this time period. For some reason, they decided to use more death metal growls and faster beats on future records and that made them sound like they were trying to do too much....This album is their crowning glory."
834,1,A grim and gritty travel masterpiece,"Tabasco and Chiapas in the 1930's - not a nice place either to live or to visit. Greene's explorations provided background and some characters for his great short novel or tale, The Power and the Glory. If you are a student of fine writing, read the novel first, then read this to see how he gathered and used material. Or read this first for background that adds depth to the novel. If you are an armchair traveler or student of Mexico, enjoy Greene's adventures and be grateful he went through them so you don't have to do it yourself. This is truly a classic of travel writing."
836,1,It really is the Gluten free Bible,Packed with great information.Great for people like myself just diagnosed with Celiac Diseasefunny friendly fact filled! The one recommended by my nutritionist!
839,1,Good for storage and for being less breakable than hard cases,"This item is good for storage of cds and is less breakable than the harder cases. Wish I'd have bought and may buy more of them than harder cases, which can crack."
847,1,tremendous skin flick - one worth owning,"No plot, very little talking, tons of high-quality flesh - all you could hope for from this genre in one package"
849,1,Dell E207WFP Monitor,"This monitor, when it first came out, received rave reviews and I have not been disappointed. Since first buying it a few years ago, I have since added two additional ones as well. I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a older model that performs well."
852,1,To Jake Song,"Jake Song ""Jake"" (New Jersey USA) this is for you remember when you said ask you if anyone wants to know the glich to get any battle chip you want. [...]"
854,1,cooker,This is a book I had when I was in the first grade. I recently started cooking with my eight year old and hoped this book was still out there. I have never seen it it a bookstore and there it was on Amazon and for less than three dollars!! It was exactly the way I remembered it. We have already made several of the things in the book. We have a lot of fun looking at the pictures and following the directions and the together time is great! A classic forever!
858,1,Wonderful!,"Consider what might have happened to England if Dracula had survived Stoker's novel. This is the premise upon which Newman's story is built. Fortunately, his knowledge of Victorian history and literature is matched only by his brilliant ability as a storyteller. Newman is one of the best!"
860,1,Crucial Confrontations,Excellent book. Easy directions and explanations to implement the Crucial Confrontation Model.
861,1,Best Business Tool Ever!,"Knowing I had to face a crucial confrontation I looked for answers to help me in this uncomfortable situation; and, I found them!! Not only is the information valuable in business but it applies to family and life in general. Recommend it to anyone that has a hard time facing confrontations. It is written in a way that is both easy to understand and to apply. The information flows in a format that makes total sense."
869,1,A page-turner!,"I could not put this book down! The story is riveting and heartbreaking, and the writing is fantastic -- this reads like a novel more than a true crime. I felt like I was right there as the horrifying events unfold, and as the family deals with the tragedy and the injustices that follow. What I admired most is how the author, herself in the center of the story, manages to be so generous in its telling. We go into the heads and viewpoints of each family member as well as the four killers, and as a result we get a nuanced, thoughtful and balanced portrait of that fateful night and resulting tragedy. The killers are living breathing men whose lives and personalities converge to create this crime -- a senseless tragedy that robs the world of two amazing, spirited young women. The author calls the book her ""personal memory stone"" to her cousins, and it's a beautiful, heartbreaking tribute."
870,1,Strange Twists,"This true account is well written, riviting, and perfectly clear. What happens to the young man is beyond understanding. Crime on top of crime is what comes to mind. But he survived to tell the story."
878,1,strangely wonderful,"If you've seen that strange and wonderful movie, The Triplets of Belleville, then you should order the soundtrack. If the triplet's song plays over and over in your head, then you need the cd, because not only is it there three times (twice in French and once in English), but the French Mafia' s theme shows you those horrid clones perfectly. If you've ever wanted a recording of music by a vacuum cleaner, a newspaper, a bicycle wheel and a refrigerator, this is the cd for you."
885,1,Happy with a Canon product again,This is a well made battery charger and very easy to use. No long cord with a plug. It plugs right into the electric socket. Handy to carry with you. I am happy with the Canon SD700IS digital camera and not surprised that any accessories would also merit a 5 star rating.
890,1,Excellent Concert By Excellent Artist!,"Janet is one of the best artists in music and she knows how to get a crowd going, even when it's home viewers with their DVD's. I saw Janet in concert as well and it's really this much fun. This is also a great DVD as well. Great motion menu's and animated chapter selection. Get the DVD now!"
895,1,The last Xbox book you will ever need!,This book describes how to do anything and everything you could ever want with an xbox.It starts of very simple by describing how to open up the xbox and take out the parts. But by the end of the book you will have covered such things as;-Installing Mod chips on all versions of xbox-Choosing the right dashboard-Learning the Xenium OS-FTP your computer and xbox-Flashing a bios and installing a dash board-Customizing your own dashboard-Replacing the case-Installing hard drives over 137GB's-Custom lighting-Xbox Media CenterThese are just a few of the many things that fascinated me about this book. A person who has never seen an xbox before could pick up this book and read it and have a completely pimped out xbox in a week.It is FULL of very detailed explanations and it has tons of very useful photographs.I would HIGHLY recommend this for ANY one who is going to open up their xbox.
903,1,Life Changing Memoir,"I was in my early twenties when this book found its way into my heart; I will never forget the sound of Sister Souljah's voice in my head, I could hear her words and feel the pain rising from the pages. Though it has been since the early nineties that I read No Disrespect, I will always heartily recommend Sister Souljah's grand debut; this book is pure heart; not easy to come by in these plastic times. I say, pick it up and give it a read, you won't be disappointed, and something might change within your soul, a new perspective, or even a song within your heart might be born and you might chance to sing along with No Disrespect ~ I think it takes guts to write like this, and this author has my full respect for putting herself out there. Not an easy thing to do. Sometimes its not easy to read a book chock full of opinions that one may or may not agree with; and that is the glorious thing about this book; new perspective, new horizons; freedom to think newly."
904,1,Simply Excellent,There aren't enough words to explain how much I enjoyed this book. Everyone should read this joint! I read it twice!
908,1,Excellent,"The Freddie Slack collection is especially well assembled. It's great to hear these tracks again, particularly his work with Margaret Whiting."
910,1,The Perfect Shower Gift!,"Soon after my baby shower our doctor ordered me on bed rest. She said I wouldn't be able to attend a regular lamaze class and recommended this DVD. Happily, my sister had just given it to us as a shower gift. It was a joy to watch and very informative."
923,1,Masterpiece.,"Excellent album, a masterpiece of this guys (and the shipping was absolutely great). A must in every music collection."
925,1,WOW!,This is an awesome CD. The title track will put you in a state of mind that makes other music become just noise.A truly talented man.
930,1,If you didn't already know...,"This whole series of books is magnificent. So unique, such a wonderful heroine. There are a lot of details in these books, and it's easy to get bogged down in them, but you just have to look at it as a learning experience. Other than that, this book is fantastic. Moving and inspiring. Could teach people today a thing or two about racism. The only thing I would caution is that I bought this to go with my set, which are the normal size for novels and this book is like a foot high. Not what I thought I was getting. But the text itself is fabulous!!"
933,1,I'm going nuts!,"PPLLEEAASSEE HURRY UP! I read this book when I was in grade 5, am now in grade 8 and have read it 5 times since then! Okay, so I'm a literiture junkie. I have read the whole series twice and have thought about the fifth book for so long that I think I could write it myself!"
938,1,The Cave Bear Series The Claln of the Cave Bear.,I had lost the original book that I had purchased so I chose this oneTo replace the first book of this Earth's Children Series. I love this book very much and reread it immediately. This soft cover volume is easier for my elderly fingers to handle while reading. This is a series that will never grow old and one that I will pass on to my grandchildren in the future.
942,1,"Fabulous book, couldn't put it down!","I loved this book, and I can't wait to buy The Valley of Horses. The way Ms. Auel could create such an intricate culture amazed me. Her writing techniques combined with a wonderful plotline make for an incredibly enjoyable book."
944,1,The Clan of the cave bears,"I read almost all of these books many, many years ago and found them so interesting - am loving The Clan again, and will probably order the entire set in time. So nice not to have the usual voilence, although the primitives were sometimes pretty rough, but in a more natural way! Just lovely night-time reading whilst the hubby snores!!! So good to have something to read in the dark."
946,1,Great. Really Great.,"I really liked this book, I have always been interested in early man, and I think this book sheds new light on the way it could of been back then. I found this book facinating, and I think that it was a wonderful experence.Although she didn't have any facts she still did a good job of filling in those empty spaces."
947,1,Very good,I rated that good because this book grabbed my attention inmediatly. Not only is intersting but also instructive. I recommends it to everybody. Regards.
948,1,Neato,"This is unlike my usual choice of reading, but I really enjoyed it. It contained a lot of interesting events and information that really stimulated my anger (such as the cruel treatment of Broud to Ayla). I disliked Broud and would have done everything in my power to annoy him if I were Ayla. i am disappointed that Ayla left her son behind with the clan, but he would have slowed her down. I reccomend this book for any avid reader that can handle long yet interesting books. Also, if I were a district official of a school, I would make it mandatory for prehistoric history students."
957,1,clan of the cave bear,"It will be difficult to keep once step ahead of ms aurels. I never gave any thought to people of this time in our history. But from the first paragra your mind carries you away to a new adventure, which gives promise to a long and happy union."
958,1,Amazing book,"Finished reading this last night. Amazing story!!! It was a bit difficult getting through the 1st chapter but after that, I was good to go! Totally imaginative, riveting, touching & pretty much leaves you with a kinda obsessive focus even when you're not reading. I loved the language; can't remember the last time I read a book that taught me SO many new words!!! & the story line? good grief....... I totally had NO idea the book was going to be that intense! or amazing! It's one of those moments where I realize & appreciate that you really cannot judge a book by it's cover/name. Some things you just MUST read! Auel is so descriptive and thorough in her writing. I'm so happy I came across this series... it realllllyyy makes you THINK and pulls on all your emotions. If you're reading this on your kindle, you will truly indulge in and love the dictionary! Every few pages I will hover my kindle cursor over a word and get the definition. Good stuff!"
967,1,Excellent Book,One of the best books I've read. It brought tears to my eyes especially at the end. Strong and touching it made me really think. The book is excellent to the very last word.
968,1,A Must-Read book and series,"I purchased this copy of ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" to help complete the set of ""Earth's Children"" books. My first reading of it was a library book. I loved the series and decided to own and reread them all. Jean Auel is amazing and I look forward to another book."
969,1,Excellent compilation on Leadershipattributes for innovation,Excellent compilation on Leadership attributes for innovation and is a collection of well written articles which made me think and connect to a real world phenomenon. I enjoy reading Peter Drucker's books and the content of the book has Peter Drucker's flavor to it. The Clarity and style of this book is truly outstanding.
970,1,Love My New Orleans Saints Floor Mats,"I am a New Orleans Saints fan and have been since the franchise began. I no longer live in New Orleans but I do still support the team. I wear Saints gear when they play and so does our dog. My entire family are die hard Saints fans. I fly my Saints flag on my car, so why not have the Saints floor mats. Every time I get in my car, I say ""geaux Saints!!!!"" The color is perfect for the interior of my vehicle. I would recommend the Saints floor mats to all Saints fans. I just wished there were mats for the rear."
973,1,Un libro importante,"Por favor, no te importa mi español pobre, pero en serio no soy hispanohablante. Cuando tuve trece años esto libro mi mejora amiga me dio, y imediamente fue enamorado con su idioma, tema, y jugadores en una historia complicada y intimo. ""Mas Que Humano"" es un libro de los mas importantes del siencias, y de los libros intelligentes."
974,1,Not your usual romance movie,"This movie has a wonderful and fully devloped story that reveals itself slowly during the first part of the film. It is filled with family drama, sexual tension, and one mans deep love for his family when he knows he is dying. Well worth the long movie time, and being dubbed in English (I am American and don't speak Danish). I am still thinking about it today, after watching it yesterday evening."
982,1,what hard rock is all about,"Cut the crap! it's motorhead, it's rock n' roll, loud, dirty, agressive, but also a singalong album.By far, my favourite Motorhead album, actually the only one that still survives in my collection nowadays.many eternal hard rock classics that must be listened by every metal, hard rock, stoner fan of the XXI century.check out Overkill, stay clean, no class, i'll be your sister, metropolis."
998,1,Exceptionally helpful to someone in their first year,"I found this book to be very comprehensive: addressing what MS is, what causes MS, symptoms of MS, diagnosis, symptom management, treatment options, and social aspects. It includes the technical description, but through the use of analogies, makes each description very tangible for the layperson. I found the section on medications (and their evolution) particularly helpful. This book reinforced much of what I've learned through doctors, websites, and support organizations and filled in the gaps where information was lacking. It's an excellent resource for someone who has been newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis."
1000,1,Maturity in his writing,After reading his earlyworks you can see how Chandler used his previous stories and ideas to develop these incredible novels featuring his most famous detective Philip Marlowe.
1001,1,New and Brilliant,"This film is exactly as it says on the box, ""A historic lock, stock and two smoking barrels""! I sat down to watch this film with an open mind as to wether I'd like it or not as it is different to anything i've ever watched before but as soon as the movie started I was mesmerised by the excellent acting, complex,yet easy to follow storyline and excellent soundtrack! Carlyle and Miller both never fail to (Stand and)deliverand Liv tyler as support is also excellent. If you like LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS you're bound to like this!"
1005,1,Old Time Favorite,This purchase was made as a replacement for a copy that was ruined when it got wet. Exactly what I wanted.
1006,1,Outstanding trilogy,"The notion of three different books by three different authors about the same story, each from a different character's perspective is new to me. I'd enjoyed the Diary series, and thought it was worth picking up the three books just to see how well the concept worked.I actually thought the books by the other two authors were better than this, but only by a small margin. They are all excellent, and reading the same story three different times never got boring because they are all so different, while remaining consistent.In many ways it's so true of life - we really don't know what's going on in other people's heads, especially when it comes to subterfuge and illicit behavior.Three different authors, three different characters, three different styles, one terrific story."
1008,1,Fantastic,I use this product to pickup chopped vegetables from my chopping board. I saw it used on a food show and I thought I would try it. I love it.
1010,1,Excellent addition to Holocaust Literature,Well written with a sense of humor about a very tragic period of time. I liked his style of writing with a story told from a different point of view.
1011,1,Ballet anyone?,"Franz von Suppe (German form of Francesco Ezechiele Ermenegildo Cavaliere Suppe-Demelli, which I like better) is known for his ballet music, but the CD series 1-6 contains even more wonderful music. All his music is very conducive to movement, whether ballet or other calisthenics (beauty and strength). Enjoyable when sitting still, too! He is a relative of Donizetti, so he had great musical examples to help him along (probably good genetics, too)."
1026,1,exactly as advertised,"The DVD arrived quickly and exactly as advertised. Plus, the pricing was better than retail. Thanks!"
1029,1,Wonderful Upgrade,"I have purchased this knife as an upgrade from a Farberware Pro Chef's Knife. Kershaw is a lot thinner, lighter, and infinitely sharper (buy some Band Aids). It has enough curve for a rocking low motion and long enough for high cutting technique. I love it.P.S. Still love it after half a year, recommend dulling the blade corner near the pummel, it will reduce number of little cuts with out sacrificing usability."
1033,1,My Favorite Book,"Enter a world where there is no past. Where the past is the present. Follow Winston as he thinks THOUGHT- CRIME, works on fake documents, and plots to shut down the system. Big Brother's eyes follow Winston Everywhere he goes. If you want to see wether Winston accomplishes his mission, you must read the book. After you read this book go check out the 1984 Movie. But don't see the Movie unless you've read the book or else you will have no idea what is going on in the movie."
1041,1,Perfect,This is such a great book! I ordered it on cassette so that I could listen to it on a long road trip and the product arrived right on time in great condition.
1047,1,This Book gives you Insight of Human Mind,This book tells us about how one person's Total thinking can be altered by means of a simple tool called Torture.
1054,1,Outstanding.,"This book is the most amazing, influential, disturbing, wonderful, and sickening, nightmarish, fantastic book I have ever read in my life.Don't read this review. Read the book. now, by whatever means."
1055,1,Chilling Book!!!!,"It is hard to belive that a totalitarian government can happen, People say it can't, but in truth it has. George Orwell's book has almost in a cense read the future. Take what happened in Stazi Germany, it is identical. And i belive that anyone who can guess at the future like that and be so right is deserving of some complement. And for the people out there who think that the readers of this book are all paranoied they are wrong. Read this book and then take a look around, how close are we really?"
1059,1,A Dictionary for 2003,"Doublethink and Newspeak need no explanation to people growing up with a Patriot Act that takes away liberties. We don't need the brilliant economic explanation that Orwell provides for the state of perpetual war with constantly changing enemies...But it's amazing how ""1984"" keeps popping up on enigmatic posters at recent antiwar rallies with references to doubleplusgood wars and war equalling peace and freedom equalling slavery. On February 15 in New York, I saw a young man holding a poster with the ultimate reference to this great cautionary novel: ""1 + 1 = 2"". If you don't know what that's referring to, please read this book today."
1060,1,Horrifyingly prophetic,"Orwell was dead-on in his vision of a possible future for the Western world. Indeed, according to recent events, Big Brother is HERE and voting Republican."
1063,1,"If you only read one more book, read 1984","If you only read one more book, read George Orwell's ""1984.""Other reviewers including the ... reviewer, has captured the essence of this incredible, disturbing, poignant, an accurate view into the mind of the totalitarians - and yes, folks, they live among us even today.I'll only add this: the ""book-within-a-book"" by Orwell's fictional author, Emmanual Goldstein, should be required study by every single high school and college student in the world. Don't know what I'm talking about? Read ""1984"" and look for Emmanual Goldstein within this book's pages. Then ask yourself the questions you dared not ask yourself before.Then go read ""Brave New World"" and ""The Probability Broach."" The first is a different, altogether more pleasant version of Hell. The second holds out the real promise of freedom-loving people (""Broach""). Then tell others what you have learned."
1065,1,the end is near!!! a ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!,"Just as high lord Orwell predicted, the world is at an apocalyptic state. Constant war, no privacy, thought police, the world is truly at its end. Though this lowly species has somehow managed to survive 15 years longer than lord Orwell predicted, surely this feeble race will extinguish itself because of its own greed and blind hatred. The contempt of the aristocrats has finally backfired as all knew it would. Creating ignorance and superficiality amongst the masses has finally gone too far, and there are no functional human beings left to survive. The contempt for nature and human ideals has led us to the brink of destruction, by our own hand."
1076,1,coverblend concealer,Product covers my black allery eye circles perfectly without drying the eye area; it stays until you wash it away.
1078,1,Don't you get it?,"What a brilliant movie about incest and how it leads to the devastation of a woman. A woman who can't feel anything, who is trying desperately in every way to feel...something. And when someone presents himself to draw her out of her withered self, all she can do is re-enact her adoloscent despair. Come on, folks -- her mother tells her she's filthy, she berates her for giving in to a man -- this is Psychology 101, but brilliantly acted and compelling. Of course, she wants her student to be damaged, because she is both jealous and trying to protect her student from her overbearing parents. I doubt that I'm going to sleep well tonight."
1081,1,"Like silky, velvet dreams","The moment I put this cd on and heard the light, lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sun-kissed Gregorian chants, followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat, I knew this was going to be one journey I'd be willing to take for many years to come...and that was the impression I got from the first track alone! Imagine what ensued... It only gets better from there!Every song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood, and while I find this exotically soothing debut album by Black Ether (an astonishingly overlooked group) extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles, I'd have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnic-world flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea."
1098,1,I really enjoyed this one!,"For grade levels 11th and up, Fahrenheit 451 is sure to please readers of all intrests. Fireman Guy Montag is deeply troubled when he meets a local girl and watchs a women burn in her home. He then realizes the importance of those books he keeps burning and within a few days, he is a totally diffrent person.Author Ray Bradbury predicts the future and successfuly holds the reader's intrest. Frightingly, Ray predictions are quite acurate. Read it and see for yourself."
1100,1,Breathtaking,"This book was the most breathtaking, jawdropping, and eyeopening phenomenon. I have read this book several times and every time I see something that I didn't see before and gain one more level in the battle against ignorance."
1108,1,My Favorite Book,"I love the writings of Ray Bradbury and this book tops them all.Although decades old, it's message is loud and clear. And I still think that the allegories and themes in this are still prevelant in today's society."
1111,1,A Perfect Quick Read,"A great story to pass the time during travel, such as on a plane or in car, because it should only take 2-and-a-half Hours to read. It starts with Guy Montag, a fireman whose job is to actually start fires, primarily to burn books and their owner's houses. After being encountered by a strange 17-year old girl who asks not only ""what"" things are about but ""why"", and witnessing a woman commit suicide by lighting her house (bearing books) on fire rather than let the Firemen do it themselves, he decides there must be something else to books than just words and paper. The story is about his struggles to revive the book world and save it from certain destruction."
1112,1,Thesis Statement For Fahrenheit 451,"Ray Bradbury in his classical novel Fahrenheit 451 uses symbolism, imagery, and literary devises to create an abhorrent world filled with censorship. In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury gives a frightening vision of the future where firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books. Bradbury paints society as holding happiness as there highest goal, where trivial, useless information is good and ideas and knowledge is bad. One of the most reoccurring literary devises in this novel is symbolism. We often see symbolism in the character's names. For example, one of the main characters, Guy Montag can have two translations. Guy signifies Guy Faux a famous man we associate with effigy, and Mischief Day (Nov.4), and Montag is the trademark of the Need American Paper Company, also a brand of furnaces. More symbolism is shown when we meet Faber. Faber is America's leading pencil company and it is going to be the pencil that writes on Montag's paper."
1126,1,Slick unit.,"Wish all chargers had coiled cords like this on has, stays out of the way. Very nice looking unit, well made and works great."
1129,1,Balrog!,"I am such a huge fan of author J.R.R. Tolkien's wonderful Lord of the Rings book trilogy and I must say that Fellowship of the Ring for the Game Boy Advance is a remarkable adaptation to Tolkien's book trilogy! But, beware of the glitches in this game! I got past them, but it wasn't easy. The game crashes in the Old Forest and the Mines of Moria levels. Other than that, this is a stunning game!"
1131,1,Great memories,My grandmother gave me this book when it was first published. I loved it then and I love it now. My grandmother lived in similar conditions and now I am too. Its a wonderful read. Full of laughter and smiles.
1132,1,Who says Old Folks don't have fun,"I just saw this book at a yard sale, the title caught my interest and I am not sorry I bought it. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my Daughter-in law's birthday"
1135,1,I agree...,"I know this isn't the most helpful review but I would justlike to concur with the other reviews. I have had these bootsfor a year now and except for a few scuffs, they still are ingreat condition."
1138,1,a real gem,"This is one of those rare romance books that just suck you in from the very beginning. There are actually two romances in one in this book. I actually found the secondary romance as good as the main one and that is not easy to find in a book. Usually you find yourself skipping over the second relationship because the first one is so much better.Actually, I think this book would adapt well as a movie. There were enough humorous parts to rival any of today's romantic comedies.If you haven't read this one, you're missing out. I'd give it 10 stars instead of the 5 allowed."
1145,1,Excellent British Movies,This set of 8 movies are top notch entertainmentyou will enjoy some great stories with excellent actingso do your self a favor and order this set of movieschfancierFancier of fine movies
1147,1,Movie,"It was brand new as stated and received very quickly. I love BBC and historical pieces. This is a good one, especially for this price."
1149,1,Great performances!!,"A very interesting compilation of wonderful performances, from several heavy duties of the prog rock scene in the 90s. The progfest was an amazing opportunity of enjoy our well beloved bands, old and new! The John Wetton Band is at its best in this concert, and also are specially inspired the intervention of Spock's Beard and Arena. The Flower Kings is always a great presence, and watching Le Orme after so many years, was a wonderful surprise.Thanks to the progfest! To have the video is at least a good consolation for all of us who were not able to be there. Only problem is that you want to watch more of the performances!!"
1153,1,Don't write a review until you read this and waited...,"Don't write a review until you read this and waited.Finnegans Wake takes time to penetrate the mind.At first, it makes no sense. But keep trying, and try, and try...and then you will get its awesomeness."
1163,1,outstanding...,"Im ussualy into something much more brutal & insane & gore then the likes of hatebreed but i can't deny tha fact that i enjoy their music alot! I seen this guys at ozzfest & i did enjoy their performance alot & i just like how their music attracts all kinds of people...Some how that makes me like them even more! I quess that's hatebreed for you! Okay, hatebreed's new album ""rise of brutaly"" as well as the one before that ""perseverance"" are also pretty amazing in itslef...Support hatebreed!PS: I hate the fact that they put slipknot in the same category as hatebreed...F*ck slipknot--they suckkk!!!!!!! Only posers listing to slipknot,f*ck 'em!"
1176,1,"If you liked StarGate at all, you'll want to see Continuum. GREAT movie.","I hope they keep making these direct-to-DVD Stargate films. The TV show was outstanding and I loved all ten seasons. The previous ""Ark of Truth"" direct-to-DVD movie was terrific and this one maintains the high production quality, storyline and acting.Somehow, they managed to get practically all of the actors portraying the various heros and villians over the years back together for the story. For example, there are lots of cameos by all the best ""System Lords"" we loved to hate in the TV show.If you're a Stargate fan, you won't want to miss this.My only regret is that I just bought the DVD last week for $15 at Best Buy when I could've rented it here for $3.99, but at least the DVD includes a few hours of bonus material about the production.Two Kentucky thumbs up to the Stargate cast and crew!"
1182,1,Excellent indeed !,"When I saw it first time I was under the impression that I was looking at some Oscar prize movie so I had to seen it once more just after ending... Sometime after first 25-30 minutes of the second view I realize that is on DVD... so no Oscar, too bad. It's better than the ""ARK"", better than ""Children of the Gods"" sometimes better than first one ""Stargate"" (Kurt Russel). Rick is great again, as usual... What can I say, it's not only for Stargate fans, it's for anyone and anything...It's just great. And I guess right now O'Neill asked ... what?!"
1184,1,None stop action with a twist,"From the opening scene, until you realize the movie is already over, this is a great film. Very well done, and worthy of having in a collection for Stargate SG1 junkies!"
1185,1,Miss the series,"I was very upset when they took this series off the air. I'm glad to have these movies but still wish the series was still around, Love this movie."
1189,1,great item,"SG1 Continuum, is a great movie. The CGI is flawless and over all a great movie. I hope it isn't the last MGM does."
1194,1,I like it,"Before your first time of cooking, you have to hold the rice cook in your chest and wash the inside of the lid under hot water from the tap. I didn't do that until my third time cooking. The first two were terrible with my cooked rice filled with awful plastic smell. After I washed the lid with flowing hot water from the tap, I don't get any plastic smell in my rice any more. The manual should have that instruction. Also I tried to cook my porriage with the lid shut, it is also OK. So far I'm satisfied with it. If it has timing, it would be perfect."
1199,1,Incredible,"A great movie, fast, moving, totally capturing. It makes you think, it makes you dance, it makes your heart beat faster, and most important of all it makes you realize how important ""a second"" of lifetime can be and how it can change everything."
1200,1,German ground hog day.,"A well done ground hog day type movie. A very well done movie, that keeps up the interest all the way through."
1212,1,SEHR GUT,"I really liked this movie. Visually, it is a very beautiful movie. The characters, even the minor ones, are intriguing. The plot is exciting and revolutionary. And finally, the soundtrack is wicked awesome.Franka Potente is an amazing actress,there is more evidence of this in the Bourne Identity. She has lots of charisma and pulls you into the movie. Manni actually wasn't too bad. He and Lola are both pretty weird people so its ok.Applause to the Germans, you've come up with a really good one here! Sehr gut!"
1213,1,"A cross between ""Sliding Doors"" and ""Pulp Fiction""","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It was so fast-paced and interesting. Oh my god, you absolutely have to see it!!!"
1222,1,The best and most essential Shepard collection,"This collection features his finest and most mature work (Buried Child, Curse, True West) plus the best of his earlier plays (La Turista, The Tooth of Crime). They all showcase his great humor and startling use of language and imagery. Th more mature works deal, unflinchingly with american families. Tongues and Savage Love, which he did in collaboration with Joseph Chaiken, are wonderful, poetic meditations of existence and identity. If you are interested in Shepard as a playwright this is the finest collection of his best work. After this, I recommend seeking out the plays Fool for Love and A Lie of the Mind, for more of his ""mature"" work and then also Angel City as another prime example of the imaginative flights he took with his earlier work. In case you don't already know, Shepard is one of the most important American playwrights. Period."
1229,1,Great tea in a really nice presentation.,"Bentleys has some of the best teas out there. This box makes a great gift for tea lovers. It has a great variety of green teas (papaya, pomegranate, blueberry, etc.) and each comes individually bagged for freshness. Just steep and enjoy!"
1242,1,Great service,Truly love the writing of Joseph Girzone the series of Joshua books. You get so wrapped up in them you don't want to put them down. Great service; had in less than a week. Thanks!
1254,1,Great Piedmont Blues,This is a great dvd if you like acoustic blues. The camera work is great and the tunes are classic.
1259,1,Likable music that you enjoy as much as the kids do!,"We bought this disc after seeing Ralph Covert open for the kid's band ""Hi-5"". The kids love these songs. The adults in the house love the ""Big Rig"" song and the ""Coffee"" song just as much as the kids do. I can respect a song that hits that close to home: ""and tonight I think I'll have a little vino"".Buy this disc for your kids, but you can enjoy it, too."
1264,1,Excellent follow up to Big Game Hunter,"I played Cabela's Big game hunter ultimate challenge, and enjoyed it very much. I immediately bought this as soon as it came out. The graphics are even better than Big game hunter, there are tracks behind the vehicles, everything has shadows, and the hunter even leaves footprints behind. The new 'deer finder' arrow is a very cool new feature and gives the game a more arcadey feel. The mission based play of this game is very cool, and the range of levels and deer are just right. The models for the hunters are improved also. Lots of great gadgets and hunting gear are available to the player including a 'predator' style heat vision and a night vision scope ! All in all a lot of fun. A little easiser than BGH but BGH was kinda hard. You can change the difficulty to suit yourself. I am so glad that activision are supporting the genre on consoles !"
1265,1,Excellent Service,"The book was in excellent condition you can't even tell that it's been used. Also, it came very fast. Excellent Service and reliability! I would definantely purchase from this person again in the future!"
1267,1,VERY HELPFUL,"THIS BOOK WILL HELP PREPARE YOU FOR THE MILITARY ASVAB TESTS. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AND IT WAS HELPFUL TO MY TEENAGE BOYS,"
1269,1,Awesome Reviewer,"This book is easy reading. My daughter used this to review for her ASVAB exams - and yes, she passed with flying colors. Hightly recommended."
1281,1,Please re-release the DVD already!,"Needless to say, I love this movie (and Jean de Florette.) I would just like to say that if anyone has bought the rights to it (Criterion?), kindly release it already, since these movies have been out of print for years now. Available used from $90. Get outta here."
1288,1,A mirage of life,"One Hunderd Years of Solitude left me disturbed.From the happy tale of two young lovers, who carveout a new village for themselves, to the incestousaccount of the last descendants of the family,the book has the power to unnerve the reader. Thestory rambles, so that you feel that time issuspended in Mocando. And yet as charactersgrow older, you notice that time is in fact movingin a circle. The same members of the family are reborn in theArcadia family, reincarnated as the 100 years passby. The forces compelling them to act as theydo, attract and repel you at the same time. Youtry and understand the events and thecharacters, but sheer incredulity and awe asthe story unfolds, leaves you stupefied. I amnot sure I love the book like I do ""Jane Eyre""or admire it like I do ""War and Peace"".But I am powerfully attracted by it, and I'd like toread it again - if only to marvel at a magicalfamily, banished to one hunderd years of solitude.<BR"
1289,1,Deeply moving and extremely interesting,"Recently in my college English class we were discussing books that we read in high school. My professor asked us to list the ones that we hated on the board and someone listed ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"". Many people agreed with her, but I must say I do not. I absolutely loved this book! I actually was not required to read it in high school, I was learning Spanish at the time and was looking for a book with elements of Spanish culture. It is long, and drawn out, and confusing and that is what makes it amazing. After finishing it I felt like I had lived it instead of reading it. I highly recommend it. If you are required to read this book in school give it a chance before you toss it aside because it is long, or it looks boring. It takes some time in the beginning to get into it but once you do, if you go into it with an open mind, you will not regret it."
1292,1,Perfection,"This is by far, the best novel i have ever read in my whole 29 years . . . I was dreaming through the pages of this epic story of 7 generations , , wonderful by all means."
1294,1,One of the greatest I have ever read,"This book makes me want to learn Spanish so I can read it in Marquez's original language.This story is an epic of a kind you've never read. No heroes, no great voyage - just a family and their town. It's a kind of Book of Genesis for the Buendia family, a family that you will know intimately by the end of the novel as if it's your own.Marquez skillfully blends the tangible realities of hard life with supernatural interludes that help make this book one of the most beautifully poetic that I've ever read. It's the kind of book that when you finish - incidentally having one of the most perfect endings put to paper - you will sit back and think about it for a while. You will walk the hallways of the Buendia house long after you finish this book and swear that you've known the many people that lived and died there. And you will miss them.This book is a masterpiece. Put this first on your list."
1297,1,You will be amazed,"This is one of those books that you will make all of your friends read once you have experienced its magic. It will take your through a hundred years of deaths, births, tragedies, and joys of a cursed family. And the best part is the ending - a conclusion that will leave you breathless!"
1301,1,A Very Important Novel,"One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read ( and I have read thousands).Marquez is a giant. His skill is like that of a mythical creature, like a Phoenix combined with a hundred great authors.The pure fact that this book was written by one man is amazing. I don't want to say anything about the story. If you care about great literature, do not let life pass by without reading Marquez' masterpiece."
1306,1,Magical Realism at its best,"I guess that is where this book is usually categorized in. Apparently, Gabriel Garcia Marquez popularized the genre. I loved the book and would put it in the top five of my list. There are people who I've talked to that thinks it was confusing or complicated. That was not the case for me. It's true that there were many characters (and it does not help that a lot of them are named similarly). But, I think each of them is distinct and was developed very well. The book is not about the town of Macondo...it's about the people who lived there. And, you will be able to relate to the book because of its very human characters set in an environment that is often very real but occasionally eerily surreal. That's magical realism for you."
1307,1,The best book ever,"One Hundred .... was the first book by García Marquez I read, since then I have read all his work, but I will never be so impressed by a book as I was with this one, the moment I finished it, I began again. The last pages got me so much that I kept doing as Aureliano was doing at the moment, trying to skip some bits to reach the end and find out what was the mistery of the book. Is a masterpice that everyone should read at least three times. It might not be the most beautiful one I've ever read, that is for sure ' Love in the times of cholera', but it is, for sure, the most powerfull."
1312,1,Keep trying to read this if at first you put it down,"My first couple of tries at reading this book didn't go very far. I never made it beyond the first chapter. Then on a visit to Colombia I was determined to read this book. I kept at it. Before long I was totally absorbed into the story, which is truly fascinating and amazing. Now I don't know why I could not get into it on my earlier attempts. I'm so glad that I persisted. So, the book that I originally couldn't get into, finally became one of my favorite novels."
1314,1,Magical and All Encompassing,"A few writers in each generation are gifted with such writing talent that they create books that make you catch your breath. Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of those writers. His gift with prose, the way he uses language, his storytelling ability is staggering. This is an engrossing read from the very first sentence. You will be captivated by the magical world that has been created and the all too human characters that populate the story.For reading pleasure, I would recommend the Harper Perennial Modern Classics edition of this book, which has those very convenient flaps on the front and back covers that make perfect bookmarks to save your page when you do manage to put the book down!"
1321,1,"OmniMount UCL-LP Single Arm Cantilever Mount (fits 32""- 45"" flat panels)","I wanted to locate my flat panel in a difficult location. Seeing this item gave me hope that I could finally accomplish this. Although quite expensive, the price seemed reasonable compared to what was available in local stores and their even higher prices.My unit I own a 46"" flat panel, but decided to take a chance that this item would be adequate. Ordered the item and waited with baited breath. Without any inquiry or such, the mount arrived promptly as advertised. Much to my surprise, the company and up sized my order, I can only assume because of availability, to the next size.It was constructed well beyond my expectations and installed easily. The flat panel is in its new location and given me much more flexiblity with the arranging of my living room.By the way, I don't have any doubt that if they had sent exactly the item I'd order that is would have worked out just as well also."
1324,1,Power & assasination,"Assassins, attractive werewolves, smelly talking mongrel dogs ... whats not to love!For personal reasons i can relate to Sam Vines & his continuing evolution is wonderful to watch.Now if he can just obey orders for once ... or maybe that's just not Sam."
1336,1,Magnificent,"This movie is excellent on its own, but absolutely extraordinary when paired with its sequel, Manon of the Spring. I highly reccomend the two as a pair to anyone considering either."
1338,1,A must-see movie,"Truly, this is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is a realistic story that has made it possible for me to see how one thinks and how one acts in life, and how everything has its reason in the end. Highly recommended movie, Cheers, Branko Miros"
1340,1,Enlightening and spell binding,"I read Titanic in the early part of 1997. I found the book fascinating, especially to one who knew very little of the disaster and the uncovering of the broken ship. I have recommended the book as a must read to many of my friends. Skip the movie and read the book!"
1345,1,Love it,"I love this movie, we had it on VHS and then our VHS player died so had to replace it with this. Works great."
1349,1,Nice show (Recommended),"The strengths of this DVD are : 1) A nice storyline which shows how a country girl tries to survive in NY. 2) Nice music eg. Can't fight the moonlight, etc. throughout the show. 3) Girl-Appeal esp. the innocence of Piper Perabo and the sensuality of the coyotes. 4) Romance with a nice ending :) 5) various commentaries on the movie 6) music video of 'can't fight the moonlight'"
1355,1,Sometimes an album just clicks,"It sounds right, is the best way to say this. Sometimes an album just clicks, tracks in order, everything moving smoothly together. Such is the sound of VERSION 2.0, a big, liquid album with a song for every mood. Here is a group that enjoys playing together -- see them in concert; they have a good time -- and they spend the album playing with us, doing bleak, doing frantic, doing downright catty. Showing off? They have a right to. This is very good stuff."
1361,1,Perfect! Well written!,"I saw Garbage in concert at The Night 89x Stole X-Mas in Detroit, and they were by far the best group there. This album is excellent. A definate buy!"
1366,1,A great album,"There is no competition...this is my undisputed, absolute favorite CD (since the last release from Garbage). Version 2.0 is addicting, from the lively (and occasionally erratic)techno beats to Shirley Manson's breathy, seductive verbal catharsis (laser recodred for our enjoyment!), it leaves you yearning for more. This CD takes a person on a sort of emotional roller coaster. From ""Temptation Waits"", a celebration of dependance and obsession to ""You look so fine"" a melancholy longing for ""ever after"" (i.e. riding of into sun sets and such...) It's a trip and I fully endorse it (regardless of my insignificance). BUY IT ALREADY!"
1368,1,You gotta love garbage,"After missing theirr recent Toronto concert at the phoenix (sold out in 20 minutes!), and reading reviews, I had to buy this CD. So I did... I liked the first album but I LOVE version 2.0. Everything from the clever Album title to the amazing mix of wonderful songs made me fall in love with garbage for real!!!If you're at all unsure about garbage, just buy this CD and see what happens.... But don't forget to get your concert tickets as soon as they go on sale!"
1373,1,Undoubtedly THE BEST Garbage Album thus far!,"This is a great album by Garbage! I love the modern and hip beat of ""Special."""
1376,1,Amazing CD,"I had just heard a little bit of the song ""Push It"" and I had to run out and buy the CD, the CD has so much into it that now anything that Garbage has out, I have to find and listen to it. I especially like the song, ""The trick is to keep breathing"" Shirley Manson's voice is amazing, I can't think of any other way to put it. I recomment this CD totally."
1385,1,Very pleased,No problems with order! Received item within time frame. Haven't played the DVDs yet but they are new in packaging so any problems with DVD would not be seller fault.
1390,1,Julia,"A wistful, compelling story about the power of female bonds and friendship. Fonda has never been better, Redgrave is luminous as the idealistic Julia, and Jason Robards conveys a worn assuredness as Hellman's husband, writer Dashiell Hammett. Zinnemann's handling of period detail in 1930s New York and Berlin is exquisite, and the film rightfully earned 11 Oscar nominations. A personal favorite."
1395,1,"great book, hopefully wont need it",I bought this book more for a just in case kind of need. I am not filing bankruptcy but if I ever need to then the book contains all the helpful information that someone would need. It has great examples and definitions.
1397,1,Excellent fantsy,My first Piers Anthony book. I can hardly wait for each of the Xanth books to appear.Best fantsy writer.
1398,1,An unbiased history,One of the best books you will find on the Army Air Force prior to and during World War II. This is one of the few authors that doesn't impose his opinions on the reader. He goes out of his way to give both sides of an issue or a personality. Even such controversial figures as Britain's Bernard Montgomery or our own Douglas MacArthur are treated with an even-handedness that is all too rare. Very entertaining and very informative.
1401,1,Highly recommend :),"I love this book because it allowed me to see just how much I have been limiting myself. I enjoyed learning the techniques to achieving your visualizations. The author makes valid points and talked about many specific subjects that I have been questioning recently and even experiencing, so that has helped me directly address the issues. Overall, I'd hiiighly recommend"
1402,1,Thank you for this book,"Just received this book today 11/23/11, will get to reading it over the holiday, since school is closed and I need something interesting to read. The notes in the book will help me to decide on new ideas for the coming year. Thanks."
1405,1,Kylie returns,"Years after her hit in the US (and with a steadily growing career in Europe and else where in the world) Kylie Minogue returns to the airwaves with a dance hit that is catchy and hypnotic. At first I was only slightly interested in this tune but the more I heard it, the more I like it. I'm looking foward to the entire cd and I hope it is filled with great dance songs like this one."
1406,1,It's Never Too Late to Review This Single.,"As someone who's been following Kylie since her late 1980s, Stock Aitken Waterman years, I was one happy camper when I learned that ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" blasted into the US Top Ten. After a disastrous cover of ""The Locomotion,"" Kylie quickly disappeared from the American spotlight while she attained superstardom in the UK. Over the years, she tried to win American audiences back, but with no such luck. Then, years later, came this single, a hypnotic slice of disco minimalism with its undeniable ""la la la"" hook. Having topped the charts in the UK and in a few other countries, it was poised for similar success stateside. After a long absence, we Americans should be so lucky that we have Kylie back ruling the charts again. ""I Can't Get You Out Of My Head"" is one of the best and most memorable singles of this, or any other, year."
1409,1,Putting in transforming action,"The book is an inspiring, practical Biblically-based manual for moving fromcharity to transformation of community. It is enriched by practical examplesfrom real life experiences in low income communities and working with people with soundtheological underpinnings. It is inspiring;one feels hopeful and notdependent on experts, but that transformation, step by step, can happenwith committed people inspired by hope and small first successes. A mustbook for people working in low income communities, especially with faithconnections."
1410,1,Great for young kids,"I love this game! I bought one 15 or so years ago when my son was young, good first game as it helps teach turn taking. Little kids love it when the crocodile ""bites"" you! Even timid kids get into the game after an adult gets bitten a few times. Bonus that it's portable, no loose pieces, I purchased this one for my niece's three sons (under the age of 5) and have given it as a gift over and over, really fun game."
1411,1,Children Love Crocodile Dentist !,"I bought this for my three children and they all loved it, it was well used for years. It was still in good shape after years of use so I put it in storage. I came across it, and I thought the students I teach might like it. I teach middle school. I put this on my desk and the students race to be the first in the class to play. They loved it so much, I went on Amazon and bought more! I have 5 on my desk, they are used daily by 100's of students, they are dropped almost daily. Students are not late to class. Students do not get tired of this quick fun and durable game. You should purchase this, it is perfect for on top of a desk, kids of every age love it!"
1416,1,Great show,If you know this show that is probably why you are here and don't need me to tell you how good it is. If you are new then buy it! It is fun and never slows down. Unfortunately there is only one season.
1421,1,Love it!,I recently ordered the Chamae Rose 2oz bottle and receivd it promptly.Item as described and I will absolutely purchase again!
1431,1,excellent readable fun,"Martin Deporres Kennedy has a fine gift for storytelling. He pulls you into the story. I read this through in one sitting. The story is a vehicle for introducing theological ideas, often through debates between characters. These debates are very realistic, and may reflect actual arguments that the author haard or participated in. I would strongly recommend this for students. It would be a wonderful thing for Catholic high school religion teachers to assign their class."
1435,1,What a gorgeous watch!!! (for $65),"I have been looking for a new dress watch for a month. (I am kind of a fussy person). I saw this watch and read the reviews . It made me considered about buying it. I decided to buy this one. I've got it today. I thought of two words on my mind. (everytime when I bought stuff online) ""Satisfied"" or ""Disappointed"". After I opened the package. I smiled all day long.Nice watch!!! Good price.!A few things want to mention you all, The watch is a little bit smaller than I expected (But it's not a promblem because my wrist it's so small(6"").it fits me perfectly)Don't be panic about the watch doesn't work at the first time. You have to let it charges for a while.(Good function,though! you don't need to worry about changing baterries)I love the lobster claw-clasp because I can adjust it myself. (I always got a problem about paying extra for adjusting the band)Well..I'd recommend this watch to anybody. Buy for yourself or as a gift. You will be happy anyway.Love it!!"
1436,1,"great price, perfect product","I have a tendency to burn out watch batteries, so this watch is perfect for me. No more replacing batteries every 3 to 6 months. Plus as a woman with a larger wrist I have a terrible time finding a feminine looking watch that fits me. This one I have plenty of room and it looks great."
1437,1,5 to the 10th Power In Stars,"They should really raise the star point system here, because anything by Mosby is worth the buy. I have the Mosby's Medical Dictionary for Nursing and Allied Health Professionals, and when I saw this book in the store, I was trying to figure out the difference, because of the color. This one offers just as many details as my previous book. This is important, because it is an easy read, and it is necessary for each household to have, for children to study off of, to the housewife that just wants to be informed. Mosby has been following me through nursing school, and anything they sell as a study aide will have a place in my home."
1446,1,we are witnesses,"We are witnesses by Jacob Boas, is a GREAT book to read it gives you different views of teenagers that went through diffuculty during the holocaust. As you know, the person who was in charge of the holocaust was Hitler. All the teeangers talked about hope they always had the hope to live and to have their own family. They never talked about hate, they never said they hate hitler the only thing that they said was that he was responsible for what was happening. This was shocking to me because I would hate the person who had my family killed. Wouldn't you?"
1447,1,Caught the fever!,"I was introduced to this band by some friends. Not only are their covers better than some of the original recordings but Brian's love songs are amazing. Give a listen this cd, specifically I'm Gonna Stay and the title track, The Great Symphony."
1448,1,Inspiration & Motivation,"Right into the book one of the authors (Norean) talks about the necessity of getting out of our own way in the battle to lose weight. She had my attention from that moment on. Most of us know how to lose weight, it's our attitudes that need adjusting. This book is easy to read, with helpful information on every page. I read it with a Magic Marker in my hand, marking passages to read again. It was pretty well marked up by the time I finished the book. AND, it's got to be the FIRST weight loss book I've ever read cover to cover. I highly recommend it. It's written with compassion."
1450,1,AWESOME MOVIE A MUST SEE,I Loved this Movie Plain And Simple It is A MUST SEE. Zoey Saldana has a huge impact in this film. I have multiple copies of this film in my home some how lol but it is well worth it. A must see buy it. Pop some popcorn and enjoy :)
1452,1,Husband LOVES this magazine!,"I got this subscription as a gift for my husband. He loves it. He's really into staying fit and taking care of himself, like many other 20-30 year olds. And this magazine does a great job of writing about topics that are important to young male readers. A great buy. :)"
1453,1,Terrific new artist,"Merche (Mercedes Trujillo Callealta) is one of a number of fresh, young Spanish artists. As I understand it, she gave up a career in education to concentrate on music. As far as I am concerned it was a great decision. Her first album, on which she not only sings but also wrote most of the words and music, is a combination of great dance rhythms and a few excellent ballads. She has a strong, beautiful voice, and it is no wonder that her intitial foray into the music world has been a big hit in her native country. Personally, since I received this CD, I have listened to it again and again, and have not even begun to tire of it. Highly recommended!"
1459,1,Word Biblical Commentary - Genesis,"Gordon Wenham has produced a first-class exegetical commentary of Genesis. The bibliographies cover a full range of topics and authors. For each section of the biblical text, he begins with textual notes which are quite valuable to those familiar with the ancient languages. Next he addresses issues of form and structure. Finally, he provides a verse-by-verse commentary. In the process, he addresses various approaches and viewpoints in an even-handed and fair way."
1460,1,This book should be on our shelves as Pastors,"I cannot imagine a less user-friendly layout than the Word Biblical Commentary Series. The series is uneven, and occasionally goes overboard in literary/source criticism. But one up-to-date, critical commentary on Genesis should be on our shelves, and this is about the best."
1473,1,My Name Is Buddy CD,Adorable songs about Buddy the cat who goes on a trip with just hissuitcase. Great old songs. Kind of jazzy with blues undertones. Thestories of Buddy's journey are timely. Very enjoyable for people wholove Cats and jazz & blues. Love it!Linda
1478,1,great stuff,These are just the beat scrubbies I'ver used. They don't scratch and they last forever. None of my local stores carry them anymore.
1487,1,Outstanding performancw,"I'd like to see this on stage, this performance certainly enhanced my interest in this work."
1489,1,Great product,This kit has everything you would ever need to repair a pair of glasses from screws to nose padsI received the kit real fast in about 3 days I was surprised at how many screws there were the screwdriver is easy to use and the nose pads so many this was better then described on amazon store page
1492,1,Why pay more?,"I actually purchased a pair of these about a year ago for my home WIFI network from a different site. Since that site no longer has these in stock, I got the next pair (this time for my church) from Amazon. I have had 0 issues with these cards - can't remember a single time where I lost connectivity honestly. Don't think I could ask for more, especially at the price point. Great buy!"
1493,1,Super G 802.11BG Wireless Pci 64 Bit Xp Compliant Turbo Mode,"I ordered this just over a month ago, and I recieved it in the time frame that I was told. It is great! My computer works great with it and it was really easy to install! I have never installed one before, but I wanted to try and do it myself and not have to get someone else to do it! It was so easy to do and once installed, I downloaded the disk and it was ready to go...it was really quite simple,and I am far from a computer expert. So if I can do it, so can you! I'm so glad I got it and I will probably be purchasing a couple more in the near future for my kids' computers too!!"
1494,1,Installed on 2 desktops - Easy as pie,"I wanted to get rid of those pesky wires, so after some research I bought one of these to see if it would work in my desktop. The day it arrived I followed the directions and it was picking up my wireless router signal within 5 minutes of opening the package. Needless to say, I bought another one the same day for my wife's desktop and they have worked flawlessly for a month now. Both are XP systems."
1498,1,Super G 802.11BG worked out of box,"I installed the Super G 801.11BG wireless card into an older Dell desktop with 2 OS's on separate hard drives. One OS is ubuntu and the other is XP.With the ubuntu OS,the card worked out of the box without any more tweaking,with the XP OS,I installed the software that came with the card,and it worked without any more tweaking, and still works with ubuntu after upgrading from 8.10 to 9.04.Highly recommend this wireless card and I really like the antenna being on a cable instead of attached to the card on the back of computer."
1507,1,The Best Sherlock Holmes -- And That's Saying Plenty!,"I have read and enjoyed many a good Sherlock Holmes story (e.g. ""The Red-Headed League"" is a winner), but at the very top of the book stack I would place ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"". Who could ever forget the atmosphere that Arthur Conan Doyle evokes by his use of those misty moors!In teaching English (Literature) to a class of 7th & 8th grade boys, I was at first a bit hesitant to introduce this novel as our text. Would a group of squirrelly junior high boys find anything of interest in a book written in 1901? Answer: I needn't have worried. They loved it (and so did I)! The fog from the moors drifted right into our classroom.First-rate mystery tale with one of the most famous fictional characters ever created. ENJOY! (But keep an eye out for a frightful luminescent hound next time you're walking home at night - just in case)."
1509,1,Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would approve,"I'm new to audio books. But, I'm afraid I've already been spoiled. I wonder if there could possibly exist a better combination of author and reader. Holmes sounds just the way you'd expect the great sleuth to sound. Deliberate, never rushed and always a gentleman.The story is carefully woven and the presentation of the characters by Timson is masterful. I've listened to it over several times and each time I appreciate a little more the complexity and the detail. The Musical interludes are brief and sparse, but definitely compliment. If you like Sherlock Holmes, Timson is the right reader for the job. I'm buying the big collection now."
1511,1,Enhanced with music and sound effects,"The first in Scenario Productions' ""The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes"" series and taken from the Archives of CBC Radio, this superbly presented radio adventure theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is a multicast presentation of a classic Sherlock Holmes story. This two audio cassette audio book has a two hour running time and is enhanced with music and sound effects for the perfect ""theater of the mind"" listening experience. This radio theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is enthusiastically recommended for all Sherlock Holmes fans and would make a very popular addition to school and community library audio book collections."
1513,1,This book is awesome!,"I read this book and this is definitely my favorite of all the books I have read. This book is very, very, suspenseful and a little spooky. This was the first Sherlock Holmes book I have read and it got me hooked on Sherlock Holmes. I couldn't put this book down because it was so suspenseful and it was very entertaining. I would recommend this book to anyone."
1533,1,Prompt and Utter Distruction,"My opinion about this book is it joins a long list of similar books that pick out parts of the decisions that were made in 1945 about use of the atomic bomb and criticize U.S. leaders who made decisions under the press of time and circumstance and in dealing with a Japanese military, which totally ran the country. In such a situation, someone like the author of this book (and there are many others like him) can go back and question the decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan from the safe distance of more than 50 years. In my review of the handling of the atomic bomb in August, 1945, with very minor exceptions, the leaders of the United States made the correct decision based on all the facts.uwcharlie"
1536,1,Hardcore Fun for The Entire Family,"If you enjoy movies that make you uneasy yet you keep watching because of a voyeueristic mix of repulsion and fascination, then look no further--here's the one you've been looking for.Brando was considered a legend, and this movie is proof; ""acting"" is too small a word to describe the performance he gave here.Pain. Confusion. Lust. Grasping at redemption as it slithers through your fingers--it's all right here, folks.This movie is a carousel of torment. There's an anonymous person riding next to you, and both of you have to laugh at it all, just to keep from crying."
1538,1,"to paraphrase Inigo Montoyo and Freud, sometimes a camel hair coat ""[doesn't mean] what you think it means""","Ohmijesus, arriviste in Paris lets go of one branch to grab onto what she thinks is an established man of importance. Brando who raped faerie queen Vivien Leigh in A Streetcar Named Desire has his bereaved, many-varied way with badly cloaked Toxic Ambition. This is why men break up over the telephone or via email or better yet just VANISH. This is a precursor to Fatal Attraction. I think this movie is supposed to be annoying, off-putting and unattractive. His dead wife is the daughter of a French Resistence member. Could this be important to the movie?"
1540,1,Don't buy the wrong one!,"This review is not about the product -- Everyman Tragedies Volume 2, which is wonderful -- but a warning to use care when purchasing. My first time through, I clicked into the ""New"" options from $0.73, and was directed to several well priced books. The only problem is, they are not the volume advertised on this page. Instead it's three plays in an unattractive volume from something called Ann Arbor Media. So be careful!"
1549,1,EUEKA BITTERROOT 11,"I just got this to replace a little 2 people tent as my daughter is old enough now to go camping whit us. Yes It is very roomy for the three of us but I can for sure use the extra space. We camp at a lagoon 35F at night to 55F at noon. No condensation, good wind protection and resistance. Very well constructed. You will need help to put on the canopy on windy situations. It's a very good option between a 3 seasons and a 2 seasons because of the protection and waterproof and the big windows and height."
1550,1,Euphoric About Eureka Bitterroot Tent,"We have owned this tent for seven months now and can attest that the manufacturer description and majority of other reviews are spot on (thus far)! While we have yet to put it through any rough weather tests, we have found the tent to possess a practical design, spacious interior, a height that makes it comfortable for standing, well made, and easy to put up and take down. The only suggestion I would have for Eureka is to include metal tent stakes instead of the cheap easily breakable plastic ones."
1563,1,GREAT !!,"This is a great movie !I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this, but I'm very glad I took a chance on it. It has beautiful scenery, good actors and it's really quite scary ! Iv'e been in a cave before and went much farther into it than expected for a guy who doesn't like confined spaces. This movie captures the feel and fear involved in exploring the underground. If I ever do go into another one, I will be watching for the freaky creatures that live within the caves of this movie. These guys(or gals)natually freak me out! The way they look, move, and sound are great. There is plenty of suspense and alot of scary scenes.I was a little ""put-off"" by the ending,which I guess is the prelude to ""Decent II"", which I haven't seen yet. Over all, it's worth renting, or buying. It's a classic !!"
1566,1,Best little printer ever!!!,"Would not sell for 300 even though bought for 80 because this printer is amazing! I have used for maybe 3 years and only replaced the ink cartridge once and print all the time. Quality Prints, Quiet and Nearly Instant prints. What else could you want?IFind one of these. You won't be disappointed."
1576,1,Inspirational,How one man's faith kept him through all of life's challenges. Very well played out and very well done!
1577,1,Excellent Movie!,"Movie arrived on time and in great condition. This was a birthday gift for my grandaughter and she was really happy. I watched it and I just loved it, a great movie."
1583,1,Strange Exciting Twist,WHEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE is a fantastic book to read on a slow Saturday afternoon. I enjoyed it because I could never have anticipated the twist and turns the story takes. I think Ms. Spencer is on her way to becoming a very popular writer.
1589,1,Poitier's best,"""Lilies of the Field"" is a great movie. Even though it's in black and white, this movie puts the viewer right in the action. If you've attended Catholic school, you can really identify with the toughness of the German nuns. All characters are believable, and the acting is first rate. I heartily recommend this movie to anyone."
1601,1,Common sense from years ago,"It is not a book, as such, just several wonderful hints that are great to see in this day and time."
1605,1,Hot Stuff!,"I bought this item and have been really happy with it! Having my coffee become lukewarm was a real pet peeve, but no more! Every sip is now just the perfect temperature... not hot enough to burn my tongue, but definitely hot, not warm. A caution... if you forget to put your cup on the warmer and your drink does cool down, the warmer is not hot enough to heat it up.Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer"
1609,1,"AMAZING, WONDERFUL DEVICE!","Sometimes it takes me forever to get to my coffee, and by then it's cold. Cold coffee sucks! So I microwave it 3-4 times a morning and it progressively tastes worse and worse. Well I tell you: it's all the microwave's fault! I just finished the last sip of a coffee that I poured over 6 hours ago, and it was just as warm and delicious as it was 5 hours and 50 minutes ago (see, I really am slow)! Now that I have my Mr Coffee warmer I am a happy, more efficient worker. I need to get another one for my home! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!"
1610,1,Hot Coffee All Day,Glad to have found this nifty little device. Works as advertised. Keeps your beverage hot without over-cooking it. I think this would work well with a big mug of soup as well. Can't tell you how many half-consumed mugs of coffee have been saved by this. It's great to pick up my mug an hour after I poured the coffee into it and take a hot swig.
1611,1,Great Coffee Warmer,"I bought one of these coffee warmers to keep my coffee warm at the office. It really does the job. Note you cannot pour cold coffee into a mug and expect this device to heat it -- that isn't the purpose. If you set your warm coffee on this heater, get up go get something out of the printer, get distracted talk to people, come back to your desk 15 min later your coffee will still be warm, maybe even hot depending on how hot it was when you poured it in there. I love it. I bought one for home too. The success of the coffee warmer is also dependent on your coffee mug. I find it works best with coffee mugs that have a large surface area at the bottom. I would definitely recommend this product -- I already have, I love it."
1613,1,AWESOME!,I use this at work. Turn it on before you go to get your coffee in the breakroom. Best if the cup/coffee is already warm.
1614,1,I like it!,"I like this product enough to specifically turned my computer on to write a review. It worked better than expected and kept my beverage warm. It's a mug warmer so, no, it doesn't bring your beverages to a boil (I seem to have read complaints that it doesn't heat up their beverages, though that could be for a similar product.) I think my tea was actually a bit hotter than the original temperature when I pulled it out of the microwave and put it on the warmer. I am just very happy that my tea doesn't turn cold within 5-10 minutes."
1615,1,Hot Coffee,"This is the 4th mugwarmer that I have bought - still using the other 3 in different places. Had a hard time trying to find one in the stores, so I was thankful to find one on Amazon.com. I selected this one because it was a good price and seemed more substantial than the others. So far it works great - no complaints at all. My other mugwarmers are white. I like the black color because it seems to blend better with my nice wooden office desk. I would recommend it!"
1617,1,Must have for the office!,This has got to be one of the best office companions ever! It really does work! It does its job of keeping my coffee/tea warm. A very good buy and must have!
1619,1,GREAT GREAT GREAT!,"I finally found a cup warmer that actually keeps my coffee hot! I have a very narrow threshold of how hot I like my coffee (piping hot, if it gets even remotely cooler, I can't stand it). This unit keeps it at nearly the optimal temperature.To further optimize my coffee temperature control, I bought a Titanium coffee mug from REI (very thin with great heat transfer) for about 30$. This set-up is perfect. I can walk away from my desk for any amount of time and return to a perfectly hot cup!You do have to start with a hot cup of joe to begin with though."
1628,1,Magick for REAL people!!!,"This is a great book...It's filled with a hundred spells from various cultures, religions and traditions that work independent of any specific culture, religion or tradition. What's wonderful about it, is that Draja focuses on making magick PRACTICAL. How refreshing! A lot of the spells are simple to perform and require items that are easily available to most people. There are a few spells that i find to be rather peculiar or overly time-consuming, but they're an interesting read at the least. He provides practical spells for most of the situations that people encounter in their daily lives...money, health, jobs, luck, relationships, etc. He does have a slight paternal tone in telling people not to alter the spells, but i take that to simply be a guardrail for the novice magick user. It's a great little sourcebook for spells and as inspiration to help you create your own. Definately a ""must-have"" for me! =))"
1632,1,This is a great little CD,I was really pleased after purchasing this CD. Had heard Derryl in person a couple of times and thought he was good. His CD shows his versatility and there wasn't one tune I didn't love. He is also a great performer.
1635,1,Great bench for the money,"I bought this bench for my husband as a gift. I'm pretty impressed with the sturdiness so far. It took me over 2 hours to assemble by myself and there were a couple errors in the instructions but nothing I couldn't figure out pretty easily. Overall, a fantastic bargain. He was thrilled."
1638,1,Thanks,Thank you for answering my questions and sending the product in a timely manner as it was described to me.
1640,1,Best season yet!,"My daughter and I have been watching all the seasons together. After season 8, we were feeling done with the series but couldn't quite let go. Are we ever glad we didn't! This was an action packed season and we thoroughly enjoyed it."
1660,1,Chao Bella...,"""When you love 'em they drive you crazy because they know they can"" is just one of so many truthful, poignant, memorable lines from this intelligent, warm, grown-up story. This isn't just a movie, it's the tradition of story telling at it's finest. The music, settings, and characters tell such a fine, truthful tale, I swear I can smell the food in the kitchen, dining room, or restaurant - you'll see what I mean when you see the movie!"
1661,1,ONE OF MY FAVORITES,"I never grow tired of seeing this movie. I am not sureif it is because I am Italian and can relate to so many of the scenes and actions, or if it is the excellent acting that Cher,Nicolas Cage and the others put forth in their roles.A love story that grabs your attention from the first act and holds you glued to your seat throughout the movie.Tender, sweet and loving, yet tinted with such true to life raw emotions. Outstanding.This is one movie that no one should miss seeing! Excellent!"
1664,1,Perfect,"This is perhaps the most romantic movie I have ever seen. But don't let the word romantic turn you away-this movie is hilarious. There is something in this movie for everyone. Cher and Olympia are great and both deserved the Oscar. It's not full of fluff or trash-it's the perfect date movie.also reccomended: Moulin Rouge, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, About a Boy.*"
1672,1,Easy Purchase....Great Savings!,Thanks to Amazon I no longer have to run to the store to get diapers they just show up on my doorstep! And the savings is great!
1674,1,great price and condition,"Just noticed I could buy open box pampers for cheaper, this arrived just the outside was opened, but who cares we any how dont keep the box, the pampers where closed in original package."
1677,1,Love these! Great for my twins!,"We have 5-month old B/G twins. I love these diapers. They are thin, yet they protect very well. We haven't had diaper rash yet and will hopefully stay that way. But I do rinse them off almost every time they poop. We tried huggies and they just didn't hold up - too bulky and too many leaks. So go with these!"
1678,1,Pampers work!,"I find pampers work better for longer leaner babies, toddlers than for chunky babies. Less leakage. Huggies work better for chunky babies."
1685,1,wonderful diapers,"great value, great diaper, my 21 month old daughter leaked in every other brand except PAMPERS, i love pampers brand, however i did have to buy a size 5 in the Pampers and in other brands she could wear a size 4 but i wont buy any other brand now."
1698,1,Love these diapers,"These diapers have been my go to with both my children. They do not leak overnight, and do not cause any skin irritation like other diapers. If you are looking for a quality diaper, order Baby Dry diapers!"
1699,1,Cheapest I can find - even compared to the wholesale stores!,"Great product, arrives on time in a perfect box each time. Can't beat the great price!"
1704,1,Very Good,"Pampers diapers are the best diapers. I would not recommend any other brand of diapers. No matter what stage and/or size your child is, this brand works the best."
1710,1,Great Diaper,"Diaper works great - my son is dry till morning. Thin diapers. Only bad is on two occasions, we have had the tape break on us ."
1714,1,diapers and wipes,Had no issues whatsoever and the products came as scheduled in great condition. Much better than driving to the store for diapers and wipes and here I am saving money. I wish I knew about this sooner!
1717,1,Awesome overnight diapers!,"To be honest, when I first read the box (when my son was a newborn), I thought to myself, why would I ever keep my baby in one diaper for 12 hours (ewwwwww!) but the second he began sleeping through the night, I figured it out (hah!).These diapers are great and we have never had a morning blow outs, despite our son sleeping 12+ hours a night and definitely releasing a lot of substance into the diaper during that time. Moreover, he tends to roll several times at night and gets up and plays actively in his crib for a while (before we realize he is up) and even so, with all the movement, bouncing and a full diaper, there haven't been any leaks.We've put him in other diapers overnight and he's blown through all of those."
1720,1,Diapers,"Cheaper than purchasing in the store. Comes to my house, and it is always a better price. What's not to love?"
1721,1,pampers,I love just being able to buy diapers for the month from Amazon and it saves me a lot of money and trips to the store.
1724,1,The best!,I have tried multiple diapers and these work the best. They have the best fit and are great for overnight sleepers.
1732,1,They did what diapers do...,What can I say...they performed their duties as expected. I like the Pampers diapers and will continue to use them.
1741,1,Only disposable that's ever worked for us!,"I mostly use cloth diapers during the day, but for overnight and going out, I go with disposables. We're on our 3rd baby now, and over the years Pampers has been the ONLY disposable diaper that we can rely on! Have tried cheaper brands sometimes - they're cheaper for a reason! Pampers has consistently given us a diaper that we can count on not leaking. Store brands, Luvs, Huggies have all failed us multiple times, just leak really bad or tear easily. I am rarely brand-loyal, but Pampers is now the only brand of disposable I'll buy. Pampers is a good quality disposable for the times that you need it (I still recommend using mostly cloth and more natural products though!)"
1746,1,"great price, quality and to the door service","I have shopped around and this is the best deal for the top quality diapers out there. The time of the free delivery of the diapers from Amazon varies with my two orders. The first time it took a couples of weeks and the second time it arrived in a couple of days. So you should plan ahead to order these big package diapers. But in my opinion, it is well worth it!"
1759,1,love it,my baby stays dry and happy all the time i only use pampers especially the 222 count which is a real value
1763,1,Pampers are best,"Have tried all diapers. My boys leak out of all except these baby dry pampers, didn't try the cruisers since they are more expensive. It should say something since all the hospitals I work t use pampers. Swaddles are best for new babies and baby dry from then on out. Amazon has great prices. Love when you have amazon mom and the extra coupon from parenting magazine"
1768,1,Jessica B.,very good product! good price for the amount too when compared to the stores. this products ships in a short amount of time too.
1770,1,Pampers purchase on Amazon,"I have used pampers for my son ever since he has been born. Great product and I love the rewards program they have as well.I always buy my Pampers through Amazon, I have yet to find them cheaper (even at Sam's Club). I also love the easy of having them sent right to my door."
1771,1,Pampers Are the Best,Hands down pampers are the best diapers. Never had a problem with leaking or skin breakdown on my baby.
1780,1,"A ""MUST READ"" (or re-read)","This beautifully told story belongs in every library, and then....lend it out as often as possible! It's a ""classic"" of the ""Holden Caulfield genre, and although I don't know, I'd imagine it's now, or has been, studied in High School English/writing programs."
1799,1,very pleased bride,"I loved the dress! Ive orderd the dress on two seperate times. The first time I orderd it was to see about the sizes, because I read in the reviews that some people felt it was too big/small. I found that the dress really runs true-to-size. Then I orderd the rest of the dresses for my bridesmaids. The dress is made really well, and will hold up. You dont have to worry about it loosing its shape on the bust area because it has parallel stays. Also it is fitted thru the natural natural waist, so again we didnt worry about the other measurments. Honestly I have seen the dress in bridal stores for twice the price, and im glad that I didnt pay the extra price!! The shipping from PacifiPlex was awesome as well. It tells you to expect it in a week or so, and both times it has shown up in under three days!"
1804,1,Inspirational Message,The word of God set to music. An inspirational message in every song. Lift your spirits.
1808,1,A serious masterpiece,"The other reviews are good. Trouble right now is that the DVD is becoming unavailable. This import is spoken in English, don't worry, and subtitles can be turned off. It's the full wide screen. The end credits are cut short before the music stops, which spoils that mood, but not ""in the middle of the credits"". There's a bit of nudity with Rees.The title may mislead people into thinking it's a cheap gore film. No, it's a literate masterpiece, and based on a serious novel."
1811,1,Top 5 books,"Get it, read it, listen to it, get into your brain and heart and start to implement the things that are there. It will change your life."
1823,1,"Bruce Didn't Invent Happiness, 'Just Made It Easy to Find","This tape can be the key to opening up a whole new happy life for anyone who wants it. That is exactly what it did for me when I learned the Option Method 17 years ago. On this great intro to the Option Method, Bruce DiMarsico dispells the mystique around unhappiness by exposing the notion that the experience of unhappiness is always based on what someone believes... often erroneously. Questioning the belief(or judgement or assumption) can effectively vaporize the unhappy conclussion. Hearing one of Bruce's original lectures on Option rekindles the fire in me to spread the word to other happiness-seekers. Do yourself a favor... get this tape and let yourself out of YOUR prison of unhappiness. If I can do it, anyone can!"
1826,1,A must read for fans,"I just finished reading this wonderful book about the Northern European myths that Tolkien borrowed and reshaped to make the lands, people, and languages of Middle-earth come alive. For the price and content, this is a great value. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Tolkien's fiction!"""
1828,1,11 x 14 Windsor Newton canvas pack,The item came in record time and in perfect condition. This was the second time that I have ordered this item and I will reorder it again in the future possibly in a different size.
1839,1,relaxing and uplifting,"I'm a massage therapist and have lots of CD's to relax during massage and this is one of my favorites. I had the cassette and finally, many years later found this CD on Amazon and am so excited to listen to my good friend Rainforest Magic again."
1852,1,TRANE!!!!!!!!,"All that needs to be said about ""A Love Supreme"" is --- BUY IT! If this disc is not in your collection, you are missing out on one of the most vital pieces of music ever recorded. No matter what your musical tastes are, I guarantee you will find something of interest in Trane's visceral and evocative performance. A classic of sheer beauty and emotion. Peace."

1859,1,Hard to find this product now.,I like this scent and it is no longer made in this particular configuration...I was happy to find it so reasonably priced here.
1863,1,helped with bypass recovery,"My husband was recovering from bypass surgery and could not slide forward to get out of chair, bed etc. With the silk Pajamas he could get to the edge of the the seat and then stand with the aid of the walker. Amazon was the only place I could find this product. That was 6 weeks ago. He likes them so well he won't wear anything else, They have been laundered many times and still look like new"
1864,1,Review for Intimo Silk Pant,"I have ordered this same pajama pant before, and they wear well. The size is also accurate. Color is true to photo."
1872,1,Frommers South Africa,"My family and I took five books about South Africa with us, and this is the book we used and relied on the most. It proved to be the most accurate with what we experienced once there, and the book itself was the easiest to use in its layout and organization."
1874,1,Loaded with information,"I am preparing for a trip to South Africa in May to join my daughter that is studying abroad in Cape Town. I anticipate that the information packed in the pages of this book will be very helpful in making contacts with hotels, adventure planners, and restaurants. With the help from the chapter on Victoria Falls, we anticipate having a successful trip through Zimbabwe as well."
1878,1,Seals In Moisture...,"Love this oil over or mixed with my other face care products. If you use glycolic washes or treatment, you may want to consider using this afterwards. The bottle with the dropper works fine for easy control over how much you want to use. The product last a very long time making it a real bargain for such good product. For me, there is no offensive smell.I put on a light cream, add Marie Veronique sunscreen, them use my powder foundation. Just let the oil dry a little prior to using your foundation.I will buy again and again!"
1883,1,Good play,I read this because my husband had to buy it for a college course and it was actually a really good play to read :) The only part I hate about reading plays is keeping who says what straight!
1891,1,"""The Village Barbershop"" Movie","A wonderful, ""feel good"" movie......funny, poignant, delicious. John Ratzenberger shows how multi-faceted his acting abilities are. He's funny, sweet, sexy, lovable. This movie is a ""must-see""!"
1897,1,IMPORTANT NEWS ABOUT A SAD TOPIC!,"Obviously we live in troubled times. Many are unable to confront the tragic events that recently took place. Others feel it very important that they know what is ahead for all of us. If you are of like mind you will want to read NOSTRADAMUS PREDICTIONS OF WORLD WAR III. It contains a host of material from the seers earlier prophecies right on through to the third anti christ who is said to be living in the Middle East. Does this book have all the answers??? Probably not, but the author does delve into the meaning of Nostradamus words as well as bringing in the visions of other seers from our current era. And, in addition, there are other things besides predictions of World War III to contemplate -- even an invasion from space."
1899,1,Molton Brown,I bought this product as a gift for a fussy relative who has everything and is very difficult to please. She loved it! Worth every penny.
1902,1,A STIRRING ADVENTURE AND A MEMORABLE HEROINE,"THIS A STIRRING SF ADVENTURE THAT PITS A MEMORABLEHEROINE, FESTINA RAMPOS AGAINST A STRANGE ANDDEADLY WORLD WHICH SHE IS STRANDED ON. IN THE 25THCENTURY THERE IS NO WAR, CRIME OR POVERTY BUT IFYOU ARE DEFORMED, CRIPPLED YOU ARE PROBABLY AEXPLORER SENT TO DIFFERENT WORLDS AND YOUR LIFEIS NOT WORTH VERY MUCH. THIS NOVEL OF ADVENTUREAND DISCOVERY WAS FASCINATING AND FESTINA WASA HEROINE YOU CAN EASILY ROOT FOR."
1904,1,A Royal Kiss,This book is full of a young girls romance with a prince it is one of the best books i have ever read and if you like this one check out the other 2 in this sereis THEY ROCK just as much!!!!!!!!
1914,1,Time Warner sucks. TiVo ROCKS.,"My old TiVo is still alive and kicking. Got him as a gift about 8 years ago and bit the bullet and bought lifetime service. Best money I've ever spent. We have other TWC dvrs in the house; always having problems with on demand video, slow relays, delayed remote responses, playback of recorded shows. NEVER have these problems with TiVO. He's changed my life!"
1919,1,Play to Win,"First of all - you need to play to win. Using Gail's books and software can make the winning happen. Some people see patterns and trends very easily using the information and charts available to them in her books and software. Others need to study harder. I've used Gail's books and software for a long time now, and although I haven't hit the ""big one"" YET, it's just around the corner. These tools can make it happen! As Gail says, ""Smart Luck!"""
1925,1,Kal Yeast makes for a great breakfast,"Blends very easily. Has a mild taste. I put a scoop of nutritional yeast in my breakfast blender shakes (also has water, powdered milk and frozen berries or other fruit, and a sweetener such as stevia). Gives a great nutritional boost - and all those B vitamins are great for the ""nerves' before a work day begins and I like the protein in it too. Have been taking yeast for 20 years - it did take a few weeks to get used to the taste when I began, since I only stirred it in milk. With the fruit and a little sweetener - it tastes really good."
1930,1,Perfect on popcorn! Healthy for you!,"It's difficult to find flakes of yeast. I like it on home-made popcorn fresh off the stove.It adds a buttery taste to it, and the flakes catch in the crooks and crevices of the popped corn.Discovered it in Portland, OR at an art theater downtown, where they had it in a shaker, next toparmesean cheese and salt, etc.About once a month I HAD to go to that theater, no matter what movie was showing,and have some popcorn with brewer's yeast on it. Finally figured out it was right beforemy menstral cycle, and my body craved B vitamins, which this stuff is packed full of.This is a big container of it, and should last quite a while.I'll tell you, finding FLAKED brewer's years is difficult way down here in my area."
1933,1,I love this tree!,"You can definitely see the pool in the middle--if you stick your head into the branches! =) I absolutely loooooooove this tree. It is so beautiful and came out of the box almost perfect--haven't even fluffed up the branches yet and it looks wonderful. There are so many lights--800! One thing though, the lights are LED so they don't have that soft yellow glow. Instead it's kind of an ice blue glow, like ice on the branches or very sparkly diamonds. So for those of you who are more interested in the soft yellow glow, don't get this tree. Other than that it's really bright--it lights up the whole room. Very nice tree. Would buy again."
1935,1,Surpringly not boring!,"When I started this very short book, I expected it to be a drone-fest from the 1700s. However I was pleasantly surprised to find the story gripping, the satire comical and devious, and my time well spent. I even read sections of the book to younger siblings of ages 10 and 6, and they paid attention with great detail. I would highly recommend this book as a classic for a reason."
1936,1,Should Be Required Reading,"I have owned this book for quite awhile but put off reading it, fearing that it would be dull and scholarly. I was in for a wonderful surprise. His philosophy makes a lot of sense and he puts it forth in a simple story accessible to almost everyone. Many, many times I laughed out loud. It was fun as well as enlightening. The term ""sixes and sevens"" was used; what is the etymology of that expression? The violence is expressed in an absurd way, though we know awful things did and do happen."
1938,1,a good book,this book was pretty good. it was kind of weird but good. i thought that it wasnt a satire but my lit teacher said that it was so you have to interpret it as one. if you dont then it makes it look like any regular book that you would read.
1939,1,Truly a Beautiful Thing...,"I saw the show in Chicago and it was brilliant! The story is so honest and heart-felt. Harvey did a magnificent job of not turning the show into a cliched ""gay"" play."
1946,1,Offering hope in a troubled world,"This is a delightful allegory, offering hope to change the world by the persistence of one man, working one day at a time, over many years. Written after the ravages of World War I, this story tells the tree planter in all of us that the seeds of one person's dreams will change the lives of thousands.The wood block prints are an added bonus. I've given this book to sons, to foresters, and to those who need hope in troubled times."
1948,1,Savage seamless paper,"This is an off white color. More of a vanilla than a white. Ive used it a few times though, and like the color . The shipping tube is a great storage tube when not in use."
1963,1,Wonderful,That is the cutest baby on the cover that I've ever seen in my whole life. It's about time that a successful lawyer found a way to structure her career around her family!
1967,1,Detailed guide to QFT,"The book's focus is on carefully explaining what quantum field theory is. Starting from classical field theories, ie. the harmonic chain, Greiner goes on to discuss 2nd quantization for spin 0, 1/2, and spin 1 fields. The results are then applied to derive the perturbation expansion for interacting fields. The last sections on quantization with path integrals is also well written, and contains more details than eg. Sakurai. Throughout, many (sometimes tedious, but) instructive examples are presented that lots of other authors just assume to be understood already."
1968,1,Great Utility Lantern,I bought this for a backup power for our company data center. It has come in handy a couple of times and it works great. We have not used the radio or the Power utlity much but all features work well enough. I am happy with the Black and Decker lantern and would recommend it.
1969,1,"A review of the book, unlike the author below........","1st let me say you're supposed to review the book, not give us a character assassination of Mike Murdock. Mike Murdock has an impeccable record (financial AND spiritual.) Moving on.....this book is filled with scriptures and insights as to how Jesus is a true leader and how you can follow His teachings. A great book for personal and professional development!"
1988,1,The sunny side of latin-inspired nu-jazz,"With such names as Jazzanova, Rainer Truby Trio, MAW, Ian Pooley and Cujo (aka Amon Tobin), this compilation could do no wrong. Tracks were selected by Rainer Truby, a well-respected Compost project, and a guy with a low profile and a great musical instinct (check out his Glucklich series). UK's Nuphonic, along with SF's Ubiquity, is TMHO the world's no 1 label in dancefloor-friendly nu-jazz; watch out for their releases, and let everybody else wait 1-2 years for the next 'ground-breaking' and 'genre-defining' compilation from Guidance."
1999,1,How to tickle your funny bone.,"If you want to spend a fun evening with someone, watchingthis DVD is the perfect way to do it. It had us both institches. Bill Engvall is funny, funny, funny and doesn'thave to use foul words to do it."
2006,1,C-Murder iz on fire,This was one of c-murders best album also look at Bossaline and life or deathTRU RECORDS
2011,1,"Readable, informative and non-judgemental","In the preface to this new, revised 20th anniversary edition of Catholic and Christian, author Alan Schreck reflects upon the centrality of the Eucharist at the core of the Catholic tradition as John Paul II calls us to enter the ""Year of the Eucharist"". This book covers all of the topics we Catholics are frequently asked about in conversation by our non-Catholic friends: Mary, the Communion of Saints, the Pope and more. The book is not only of value for its apologetic purposes, but also for any Catholic (or for individuals wanting to inform themselves about the Faith) who wants to learn more about the traditions at the core of our Church. The topics covered remain timely in an era when many are striving to understand the true teachings of the Church."
2023,1,"Daughter of Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme","Couldn't resist the Simon & Garfunkel reference.This is easily one of the best mysteries I have ever read, and believe me I do a lot of reading. While admittedly it sometimes gets a little difficult to follow at times, I found the whole premise so different and intriguing from other mysteries I have read that it kept me going. My first thought was it is surprising that other authors haven't really tried to duplicate this type of story, but I think anything would come up short. It's like hollywood trying to remake classics or follow the same storyline (it never works). There is only one ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and there is only one ""Daughter of Time"". I am looking forward to reading another Tey novel."
2024,1,an excellent blast of the past,a different approach to what might have happend in the castle when richard III ruled england.you will become your own detective and come to your own conclusions. I looked for more books on richard III ever since josephine tey introduced me to him. Thank you J.T....
2043,1,Just Recived it,I use to have this film recorded on vidio and recorded over it and was regreting it. I bought it on Dvd. The quality is exellent and it is in widescreen it's a shame there's no Dvd extra's but it's stil a class film one of my all time favourates. It's based on the video game about Mario and Luigi tryinhg to save Princess Daisy from another dimention where diosaurs are still alive and are trying to get back from earth. I'm also glad that yoshi is on it. It reminds me of the game Super Mario World.It's well worth getting for any Mario fan
2051,1,A Manual for Life,"Excellent, profound, and illuminating. This book provides an easy-to-grasp explanation of what governs our experiences in life. It also provides a simple method to quickly eliminate and replace our unpleasant experiences with what we really want. More than a book, it is a manual for better living that you will want to refer to on a regular basis."
2062,1,A big hit!,"My 23-month-old LOVES this sticker book. He has been using it almost every day for a month, and he still loves it. I sit with him while he plays with it to help him bring the edges of the stickers up from the pages. The stickers are losing their stickiness now, but it was a good deal for a month of play!"
2069,1,Could have used this a lot earlier in life,Reading this book-I couldn't help but feel that I've wasted so muchof my life being unhappy by choice. I'll even venture to say thatthe option method could change the world as we know it if more peopleknew about it and practiced it.A book I'll continue to revisit throughout my life.
2074,1,Cant believe no one has bought the screen rights to this yet.,"Excellent read and excellent story.if done right this would be an awesome film.Getting the period right, the ship of the early 1800s, the whale attach and the story of survival -shown realistically and not exploitvily or gratuitious, the whale attack.this is a story begging to be told on the big screen. It would also make more people aware of this story that is, when first told of it, very hard to believe."
2080,1,a great story well-told and well-researched,"This is a great nautical introduction for the landlubber. Philbrick does a great job of telling the straight story of Nantucket, of whaling, of this journey, of what happened to the men, and of what happened to their legend.Philbrick especially does a great job of filling-in-the-blanks when the historical record is thin. When the men are adrift with minimal food for weeks, he uses WWII-era experiments to speculate what probably happened to the men's physiology and psychology. He interviews contemporary whale experts to evaluate the likelihood of the reputed whale behavior.Overall, a great story well-told and well-researched, and deserving of the National Book Award. It inspired me to make a trip to the New Bedford Whaling museum!"
2087,1,Best book I've read in the last 5 years,"This is a great peice of work. Nathaniel Philbrick uses a wonderful, empathetic style when telling this tragic story. If you like history, adventure, and sailing you may want to read this one twice."
2094,1,Seamless set up,I decided to drop my land line only to realize that my Tivo was now very unhappy! I checked out several options for providing wireless connectivity and decided to go with this one. Good choice. It was a breeze to setup and has operated very reliably so far - a couple of months at this point.
2097,1,Works like a charm,I hooked it up and it worked immediately...no problems and it was quite a bit cheaper than ordering the exact same thing from Tivo
2099,1,Great Extra for Tivo!,"This thing works really well. It's a little slow but that's Comcast's fault, because their internet service sucks! But this Item is pretty cool and works great too!"
2117,1,Works exactly as advertised!,There is little to say about this little item apart from the fact that it makes life with a TiVo DVR even easier and your connections and downloads much faster. Works exactly as described and is a total breeze to install. It looks very low profile and sleek and is small enough to sit anywhere (and disappear) in your a/v set up. Superb product.
2122,1,Works great with Tivo Premier,"I bought the wireless adapter to pair up with Tivo Premier. Talk about piece of cake! I took the adapter out of the package, plugged it into the USB in the back of the Tivo, ran the wireless setup and was up and running. Just be aware there are two versions of the adapter; one for wireless A/B/G and the another for N."
2128,1,Perfect for Access and Updating,"If you have a wireless connection at home, you need this now. basically, you plug and play - and enter your wireless network's password - and you will never worry about updating your TIVo again. Great reception - I have my wireless box upstairs and on the other side of the house, and the TIVO wireless receiver downstairs and on the other end of the house: no connectivity or throughput issues."
2130,1,Just Plug it in!,"This item works exactly as it says, just plug it in and the TiVo recognizes it right away. I bought a different brand before checking the TiVo compatibility chart, and it didn't work."
2133,1,"Slightly pricey, but works well without a hitch",After reading problems with other usb wi-fi adapters I thought that the additional $15 ( $25 for one obtained from CC or Best Buy versus $40 at Amazon) was well worth it if we did not have to hook up the TiVo to a telephone every night and IT was well WORTH it. Set up was easy and I have had no hitch for the past month. The router is upstairs 30 feet away and the signal strength is >80 %. Unless someone has time to get the wireless adapters locally and tinker with it and return it if it does not function ( what with the current gas prices) I would recommend getting this one. A better option would be using LAN link if the house was hardwired
2137,1,TiVo AG0100 Wireless G USB Adaptor,"I installed this so that I could get my TiVo Hi Def unit to broadband wirelessly. So far, it works great. I have had no problems with the connection to my wireless router."
2139,1,works great easy to set up,I had this working in under 10 minutes and it works perfectly. Now we don't have a phone cord running across the floor!
2145,1,Tivo wireless USB,Very good product. I paid $20 less than the Tivo site was charging. Very happy with this. My signal between PC and Tivo have no problems once I switched to Linksy's router instead of the gateway that came from Verizon.
2146,1,Excellent,I have been using my netgear wireless adapter for the last couple of years with some problems here and there. I finally caved in and bought one of these since the price is now under $40.Worked like a charm. Setup and ready to go in 20 minutes or less.Recommended.
2164,1,I love this concert...Bond rocks!!,"Ever since I started playing the violin, people were raving about this orchestra band called Bond. I borrowed my friend Paulina's DVD of the Royal Albert Hall concert and I loved every minute of it. I recommend this to the people who love violin and would enjoy watching the girls play electric orchestra instruments."
2171,1,Love it!,"Bought two of these compression shorts, it is a great buy! It may cost a bit, but it is worth the price cause it will get the job done no matter what!"
2174,1,Review for Compression Shorts,These work so well. I got a black pair for Christmas and needed a pair of white ones for my white soccer shorts. They help so much in recovery and I couldn't recommend them more.
2196,1,Great book! One of my favorites.,"I love this book. This was my first Steinbeck novel, and I thought it was great"
2206,1,A tale of two men,Time after time steinbeck has been able to tell a story and capture my attention with great words which flow off the pages. Mice and men is a great story of two men and their lot in life. You'll laugh and cry as you read this tale. And it will challenge you to ask questions you never though were there to ask.
2220,1,A wonderful Tale!,This book is a tragic tale of two farm laborers who wander around to own a land of their own. They both are an unlikely pair. George is a short and smart man. Lennie is an enormous man with a childish mind. They both are very different yet they have formed a family. They ran away from their hometown to escape the law and started to work on a ranch in the Salians valley but trouble awaits them every corner. This is a great book for the ages of thirteen or over. If you love adventure and fun then you should read this book!
2232,1,Fast and fun,"Andy Borowitz is a precious national asset - a hip, modern-day Will Rogers whose hilarious new send-up of corporate culture and the nation's ongoing corporate corruption scandals adds up to insightful and hilarious social commentary."
2234,1,Laura Todd is hunting for treasure . . .,"well, actually she's hunting for a mysterious heir who's going to inherit a fortune, if she can find them. Devlin Rafferty is hiding in Ireland, trying to heal emotional wounds that threaten to tear him apart. Ultimately, Laura finds her heir, and a love she never believed possible on the Emerald Isle. But is Devlin's love strong enough to overcome his pain? I laughed, and I sniffled as I read Laura and Devlin's story, Sex, Lies and Leprechauns . I'll be watching for Renee Roszel's new releases, and her extensive backlist."
2237,1,Loved It--Just Loved It (What an adorable movie),"I saw the previews on TV for this movie and finally talked my husband into renting it. (He usually pick out all the movies and they are usually kick-em-up types or blow-em-up ones.) My husband rented 3 movies that night, and this one was a ""token"" chick flick ""for me.""He put off watching it the first night, but the second night we watched it because the other movie was way too long. We were both moved by this movie and came away absolutely ""in love"" with it. My husband even had to admit that ""my movie"" was an ""us movie.""This movie is just really fun to watch and takes you on a journey that involves so many emotions--just what to look for in a good film."
2241,1,great date movie.,"my husband and I went to see this movie, and it had some great laughs, we love adam sandler and drew barrymore in the wedding singer and loved them just as much in this movie."
2247,1,Great product,This is by far my favorite perfume. Glad to see I can still purchase it! And at an affordable price!
2252,1,Vincent: Insightful and brave journalist,"I met Steven Vincent days after In the Red Zone had been submitted to the publisher. His personal reflections from 9/11, when he stood atop his apartment building and watch the second plane hit, brought tears to my eyes. But that was nothing compared to his remarkable insight into Iraq from his journeys there. Fresh from returning and putting his thoughts into written form, he regaled me for hours with what he learned and what all Americans must know about Iraq. I cannot recommend In the Red Zone more highly."
2255,1,Vintage Barry White,"My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed this CD. Excellent condition, packaged well, more than expected."
2257,1,topper returns,"What can I say, my wife and I love these types of old movies. Its great to get out of the every day stress and have a few laughs."
2258,1,Topper Returns,"Topper Returns was great clean fun. The actors were great. I loved every minute of the movie. My only complaint was a film problem with a short section of the tape itself. It in no way reflected on the quality of the acting, the problem was a bad tape."
2259,1,Wonderful!,"I love this movie! I hadn't seen it in years, but remembered loving it, so today I watched it. I love it. It's funny, mysterious, and dramatic. Plus it's always nice to watch an oldie and realize how different they are from today's. I would definately reccomend this!!"
2274,1,Calming and Aromatic,"Heat these in the microwave and have them set out where you are going to sit watching TV while you moisturize your hands after a paraffin dip.After dipping your hands, you can then place them in a plastic liner or plastic bags work well too. Then, place your hands into these mitts.Your moisturizing results will double when you continue to heat the paraffin on your hands. Spas tend to use electrically heated mitts, but these don't need to be plugged in and are also calming and aromatic because of the herbal mixture inside the gloves.~The Rebecca Review"
2275,1,WOW!! GREAT CD CLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY,"My goodness, this is a WONDERFUL cd, I would HIGHLY recommend Clay Aiken!!!!"
2277,1,RUDE,"Dork Rock...Please keep your cruel, gross and nasty remarks off here. You show your real character and it is so totally opposite of Clay and his fans. Grow up and find another web page to be so rude. We all wish Ruben well but PLEASE, children read these reviews and it is just not appropriate. I happen to think Clay is one of the best vocalist's to come along in many many years..and it is my right to have that opinion, as it is the right of others to respond positively to those singers they enjoy."
2278,1,Clay knows how to do it!,how can anyone use words to describe clay?? WOW!!! i can listen to his songs over and over and over again!
2283,1,The Revolution has begun,"After all the hype and the anticipation leading up to this record, I was sure I'd be disappointed. However, after just one listen of the entire cd, I have never been more happy to have been proven wrong. This cd is fantastic! It is such a solid pop album! Every song is good...many boarder on great. He takes risks on some of the song selections, but he still manages to give the fans what they want and love. Is there a slight element of ""cheese"" to the cd? Sure, but if anyone can pull it off, it's Clay Aiken. He pours his heart and soul into each song, and, just like AI2, he makes you feel like he's singing each song just for you. Bravo, Clay! You've made your fans proud, and you left us all begging for more! Can't wait to hear the next one!"
2284,1,Measure of a Man,I find that the judges on American Idol got it ALL WRONG!!! They chose Ruben because they thought he could hold the attention of the people buying the CD's. They were also wrong with Kelly Clarkson. Clay has a voice that crosses all lines and he can sing any song put in front of him and his new CD shows that TALENT. Ruben can only sing one style of song and that will be his undoing. I see CLAY around ten years from now and Ruben a vast memory. I recommend this Album wholeheartdly and and glad that my kids can listed without fear of profanity and other vulgar words.
2290,1,measure of a man,"i couldnt wait for clays album to come out, and i was not disappointed. after listening to some of the garbage the music industry produces today, this album is one that i dont mind my kids listening to and this is an artist my kids can ""idolize"""
2296,1,That's the most inaccurate review ever by Jaan,"There is no way that Amazon's reviewer can compare Clay to talentless boybands that rely on catchy background music and over-exaggerated dance moves to move CDS. Clay has real talent, something that boybands sorely lack. Even Ruben Studdard, the American Idol champion cannot come close to Clay in terms of voice quality and pure singing talent. IMO, Clay deserves his success, this is a fabulous CD by a very talented singer. And his performance at the American Music Awards was simply stunning, why else would some members of the audience give a standing ovation? Remember that the audience was made up of singers and entertainment industry people, and i'm pretty sure they weren't applauding Ruben's performance, good as it may have been, Clay was just simply spectacular. A great singer and a great CD, they don't make singers like this anymore."
2301,1,As great as I expected,"Clay Aiken has an amazing God given gift! All of his songs are well done and decent songs. They have nice lyrics that in no way would offend anyone. As a mother with small children, I would recommend this to everyone! Clay's phenomenal voice is one I could listen to every day, and have ever since getting the CD last Thursday! He has amazing range and diversity! Do yourself a favor and buy this one!"
2305,1,My BEST Christmas gift,"I received this CD as a gift for Christmas, and all I that I can say is WOW! Whenever I had the chance, I listened to Clay during the American Idol competition and my opinion was that he should have won.I enjoy all of the songs that are on this CD, but my favorites are ""The Way,"" ""Invisible,"" ""I Survived You,"" ""Measure of a Man,"" and of course, the smash single from the summer, ""This is the Night."" I can't wait to wear out this CD in my cars CD player and my CD player at work. No worries though, if I wear out this CD I will just buy another one!Buy this CD, because IT IS EXCELLENT! No one else out there even comes close to the talent of Clay Aiken. He will be around for a long time to come!Oh, and Janet, thanks for giving me this wonderful CD! :)"
2308,1,awesome!,"This CD really reflects the artist. Every track is excellent! If you are a Clay fan, I highly recommend this CD. If you aren't yet a fan, after hearing this you will be!"
2310,1,MUST HAVE CD,"OH MY GAULD!!!!!!!!!! THIS CD IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!My mother, my daughter & myself can't get enough of it! This cd will be played for generations to come.Favorite...The Way."
2313,1,"And, that's HOW you Measure a Man",Perfection! The whole family loves the CD and him! You dont need your skip button with this CD.
2314,1,BETTER WATCH OUT!,"I think Clay's CD is ABSOLUTELY GREAT!I listen to it every day. I would just like to make a point to all the Clay bashers/Ruben Studdards' fans out there. You had BETTER WATCH OUT! If you are intentionally trying to bash Clays' CD to lower its ratings, then you should prepare yourselves for when Ruben's CD comes out. Clay's fans far out number Rubens' fans and when push comes to shove..... What's that saying WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND!? Grow up,take your toys and go home. Oh and by the way Clay's CD is doing just great despite your rude comments."
2320,1,You won't be able to stop playing it,The true Clay fans will love this cd. It has songs that apeal to the country and pop fans as well as people who love the power ballad. This cd shows clays diversity and the true power of his voice. It also showcases his ability to put so much emotion into a song that it will make you cry. One warning though once you put it in your cd player you won't be able to stop playing it. If this is an indication of what Clay can do I can't wait for his next cd. It is an amazing debut cd.
2322,1,Clay is the Man!,"This Cd was fantastic. He has such an awesome voice. I am very impressed by the way that he sang those songs because all of them just got me so excited. Clay should have won, Clay really should have one. And he is going to win again on the music sales because this CD is one of my favorites of all time now."
2327,1,Surpasses the Hype!,"This cd is way higher than my expectations! I can't quit listening to it! Clay's voice shines through, there's no overproduction.....it's just Clay. And that's what we all fell in love with! I'd recommend this cd to my best friend, little sister, or my grandmother! Definitely something for all ages!"
2342,1,The Real American Idol,"I followed Clay through the American Idol process from start to finish and all I can say is I hope this is just the begining of what should be a long and successful career. This CD was fabulous and well worth the wait. There isn't a bad song on it and his voice is simply mesmerizing. I think there are several songs on it that could be hits for him. Anyway you slice it, I will buy as many CD's as this young man records. Not easy for a forty something woman to admit. : ) I am going to purchase the Idols Christmas CD just for the Clay song. My advice, buy it, you won't be sorry."
2343,1,a mix of james taylor meets elton john! breathtaking,"I personally found that this is one of the best cd's i have ever listened to. Clay aiken is not only the true american idol, but a wonderful young man with a very positve outlook and message. How refreshing. I recently tried to get concert tickets to his tour with kelly clarkson in N.C, only to find them all sold out. Instead I will will be driving to washington d.c to take my 3 year old for her birthday to his concert at the mci center. His voice is so beautiful and almost reverant. I would give this cd 10 stars if it were allowed!!!!!"
2345,1,A Powerful First Album,"A showcase for Mr. Aiken's exceptional voice, this power-pop album will have you singing along in no time. Every cut a potential Top 10 hit, there's something for everyone here, from the power-chord-filled ballad 'Run To Me', to the Beatle-esque 'Shine' and 'Perfect Day', to the country-flavored 'When You Say You Love Me', to the breathtakingly beautiful love ballad 'The Way'. A tiny disappointment for this fan: Mr. Aiken's lower register is barely in evidence. Still, that doesn't stop this album from being 100% en-JOY-able."
2353,1,Clay is the best. Jaan is not!,"I bought MOAM as soon as it came out and I love it. It's amazing that the disc isn't worn out already. When and if it does, I will just buy another one. lol :) Clay sings with such feeling and each song touches my soul. As for Jaan, I am really upset. If you do not like Clay, why are you giving a review of the album? You have no idea what you are talking about. I agree with the others: Amazon should let you go. Besides, those who have yet to discover Clay (who hasn't) may be swayed by your comments and that would be a shame!"
2354,1,I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT!!,"I can't remember of any other CD in recent years that has had such a mushroom effect as this wonderful CD. It's popularity just grows and grows. I can see why. I have listened to this CD for a month straight - I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT!! What wonderful vocal ability!It is of no wonder to me why this CD continually registers in the top 10 best sellers here. It deserves it.If you want to hear wonderful, uplifting, fresh music, and generally just amazing singing, then buy Measure of a Man. You won't be disappointed."
2355,1,MEASURE OF A SUPERSTAR!!,This is absolutely everything I have been waiting for! It has ballads- pop songs- and to my pleasant surprise-- a bit of a rock edge to it. I am normally a heavy metal girl- and that is why my friends and family have a hard time understanding my Clay obsession- but he truly represents a man whose talent goes beyond what was presented on American Idol. Very Impressive Clayton!!
2361,1,I LOVE CLAY AIKEN!!!!!,"I loved Clay Aiken the moment I saw him during the American Idol season 2 auditions (before his dramatic change) and has proved to be the best. I have seen him twice, during the American Idol seasonal tour and the Kelly Clarkson/Clay Aiken Independent tour and he just keeps getting better! My favorite song on his album is ""Measure of a Man"" because, I feel, that he is talking about God. I also love ""The Way"" because it's a really romantic song and the music video is absolutely wonderful. I HIGHLY recommend this CD to any American Idol fans or ""Claymates""-not that I am one. You won't be disappointed!"
2367,1,Best CD I have ever owned,All I can say is WOW! I think this is the best CD I have ever owned. All the songs are wonderful. I have already listened to it several times today.
2371,1,Marvellous piece,"I am really impressed and love the cd. So great to have one in my collection. His voice is so marvellous and powerful. No doubt, his songs are going to touch everyone hearts. He is the one !!!!!"
2388,1,Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!,"I enjoyed every song on this album. Clay and his producers did a great job picking out songs that showcase Clay's wonderful voice. The songs were all unique and I predict that there will be several number one songs generated off this CD. Congratulations Clay, you did a fantastic job!!"
2395,1,Just what I expected,"This guy is the real deal. I expected this CD to be great and Clay didn't let anyone down. He'll be around for a long time. I hope to see him write or collaberate with other writers on his future projects.I think both Clay & Ruben have dealt with whatever controversy there has been with class and respect for one another, I just wish their fans would follow suit. The reality of the situation is... they both won. At this point, who came in first really doesn't matter."
2411,1,Very Worthwhile Listening,"I normally buy CD's for one or two songs, and then burn my own compilations to play in the car.This is one cd that goes in the car stereo as is - too many good songs to choose only one or two.Good music, wonderful voice, crazy hairstyle - looking forward to the next cd from Clay."
2419,1,"To the reviewer who wrote""Dont buy this CD""","Dont you buy it either Honey, you take that money and buy you some reading material on how to spell, or better yet, get back into school, its very clear you are brainless.As for MOAM, it is one of the most refreshing CD's to come on the market in eons, I can understand the words even, isnt that amazing!! You go Clay!!"
2420,1,Wonderful and entertaining,"After eagerly awaiting the release of measure of a man, I purchased it after attending a meeting on Tuesday night. I listened to it on my way home enjoying each song. I would listen to one and say it was the best but then listen to the next one declaring it the best. My favorite on the CD is When You Say You Love Me. Each song displays Clay's talent as a singer displaying all of the ranges that Clay can sing. I enjoyed the CD so much and listen to it over and over on my way in to work and also while at work and on my way home from work. I did lend the CD to my daughter and she too loved it(I will purchase her own CD for her.)I hope Clay will come out with another CD soon maybe singing alot of Neil Sedak's music and even some of Barry Manilow's. Again, every Clay fan will be highly entertained when listening to the CD. Keep up the good work."
2423,1,A beautiful book,"""Divine Chuckles"" is a treasure. ""Spirit""'s wisdom, warmth and humor has something great to offer anyone who chooses to listen."
2426,1,Old School Metal!,"Love this band&ALWAY'S WILL,Seen him a dozen times&will continue to do so along with my teenage Son,rather take him to see an old school metal band than a rapper any old night!"
2431,1,Ranchers vs Old Vegas Mob,Great series featuring the beginnings of Las Vegas. Dennis Quaid is delightful as the Sheriff and I gotta love the mobsters too.
2433,1,I'm a VERY lucky man!!!!,I had this album on vinyl when it was first released in 1982 and regretted the loss of it for years!! I've been searching online for it and could only find it available for $250+!! I finally found someone selling it for a reasonable price and I GOT IT!! This is by far one the most important musical purchases I've made in years. This CD is astounding...Chaka at her best!!
2438,1,"One of the Best, but not for the inexperienced reader","This is clearly one of the greatest SF novels of all time, but the novice reader of Science Fiction should put off reading it till they are more familiar with the genre. Zelazny was a master of one of the special joys of SF: the joy of figuring out what is going on. (note that in the first Amber novel, the narrator has amnesia and you are right there with him figuring out what is going on....) At first glance Lord of Light might seem a religious mish mash, but in fact is a techno/politico masterpiece (a really wild technolgy but not so unfamiliar politics...) Combined with the out of order chapters, it is easy to see how someone who had not read much science ficture could find this book incomprehensible. But it will give great enjoyment to the more experienced reader, (and re-reader.)"
2442,1,Step into Ancient Greece,"This is the best series of books I have found for history for 9-12 year olds. I teach 4th and 5th graders and they love these books. They have interesting pictures and are written at the perfect level. I like all the art project ideas they include, the organized method in which they are written, and the timeline which runs the bottom of the pages. This is a great resource. I can't recommend it highly enough."
2452,1,THIS IS WHERE AEROSMITH MADE THERE [ $MONEY$ ],"AEROSMITH WILL FOREVER AND ALWAYS WILL BE. ONE OF THE BEST ROCK GROUPS OF ALL TIME.""DREAM ON"" IS JUST AS GOOD A CLASSIC AS ""STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN""AEROSMITH SONG'S WILL BE PLAYED ON THE RADIO UNTIL THE SUN BURNS OUT!THE LATE 80""S AND EARLY 90'S:THE CD'S IN THIS SET.ARE THE ONES THAT MADE AEROSMITH THE MOST MONEY.THESE CD'S IN THE SET MADE THEM A GROUP THAT COULD DO NO WRONG.3 HIT ALBUMS IN A ROW MADE THE TROUBLES IN THE PAST.BE PUT TO REST AND ONLY LEARN FROM THE WRONG!THESE WERE THE THE CD'S THAT AEROSMITH MADE VIDEO'S TO.AND MADE THEM A LEADING GROUP TO A WHOLE NEW GENERATION.THEY TOURED TO SOLD OUT CONCERTS EVERYWHERE BECAUSE THESE CD'S WHERE HIT MAKEING MACHINES.[AND THESE CD'S PROVED THAT GRUNGE/ALTERNATIVE COULD NOT STOP A REAL ROCK GROUP]{THESE CD'S ARE ONLY A SAMPLE TO AEROSMITH'S MUSIC COLLECTION}""BUT WHAT A PERFECT SAMPLE TO THE WORLD OF MUSIC:AEROSMITH""(ROME,NEW YORK :HOME OF WOODSTOCK 1999)"
2453,1,Genius.,"Intriguing and excellently written music paired with delightfully surprising lyrics and an engaging, intimate style make this album a must-buy. If you like John Mayer, Josh Kelly, you'll adore Andy!!!!"
2468,1,Very helpful for parents,The best thing about this book is the practical advice she provides about helping children deal with and eliminate nightmares. Her insights into protecting children from needless violent images are excellent. I can't say it strongly enough she provides sensible suggestions that if implemented would benefit generations of children.
2470,1,Challenging and Lifechanging,"Reverend Gainous presents a tremendous challenge to move beyond the medicraty of sideline Christianity by moving into a position of power and faith, which leads to ultimate victory that all believers can enjoy. His practical and personal experiences adds life to each phase of development in order to become the contenders that God expects for Christians to be. I salute this work and highly recommend it for it's excellence toward bringing believers into the reality of the personal sacrifices and price to be paid to truly enjoy God given victories. The athletic and military analagies allows the reader to relate to biblical and spiritual principles from a practical perspective."
2472,1,Crown Molding by Wayne Drake,"Wayne,I searched the web for some good info on crown molding. Your book is nothing short of fantastic. After making my own templates I felt confident enough for the real thing. Every cut was perfect. No gaps....WOW. Your tables combined with the ""Exact Angle Squares"" made for a most satisfying project. The only down side is my new ""Honey Do"" list. It just keeps growing and growing.ThanksBill"
2488,1,A Great read,This book was an amazing book that I could not put down after I started reading it. If you like adventure and a little bit of fictional history you will love this book. In Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea there are lots of great adventure scenes. I also like how Jules Verne describes everything in such detail. I would definitely recommend this book.
2493,1,Challenging but beautiful.,"The original story is lush with great vocabulary and detailed description, a little work, but well worth it. I'm reading it aloud to my 10, 9, and 6 year olds. The DK illustrated abridgement is a good supplement too."
2497,1,"I hate Chevy Chase, too!","This book is a must read for anyone who grew up watching Saturday Night Live, even in the bad years. I really enjoyed reading this book because it gave first hand accounts of events,from several different points of view. The thing that struck me most about reading this was how much talent Lorne Michaels had and misused through the years. He is nothing, if not short sighted!I also love how cast members and writers all just aired their dirty laundry. All of the feuds and petty arguments came through! What can I say, I'm sycophantic for the original cast, and several of the later casts. If you are a fan of SNL, any cast, this book is for you!"
2498,1,Some reviews are mean-spirited & personal,"...It's a fun book, full of fascinating stories, and if you like SNL, the odds are overwhelming you'll like Live from NY too. Thanks!"
2513,1,Great Knot Cards,"I purchased this item in the hopes of helping myself and my son to be better knot tiers. These little cards do a great job at educating in the art of the knot. The cards are thick plastic and should last a lifetime. If you are looking for a minimal tool to help boost your knot tying skills, a product which is long lasting, and for relatively cheap? Check this one out."
2515,1,Great Starter Cards,"My nephew wanted these for his survival kit. The cards are straightforward for him, and he's practiced them on his own. He takes them with him on his camping trips now, and likes to use these practical and functional knots. He's very happy with the cards. They're light, small, and waterproof."
2524,1,Well-written story of an amazing man,"I knew next to nothing about Booker T. Washington prior to reading this book. Now I feel honored to have had his story shared with me. Despite the risk of sounding cliche, he has become an inspiration and hero to me. If not for his convictions and spirit, he would have been quite ordinary. Instead, he accomplished incredible goals, overcoming unimaginable feats, and has reached an inumerable amount of people, generation after generation. This book is a mainstay on my bedside table. Required reading for all."
2533,1,Stanford Mission Coffee Table,"Love the table it is very well made and sturdy. The first shipment had to be sent back because the apron was lined up incorrectly. That was a hassle, as well as it took me over 3 months to receive the table in the first place (they had trouble locating it in the warehouse). But I am very pleased with the actual table! It is far more beautiful than the pictures depict. Beautiful wood and very elegant. Very easy assembly."
2539,1,works like a charm,"The installation of drivers for this card was easy, and I now have easy access to firewire and USB 2.0 on my notebook. There is an optional AC adapter available for this product, but for use on my desk, I just use a firewire/USB hub combo that is powered. I have nine hardware devices daisy-chained from this card to powered hubs with no problems at all. It is recommended to only use one USB port at a time unpowered, such as on the road. I don't expect to need more than that if I'm mobile."
2545,1,A necessity for everyone,"I graduated college in 1961 with an engineering degree from a highly rated school. A required non-engineering course was economics. I remember very little from that class except for a little red book authored by someone named Huff and that that book was one of the most enjoyable and educational books from my whole college career. [After an exhaustivesearch for the book, I found it and] I grabbed it! This book has saved me untold dollars by teaching me to look at most statistics with a very jaundiced eye and to laugh at most commercials. I just put my copy in with the materials I use to teach a class at a local community college since I expect that we [will be able to use the book to discussvarious issues related to current day politics.] I am also ordering several copies for gifts including one for my college freshman grandaughter. So what if the author states that a Yale graduate is doing well at an annual salary of $24,000. Everything else is current."
2556,1,I love this album,"This is my favorite album this year. Although folks are calling it a ""concept"" album, I prefer to think of it a a rock opera wedged somewhere between Sgt Peppers and Eldorado. My 16 year old daughter and I are currently fighting about which song is the best, but we love them all."
2557,1,"""Good Stuff""","I first obtained this product in a gourmet chocolate shop in Punta Gorda, Florida. I enjoyed it very much, but after returning home to Maryland I had no idea where I could purchase more. I went to Amazon and there it was. Thank you, Amazon."
2559,1,I always use this cookbook,"This cookbook is filled with easy to make recipes that are light(er) than standard and that also taste good. I say ""light(er)"" because some recipes like the easy chicken stroganoff use ingredients like light sour cream and pasta. While it isnt the lightest meal, it is lighter than is relatives and still tastes good. All of the recipes list calories, fat, carbs etc..I do not think I have actually made anything from this book that wasn't good and I have cooked at least 30 of the books recipes at least once.I am a pretty lazy cook and selfish with my free time. I do not want to mess with something that has tons of ingredients, long preparation or long cooking times. When I use this book I target recipes that can be made in around an hour or less and that have a simple list of ingredients. There are many to choose from in that category.I have recommended this book to all of my friends and several co-workers."
2563,1,Horn of the Hunter,I loved his stories of Africa! The book took me back to a better time when being on safari meant you could be killed by very dangerous animals or reptiles but humans were not quite as high up the list in the danger catalogue.
2565,1,Vitrin,Well you know your really never sure about taking a pill with no actual effect like a pain reliever but all my research on Vitrin points out that its one of the best out there on the market especially if your not getting all your fruits and Veggies!
2568,1,An excellent book,"This is truly an excellent book, and a great sequel to ""Harriet the Spy."" I read this in 2nd grade, almost immediatley after I finished ""Harriet the Spy"" and loved it. I wish Louise Fitzhugh would have written more. Louise Fitzhugh is a great author, and her books will always be classics in my library."
2582,1,Love this Product,When I am feeling lazy I love that these are quicker and easier than flossing. If you're careful they do the trick every time (but don't tell your dentist - he'll say they hurt your gums ...sure- if you use them like a pick axe...). Only problem: I can't find them anywhere - likely they are too good a value. You get a lot of them for a small price - so I'm guessing that's why my Walgreen's stopped carrying them in favor of fewer for more. I tried to order them online through amazon but it was about $20 to ship a $2.99 product...
2584,1,The best,"These brushpicks are the best on the market. A friend got me started on them and I used to buy them at a chain store, but now they don't carry them anymore. I could not find them anywhere until I looked at Amazon. I am so glad the Amazon still carrys them. Please Amazon, always carry this one product."
2590,1,Works great!,PROS:Takes 5 minutes to install or removeFine in all weatherLooks coolSturdyCONS:Front tire is permitted limited movement (using a $2 bungee cord to secure it works well)No way to secure the bike or carrier with a lock for security
2592,1,B Movie Nirvana,i love these old B Movies. I remember watching these films many years ago and it;s a pleasure to see them again.
2594,1,Walkthrough.......................,"..................that packs lbs onto your harvest. Gains, gains and more gains. If I have any questions I turn to The Cannabis Grow Bible: the definitive guide to growing marijuana for recreational and medical use, because the answer is always in here and always top stuff. I have gone from respectable harvests to super sized gains. This is a walkthrough from start to finish that shows you all the pros and cons of doing it this way or that way. You get loads of alternatives on each of the growing methods. It even shows you how to build your own hydroponics if you want hydro. It is very cheap to grow an unbelievable bulk of quality skunk if you learn how with this book. I want to say thanks, thanks, thanks for the excellence that I found in here."
2597,1,If I could give it TEN stars I would,"I had so much fun working out to this video, when it was over I wanted to do it again. The routines are challenging, but it just makes it more fun to do. If you love to dance, you will love this video."
2598,1,Very fun video and not hard to follow!,This is a great intermediate video. It's one of my favorites. It's set to Motown music and it's very fun. The moves are dancy but Donna has great cueing and after a couple of times you get it down. I don't like videos that are easy the first couple of times through because I get bored to fast. I recommend this video to anyone who enjoys dancy aerobics. IT'S FUN!
2599,1,great book,"The author relates his experience to even the most novice hunter (myself). He has a scientific, common-sense approach to deer hunting that gives confidence in his methods and makes you want to use them. His section on deer vocalizations can be confusing, but who can communicate inarticulate sounds thru plain text... However, it is fairly easy to find recordings of deer calls on the internet to clarify this matter."
2604,1,Purchased for my Dad,Thanks. I purchased this for my Dad. He was part of that generation. Many thanks!
2610,1,Excellent capturing of my parents' generation..,"Tom Brokaw does an excellent job of interviewing and capturing the impact of WWII on the lives of these heroes and heroines. The war experience was the common bond that elevated this generation to strive for greatness not only for their own lives but for the entire nation. Brokaw, drawing from his vast experience and skills as a newscaster, is able to extract stories of great bravery and self responsibility from each of the individuals interviewed. He brings out the sense of loyalty, duty, honor, respect and self worth, not found in today's generation."
2617,1,Wonderful book,"This book is filled with beautiful pictures that any one would enjoy. I bought it for myself, but my mother ended up with it. The photographs are amazing."
2623,1,"FAST SERVICE: CLEAN, NEW BOOK",This was a very interesting read about the beginning of the modern foodie movement and the Frenchman responsible for it. The historic recipies included make it possible for a modern reader to eat as royalty once did.
2625,1,"An uplifting, honest publication","Thank you, Kathe, for openly sharing your journey through the grief. This spiritual publication has opened up so many different emotions for me, so many unexpected feelings of loss, guilt, anger... After taking the journey myself, I have begun to walk again -- with others -- through their grief and pain. Thank you for providing the structure and 'path' which opens up the possibility for healing. Wonderful work, guided by God..."
2627,1,Very helpful!,I read/journaled in this book after my second miscarriage. It helped me with things that I did not even know I needed help with. I liked the guided questions and found them to be very helpful. I also know someone who read this 6 months after her miscarriage and she found she had already worked through a lot of the things that the book touches upon. Overall great book and made me feel more normal with the reactions I have had.
2629,1,THEY ARE BACK,"They are back the girl group that has a 4x platinum cd (that means they sold over four million copies of SURVIVOR). Man i was really hesitent to buying this cd because, face it they kinda died out a whille a go, but anyways I have boughten remix cds that i am not very happy with (example: ALL SAINTS- The Remix Album) This cd is excellent I can't get over the tracks, My favorite song is jumpin jumpin (remix) lil bow wow rox on this track. Also the song EMOTIONS (remix) is great some one below stated that it does not play smoothely, my [butt] ! Its a grat dance tune. Take my advice, trust me (I have over 250 cds, this is definitly in the top 30) and go buy this kick [butt] cd!"
2630,1,THE REMIX IS IN !,"THIS ALBUM HAS SO MANY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT.THE WHOLE CD IS NOTHING BUT BOOTYSMAKIN GOOD.(BOOTYLICIOUS LICK'EN GOOD)THE REASON I GAVE DC(3) A 5 IS BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE KELLY,MICHELLE, AND B'EYONCE IN IT.IT ALSO HAVE MY OLD TWO GIRLS.LATOYA AND LATAVIA.THIS WHOLE CD IS THE BOMB.AND I REALLY THINK U SHOULD GET IT. DC(3) 3EVER."
2652,1,Great cooker,"If you're a brown rice cooker in particular, please buy this product, satisfaction guaranteed. If you want fast rice, stick with Rice-a-roni. But if you want rice to die for buy this product."
2655,1,Perfect for my needs,"Ordered this for doing core training, situps, back hypers, etc. Was fairly easy to inflate with the provided pump. The DVD is okay as it provides a basic blast routine for beginners. Very happy with this purchase and have since purchased the 55 cm as well."
2660,1,The Beta Band: I can't wait to witness them...,THE BETA BAND is what was good about the Beach Boys and Love & Rockets.
2661,1,This is your brain talking - 'BUY THIS ALBUM',Beck meets the Stones . . . the party starts there . . . by the time the everyone's feeling comfortable with their cocktails . . . Primal Scream drops in for a righteous time. Beg Borrow or steal - Beta Band rocks with some originality of their own and some originality of their early brethen. Probally sound as good in your garage as they do on this album.
2666,1,Inspiration for enriching ministry.,"I am using the book ""Lectures to my Students"" by C. H. Spurgeon in my Homelitics class. Spurgeon's insights have enlarged my horizions as to how I read and analyse The Holy Scriptures. The book has enhanced my teaching greatly."
2669,1,To a very special comedian who is missed.,I enjoyed reading this book written by his mom. It gave me insight into the way Freddie was raised and how he was when he was younger. One thing Freddie had... he was a gifted comedian. I read this book probably 8 years ago and I still cherish my copy. I thank his Mom for writing it and for giving his loyal fans a bit of comfort by hearing her side of the story. God bless her.
2673,1,THIS CD IS GOOD,I love the SweatSuit new cd it is so good.I guarante you'll like atleast 6-8 songs off this ablum.Please support Nelly be getting this ablum.

2680,1,Does not fit Honda Odyssey 2011,Looks like a nice rack; too bad they didn't make it clear that it DOES NOT FIT THE 2011 Honda Odyssey before I ordered the rack and had to send it back. The plastic faring on the top of the rear hatch is the problem.
2682,1,Perfect for my 08 PRIUS,"This was the third rack I tried on my Prius. Although, it doesn't specifically say it will work, online reviews on the prius boards made me believe this was the best choice and it was. Simple to use, great website with video so its impossible to make a mistake. A part was broken when I recieved my rack , called Saris and they immeadiately put a replacement as well as 2 spares in the mail. Have only used with 2 bikes but it works great & looks awesome on my red car."
2684,1,Reviving wonderful memories,"I remember seeing Amahl on TV in my teenage years, and it is very hard to find it being produced. So I was delighted to find this original, and at a reasonable price. I got one for myself and one for my granddaughters. Shortly after I ordered it, there was a production on TV (in color, which was nice), but it wasn't as good quality as this original. Thanks for making it available."
2689,1,Enchanting,"A spell binding book. One can not stop reading. Sometimes you start believing, that magic could be real. I felt with Jessex and Kirith Kirin throughout the hole book. One hopes for them to win the great war and above all to be together one day happy and untroubeld. I wish Arthen would be real and I could go there one day to become young again. I'm waiting for a sequel."
2692,1,outstanding way to learn about he USGA,"I highly recommend this book. It is a great, behind-the-scenes look at how much work and planning goes into each Open Championship. It's exceptionally well-written, and easy to understand and follow. And reading it on my Kindle made the experience that much more enjoyable."
2700,1,Such a Funny Movie!,"The Spongebob Movie is such a hilarious movie! Loads of laughs will leave you wondering why there wasn't such a funny movie released before! This is a story about Spongebob and Patrick's quest to find King Neptune's crown, who is left bald if in lack of this crown. THis is all part of Plankton's Plan Z, which was started to actually work. Even though it is very slap-stik, this movie will not leave you disappointed!"
2711,1,The Six Sigma Way Book Review,"The Six Sigma Way is an easy reading book and a must have for anyone contemplating the deployment or currently deploying Six Sigma. The book not only gives an A-Z detail on why,who,what and how to rolling out Six Sigma, it is also an excellent reference tool.The author's bring to life the usefullness of Six Sigma through rela-life examples from various industries.The Six Sigma Way practices what it preaches- it's customer focused and friendly."
2715,1,One of the best,"Easy reading, great subjects . Would recommend it to anyone. Am passing it around in the family. Great bit of humor."
2722,1,A good product,"I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be. I would get an XXL next time around, but otherwise it's a great product."
2723,1,Shades of Gray,"Great awareness raised on the real person, Gray Barker, who is responsible for the making of hollowood movies that we have enjoyed. I did not want to miss a second of this documentary. Applause for a well thought out and put together documentary. Great Job!!!!"
2726,1,Great watch,"Its a great watch for one with a smaller wrist. I have the Storm which has served me well since 1996 (which i hope they can repair, with a new batterry). I wear it every day doing heavy duty Construction Reno's after my years of Diving. These are serious watches (whether diving/swimming or doing serious outdoor activities). An active outdoor guy watch"
2728,1,John & Paul WHO ?,"Definitely Maybe shows The Beatles what they were missing, that gutsiness to give the whole world the Vs. Kicking off with the rip roaring Rock 'n' Roll Star and ending with the lullaby that is Married With Children, this album is certainly the best thing Oasis have ever produced. Never mind all the hype and acclaim that came with Morning Glory, it could never match the extra punch that Definitely Maybe packs. Live Forever and Slide Away are the album's highlights and isn't it curious that from the bad's first three albums, the best song from each wasn't released as a single; Slide Away, Champagne Supernova and Fade In-Out. I'll bet Gas Panic! isn't a single!"
2733,1,Liam and Noel's greatest hour,"I cant tell you what it is about this album that makes it so appealing. If anyone can put thier finger on the undefineable attraction of this musical masterpiece they deserve a round down at the dog and duck. Full of exceptional songs, this has to be a front runner for album of the 90's. Rock 'n' roll star is a great opener which is followed by Shakermaker, a real piece of psycadelica. Other tracks that are prominent are Supersonic (Oasis' first single) and Cigarettes and Alcohol. Others such as Up in the sky and Digsy's dinner are of high standard but it is (contrary to popular belief) Slide Away that is the weakest track of the lot. A must for any self respecting music conneseur. Amazing."
2737,1,Great for keeping stuff from little kids.,"I have a 1 year old and a 3 year old. The 1 year old can't open the can, the 3 year old has enough trouble that the adventure isn't worth it. So all the icky goodies stay in the can and not all over the house."
2738,1,A ton of fun,So much fun to play! The black key's first album is true blues and full of soul. and it's a limited edition 180 gram vinyl.
2742,1,Raw.,"I was introduced to the Black Key's through they're most recent album, Brothers. Loving what I heard, I snapped up Rubber Factory and The Big Come Up. I have to say, this might be my favorite of the three. Each album has it's fine points, but this one in particular has a rough, almost bootlegged quality of sound to it. Each track is filled with an infectious raw energy that's hard to resist. And ""Breaks"" is probably my favorite Key's song to date--a catchy-ass screeching guitar lick loops over an almost hip-hop sounding drum beat. Then Auerbach's voice slides in, smooth as ice, and I can't pull the grin off my face."
2758,1,Kit is doing slave work but still has time to fall in love.,"I really loved the book. One day I just grabbed it off my classes book shelf for a book report, thinking oh great another snoozer, but when I started to read I just couldn't put it down. I'm handing the book report in tomorrow and I'm not worried because since I loved it so much I found all the right words to say."
2763,1,THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE BOOK EVER!!!!!!,This was the greatest book i've ever read and i think everyone in the world should read it and i think everyone should buy lots of copies for all their family and friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2766,1,"A romantic, historical fiction novel about justice, love, courage, and friendship","Kit Tyler has lived her whole life in the beautiful, Caribbean country of Barbados. Her first glimpse at her new home in Connecticut tells her that her life in colonial America will be nothing like the beautiful and elegant world she has always known. She doesn't understand the stern and somber people here--especially not the mischievous sailor, Nat Eaton, who always turns up when she least expects it. In her loneliness, she develops a dangerous friendship with an outcast widow many of the townspeople think might be a witch. But how much will that friendship cost her?The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a wonderful story about coping with change and learning to be true to ourselves. Through the gentle affection of the Widow Tupper, Kit learns to find her vocation in life--and in love."
2772,1,Great car for the price The kids (and myself) love it.,For the price this little car has a lot of features head and tailights and the ability to run another at the same time without interference due to the different frequencies available. These cars have been crashed into walls and each other over and over and seem to be ok. The only one that broke took a flight off of a desk and the steering linkage snapped on one wheel when it impacted the floor. Cant really complain about that. I bought extras for the price. What really matters is that it entertains the young ones and is helping them learn the controls before moving to more expensive models.
2776,1,One of the best live albums ever,This is quite simply one of the very best live albums ever. Plain and simple!
2781,1,4.85 STARS: A Classic Hard Rocking Album --Very Underrated,"I don't understand Noel's disdain for this record. Hell, it might be my FAVOURITE Oasis album of all (7) !! I bought the album on August 26, 1997 and it has been close at hand ever since. This is a pure, powerfully agressive masterpiece that I bet will get recieved better as the yrs go by. This record is about as subtle as a nuclear bomb. Raw aggression, yet still very listenable. Unlike the ""hard rock"" that is played on the radio these days, there is some quality to it. Sure, it's a bit overdone, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. To me, music serves as escapism, a mood changer of sorts and BHN completes that mission with flying colors. If you haven't listened to BHN in some time, try it again. If you have never heard BHN give it a try. THIS IS OASIS in it's purist, rawest form !!! BTW, I got to see them live on the BHN tour !!!!"
2782,1,"Oasis Rules, Dont Go Away",every song on it kicks but the song Magic Pie was not all that good. I still like the song. Oasis rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2793,1,Excellent Read,"I loved this book! It is no wonder why disney adapted it to the big screen.As with all books turned into movies, the book is different but better. So if you are looking to follow the story of the film... just rewatch the movie lolthe moment I finished this book I went and purchased the other 6 books in the series... :-)"
2801,1,nice Pitcher,Received the item and it is just like advertised. Purchased it to replace a small frothing pitcher so I can foam milk for more than one cup of coffee.Nice quality pitcher.
2802,1,Provides great frothed milk,"When I am making my daily latte, I always start by filling this halfway up with milk and putting it in my refrigerator while I get my machine set up. When my espresso machine is ready, I pull it out of the refrigerator and start frothing the milk. I can easily access the milk and make some good froth & heat up the milk quickly. Works great!"
2804,1,stainless steel frothing cup,This item is just what I needed for our new espresso machine. The item is nice and large enough to froth milk without making a mess.
2810,1,Great Set,this is actually my second set i bought; i think i lent my first set to a friend who i no longer remember and therefore cannot get back from. obviously i liked these books enough to buy them again despite the fact that i might find my old ones later.
2811,1,"Great, Great Books",These books are great. It starts off in a suspenseful environment and Eric writes this so well too keep the reader well entertained and keeps it with the videogame.The price and shipping timing were excellent. Go Eric and Go Amazon!!!!
2823,1,What jazz is,"Consider this the best album in the Blue Series, although it's not in the Blue Series. Powerful, extremely thoughtful and spontaneous improvisation, and a monstrous, earth-shattering groove from Parker and Drake. It also seems just about official with this album that Rob Brown is one of the absolutes of music in our time. His playing is truly singular and always full of surprise. The only question is, ""Why hasn't someone given Louis Barnes the album under his own name that he so obviously deserves?"""
2838,1,One of the best short story writers ever,"Mr. Trevor's stories are heartbreaking in their simplicity and clarity. Most often, he dissects the illusions which enable people to survive--and which are so very sad. After seven or eight Trevor stories, you begin to wonder if it is even possible to be honest with yourself. In this age where fiction so often is reduced to description, Mr. Trevor still believes in writing about love and death, honor and betrayal, duty and neglect. His physical world is narrow--usually limited to small-town or rural Ireland--but his emotional world is limitless. If you want to know how short stories should be written, read this."
2845,1,True Family Pride,"A really really great book. A true page turner. Written in Mrs. Jackson's usual style that is uniquely her own. I strongly suggest you pick up a copy and after pick up ""The Savvy Sistahs"". (the sequel that tells Brandy's story)"
2846,1,Leave your sanity at the door,"Seriously - take this film for what it is, watch some of the best actresses ever chew the scenery and enjoy! Don't expect anything too profound - but watch the faces! Just watching Emmanuel Beart pout is worth the cost of the film alone. This is a film in love with the idea of woman but appalled at the reality. Understand that and all else becomes clear. I rate this as one of my top 50 films because I enjoy watching actors act with subtle changes in facial expressions - only the most skilled can do it (without resorting to stock expressions a la Keanu Reaves)and this film is filled with some of the best.Oh by the way of you are a fan of cheesy French Rock and Roll I deny you not too hum along to the first number. The UK DVD has the full version of this as an extra."
2853,1,Jessye Norman is simply unparalleled!,"Instead of referring to Jessye Norman as ""Diva"", we should refer to her as the ""Supreme Diva"". Her interpretation of French and German repertoire is unequalled. Miss Norman's rich, oceanic voice enraptures the listener. Buy this recording...you will not be disappointed."
2855,1,Excelent,"These earphones are fabulous! For my, noisy enviroments aren't a problem anymore. Once you put them on, you are the only one in the room! The earpieces are very comfortable."
2856,1,Bose knows,"my set of Bose QuietComfort 2 Noise cancelling headphones were purchased at a kiosk located in the heart of the Denver International Airport. i had heard of such noise cancel products and the use at the airport and on the flight were the perfect tests. this was over ten years ago the technology had only recently been made available to the public after years of perfection worn by pilots, maintenance workers and all who required phonic protection. The sound quality blew me away as i heard nuances in old familiar recordings i had never noticed and i could even run the vacuum cleaner without interference. The thing that really sold me was the genus of a design that allowed for the ease of replacement of the sound cord, the one part which always seemed to wear out or loss of signal because of weakened wiring, when meanwhile the speakers themselves are perfectly operational. Instead of losing an entire unit for replacement you can simply replace the cord. Perfection. Thank you"
2860,1,Great Band,"This band had a unique sound.I originaly got into this band because Kiss always mentioned this band as one of their favorite bands.As i am a huge Kiss fan,i am curious at time to listen to their musical origins.I knew Sunshine of your love and White Room.But the rest were not known at all to me.So i decided to get a copy of their best.Man i was not disappointed.Got right into it and couldnt stop playing it.Some songs seem to be addictive,probably recorded them on tapes made out of hippy weed.This collection is a must for fans of Clapton, Bruce, and Baker and the great rock of the late 60s. .Great stuff this,and i reccommend this band."
2864,1,"great book, worth the read for making bows","If you are going to make a primative bow, this book is a great read. The book is to the point, easy to read and gives you the knowledge needed to make your first bow. Although there are many books written on to make a primative bow, this book is one of the most recommended."
2865,1,Elli Review,"This is a really good book, it really brings to mind things that no one could have made-up, its just way too horiffic, but it DOES open your eyes to what power one man can have, and how people follow the majority, not standing up for others."
2872,1,ONE OF HIS BEST FICTION BOOKS!,"UPON THE CHORE OF MOVING ALL OF OUR STUFF TO ANOTHER CITY....I had the job of selecting the ones I will keep. When I came down to Till We Have Faces, I looked thru it till I realized that it was only one I had failed to read! So it will be my next read after unpacking!I have enjoyed the first few reviews here printed! I believe I have More C.S. Lewis than any other Author! It seems that my favorite ones have been The Four Loves, The Seven Storey Mountain, The Asian Journal, New Seeds of Contemplation, CONTEMPLATIVE PRAYER, DIALOGUES WITH SILENCE! AS I RECALL BEING IN LOUISVILLE, I DROVE TO THE MONASTERY OF GETHSEMENE and I saw the little house in which he spent time in Solitude writing.When I sat in the Choir for Morning Prayers, plus later in the day for other times of prayer, I realized the Power of Silence & Prayer connected to the litergy of Chants & Hymns! I surely returned to my Prison Chaplain's office with renewed Vigor!Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood"
2882,1,BATMAN TRULY BEGINS,"EXCELLENT!!! I wish I could forget all the other Batman movies, even the ones that Tim Burton directed. Although Michelle Pfeifer was pretty hot as Catwoman. If only ALL Super Hero movies were done like this movie. In my opinion this was even better than Spiderman. Even women that I know who don't like super hero movies love, that's right, LOVE, this movie. It is basically a character driven drama with action. And for once, the villains don't upstage the main character as they did with ALL the previous Batman movies. If you are looking for a Super Hero movie that has it all, look no further. THIS IS IT! I can't wait to see the Dark Knight this summer!!!"
2890,1,better than war of the worlds,This is the best movie so far of 05. With dissapointments to both star wars and war of the worlds I decided to go and see this. I was impressed in this movie. You get more of the story of bruce wayne training and learning to be a better fighter to then become the dark night. And don't listen to these other people because this movie is not boring. This has a story and it has great action. If you want to see a gret movie than go see this movie. Or if you want to see crap then listen to the nay sayers and watch fantastic four. But you won't regret watching this movie.
2894,1,amazing movie,"Great movie composed of an amazing story and good acting. Batman Begins is one of the best Batman movies up to its release and is followed by an equally enjoyable film, Dark Knight."
2898,1,I'll try to keep it short,"Ok, here it is in a nutshell, this is almost like a watching a Batman documentary, no over the top villians, no goofy sidekicks, just the complete origin of Batman. Very good acting and well paced, this movie is the polar opposite of Batman & Robyn."
2904,1,Batman is da Bomb!,"What can I say, Christian Bale is the best Batman yet! Remember when Clooney tried it?Hah! Buy this DVD here and save some bucks!"
2923,1,"it's better than batman,returns,robin,forever!!","but i think if you want dark,scary,violent get this one but i like fantastic four too but maybe they're just if you're in the mood for the OPPOSITE ok? so it's excellent and i like this but i like fantastic four too!!"
2928,1,IT BEGINS....2005!,"I've followed this film's production for a good while now. This movie will reboot the Batman franchise. The story will be a treat for Batfans non-Batfans alike.Judging from his interviews, Christian Bale is taking this role very seriously, even dedicated it to his father who passed away the end of last. This man will become the new embodiment of Batman/Bruce Wayne.June 17th everyone...it Begins!!!"
2929,1,Can't decide whether I like this more than TDKR,"I'm in the odd group of people who were not that into The Dark Knight. Christopher Nolan did Bruce Wayne very well. His Batman however, felt a little generic. It wasn't bad, just far less interesting than his take on Bruce Wayne. Batman Begins has more Bruce Wayne than Batman, which is a very good thing for me. It depends really. What do you like more? Bruce Wayne or Batman?"
2938,1,Confirmation that Christopher Walken truly IS weird!,"Great film. Walken is the only person who could have played this guy so genuinely. In my view, this is the weirdest, most convincing alien abduction film out there. Unsetling, yes. Go see it because it asks more questions than it answers, which is why we like these films, correct?"
2942,1,Fantastic,"Perry Mason Season 6 Volume 2 is fantastic and the wait for the next Season seems a long one. Beautifully restored disc and is giving great pleasure. Roll on the rest of the ""Seasons"""
2946,1,Great Book,This book is easy reading that takes you back to a simple time. Has a 1930's or 40.s feel to it.
2948,1,This is one of the best books I have ever read!,"As a librarian, I am always looking for books that appeal to a variety of our clients, as well as, a book that I will enjoy. This book is absolutely wonderful! It moved me by the strength of Charlie Kate and weaving of the tale of war, romance and a coming of age for Margaret. I have read this book 3 times within the last 4 years and the ending always moves me to tears. This is a fabulous book."
2958,1,Beautiful Bible.,This Bible by Thomas Nelson is beautiful and simple to understand. I recomend it to the Religious.Nelson Villamor y Fleitas.
2961,1,instrumental doesn't have to be boring,"Nice to hear a band that doesn't depend on vocals--this music is impressive of its own accord. Very entertaining album, with a little something for everyone--surf, jazz, blues, exotica...goes over great at parties. Excellent guitar work."
2964,1,The Roots of Reiki,"This book is a ""must have"" as it takes the reader to the Shinto/Japanese spiritual roots of Reiki and where Reiki comes from. This book has become my Reiki bible and has deepened my practice. When you perform the exercises, as specified, the energy is undescrible and so very spiritual as it takes the participant to another place and space. If you purchase no other Reiki book this is the book to have."
2969,1,"Excellent product, excellent price","I purchased this amp to power my outdoor speakers but it would also be great for a simple indoor system. Good,solid quality,excellent sound!! I would highly recommend."
2970,1,Works great for surround amp,"Using as the amp for surround back channels, sounds good, running cool. Would suggest this for anyone needing auxiliary amp."
2971,1,Making the Invisible Visible by Keith Devlin,What a wonderful book. You just have to read it and then you will understand.
2975,1,Hallelujah!,"This was the first in the series, and i was ""hooked"" until I finished book#5. Amazing Bible based fiction. I was so encouraged when I saw the characters ""come to life"" with Ms. Autens' literary skills. Recommend all five as a very good read and study."
2979,1,Fabulous,"This was the first Lynn Austin book I read, and I could not put it down. I quickly read the following books in this series. This first one started out difficult to read, simply because of the subject matter, and almost a year after I read it I still think about it from time to time. Even if you are not a fan of Biblical fiction, I would still highly suggest this book. Well done, Lynn Austin!"
2980,1,Exciting!,"This novel grabbed by interest from the very beginning and held it to the last word. Gods and Kings is a beautifully written action packed story. I recommend it to anyone interested in history, religion, action.... its a great read!"
2983,1,Great Book!,"I loved this book, did not want to put it down. I really enjoy Francine Rivers books and this was very comparable to her series ""Women of the Bible"". Can't wait to read more!!!"
2988,1,Riviting!,I could not put this down. The story put biblical events to life and kept me on the edge of my seat. This is a must read! Can't wait to start the next in the series...
2993,1,Great,M.C. Beaton is my favorite author - I have all of her books - I so enjoy Agatha and her exploits - please write more
2994,1,"Out of print, but excellent","Five faces of darkness is almost as good as the original movie. While lacking the print quality of the original, it is excellent in content. Appearences by Trypticon amoung others, is very interesting to the dearest of fans. It's all here, the origen, and many other interesting stories. Although this cinematic masterpiece is no longer published, I wish it were, having watched it. AJauasataian, a awesome transformer also makes an appearance."
2997,1,Great find,I was surprised to even find this battery. I have had my Bayco rechargeable light for years and one of the batteries is failing so to find a replacement for it was a very good thing. You have to love Amazon for the variety of items it sells. The battery was shipped quickly and works as advertised. Thanks Amazon!
3002,1,recommended for all beginners,"There is a little detective in all of us, but in most cases one wouldn't know where to begin. If you are curious about possible existence of paranormal phenomenon this book gives you that place to start. Whether a skeptic,a believer,this book gives the information needed to begin simple investigations in a manner that is easy to understand. For someone who hasn't had years of experience in the paranormal, or criminal investigation some of the books available can be intimidating. Mr Southalls book however makes you feel that doing your own investigation is within abilities. This book is not perfect, but it give an excellent starting point for the novice to begin investigating from."
3004,1,Brilliant cellist,"This is truly exciting music. Played with passion, this arrangement explores little known Slavik and Eastern European music. The ensemble between the cello and piano is faultless and the richness of the cello sound (played on an 1733 Testore) makes the album memorable. Karen Kaderavek, already a well established cellist, will go far."
3005,1,"""Post"" is a true masterpiece, showing Bjork at her finest.","""Post"" is Bjork's most outstanding effort to date. Much anticipated to follow in the success of her previous release ""Debut"", ""Post"" has emerged with new and different experiments in sound. The magical blend of dance beats and strong classical instruments like violins and cellos, sets this artist apart from all others. The powerful tracks of this album, are extremely versatile, resembling big-band, orchestral pieces, and funky techno rhythms- yet it is all Bjork. With her extraordinary vocal talents, it almost wouldn't matter what she had to say but we are thankful for the grace and poetry of her lyrics. Bjork is like no other and this album is a true musical experience."
3012,1,Outstanding Reception,"I bought this radio on the basis of online reviews promising outstanding reception. I need to get good reception on a relatively weak local station. I've tried several other radios that couldn't do the job, most recently a Sony that looked great, but could not detect the desired station. The Receptor distinguishes between adjoining stations and brings in the program crisply and clearly. It's also nicely compact."
3032,1,William Powell Myrna Loy Collection,What could be better than a set of great movies from two great stars!This is a wonderful collection. I hope more sets like this are on the wayfor those of us who love good movies.
3042,1,"If it is heard, then it will be a classic.",Duval and company knock out something special on this recording. An improvised theme runs throughout the cd the leads the musicians into fascinating and terrifying solos. Pyramid finds some new and interesting territory that fills a space between improvisation and modern 12 tone classicism. Under the Pyramid should be destined to be a modern string quartet classic.
3045,1,A great beginners guide,"As an investing novice I know very little about the financial world before reading this book. Now I understand a great deal, and have a lot more confidence with my money. Through a mixture of wit and wisdom, Tobias entertains while he educates about the wild world of money. This is truly the only investment guide I will ever need."
3050,1,The book would make those who demonize China unhappy.,The book stays almost unknown in the U.S. only because it provides solid evidences of how aggressive India was. It is an offense to those see China as a demon and India as an angle of democracy.
3059,1,THE ALBUM TO HAVE ESPECIALLY NOW....CLASSIC,"With all going right now with the posibility of a War, this THE BEST OPTION TO HAVE FOR EVERYONE TO LAID BACK AND ENJOY SMOOTH, SOULFUL,STRONG AND MAGICAL MUSIC AT HIS HIGH POINT. This is clearly THE BEST R&B; ALBUM EVER MADE. R.Kelly just put out here ALL HIS HEART, MIND, VOICE AND SOUL TO IT. You will love every song on THE CLASSIC ALBUM OF THE MILLENIUM...TP-2.COM. From the first track to the last one. YOU PEOPLE DOESN`T KNOW OF WHAT A CLASSIC PRECIOUS ALBUM ALL ARE MISSING.THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE R.KELLY,as said in the ""One Me"" Sensual Love and Sexual Beautiful Ego song.GO GOOOOOOOOO NOW...AND BUY 5 COPIES OF THIS MASTERPIECE GEM."
3069,1,"Mstislav, Yo-Yo, move over","How has so much of this incredibly beautiful music escaped my attention for so long? I knew the Saint-Saens and the Rachmaninov and one of the Faure pieces, but the rest were totally unfamiliar. On this disc, Han-Na Chang brings this rarely heard music out into the light of day, and renders both the unfamiliar and the familiar with superb tone coloring and deeply felt interpretations.This is simply the most beautiful and moving cello playing I have ever heard. It's going to spend a lot of time in my CD player."
3073,1,Wish I'd had it years ago,"I bought the EZ Can Crusher and Recycler 4 years ago. I love it. Wish I'd had it for longer than the 4 yrs. I have. It's easy to crush the cans flat, and they fall right into the collection bin. I have the bin lined with a plastic garbage bag, so all I have to do is pull the bag, close it and off to the recycle center I go. No mess. For years I used a can crusher mounted on a post on the patio, and had to crush the can then drop in a plastic garbage bag, then move the bag to an out of the way location and do the process all over again until I had the bag full. No more. This unit is all self contained. Hard plastic receptable, easy to clean, durable. If this one ever wears out, I'd definitely want another."
3078,1,A must for any serious alternative history buffs.,"I have a collection of over 6,000 books,and I have to say that this book is the best book I've read in ten years!It is absolutely riveting.Be prepared to read it one go,you won't be able to put it down."
3083,1,love,love these shoes. no trouble with purchase. fit just perfect. love these shoes. love this brand. love this color. love
3085,1,So very black,"I own 5 pairs of Converse sneaks, my daughter has 3 pairs, and my son has 2 pairs. We all really love our Chucks. But this is my first pair of the low top kind. I love them so much. They are really comfortable and easy to slip on and off, and so very black so they go with any kind of casual clothing well.If you're buying Converse for the first time, be aware they run just a touch big. This is wonderful for my son who has fairly wide feet, but the rest of us usually buy a half size small."
3088,1,great!,"a great shoe, buy a size below what you usually wear. comfy, durable and a great casual look with jeans."
3092,1,Classic,Chucks rock! Got these to match with my 2 and 4 year old boys. They love when we all put our chucks on together. These never go out of style.
3096,1,My distant cousin,"I loved this book, because it is about a relative I had never met. I have met his son, tho"
3097,1,good,"Thank you, this item was exactly what I wanted it to be. It is a good purchase on my part. thanks!"
3108,1,Adult Children of Alcoholics,This is a great refresher for individuals who suffer the effects of living in an alcoholic home.
3109,1,This is banging,"This is how i usualy shop for cds i hear or see the video then if i like i buy the cd When i saw the video for the song chop suey i was impressed. S O A D has a metal / harmoney / guitar thing goin on and i was really feelin it. we all know how some artist have that one good song and the rest is trash. thsi is not the case here. The rest of the cd shockingly good but chop suey is still the best. The bottom line is this: if you liked chop suey then what are you waiting for buy it now. trust me, you wont be disappointed."
3111,1,WICKED CD!!!,"One of the best cd's ever!!!!!serj's voice sometimes annoys me so much (when he screams), but not to worry cuz its still a wicked cd!science is a boring trackif i were yall id take a listen to forest, ATWA, aerials,chop suey, prison song,deer dance, you wont know what its like if u dont listen to the whole cd!if u were a true soad fan u would LOVE this cd, and if u werent then listen to the cd, give it a try, who knows wat could happen after!!!!!ATWA ROCKS!!!!!!!"
3112,1,Toxicity- Intelligent Punk Metal,"Toxicity is easily one of the best releases of the year, in any genre. System of a down has taken heavy metal and interlaced it with melody and arabic influences to create an entirely new and different sound. It is heavy metal, so the faint hearted may find it a little hard to get past the sheer heaviness of the album. Daron and Serj's lyrics are at times very direct (""Prison Song,"" ""Deer Dance,"" and definetly ""Bounce"") and at other times quite mysterious (""Toxicity,"" ""Chop Suey""). Overall, a great album. They showed heaps of promise and their excellent but occasionally poor debut, and delivered on every sliver of it. Very highly recomended. High points on the album include ""Chop Suey!"", ""Prison Song,"" ""Aerials"", and ""Shimmy."""
3114,1,COOL,"Awsome cd...almost evry song is worth listening to...prison song,pogo,and chop suey are all realy good."
3116,1,i don't mind the political statement,as a conservative I really liekd this cd the songs where really cool and yes they did express a liberal view of America but you can't just look at one side of an issue and System of A Down brought up some good points I loved Areals and the Prison Song
3134,1,Toxicity Towers Over the Music World,"Rarely does a band like System come to the forefront of the underground metal world. They have struck gold (maybe even platinum) with their sophomore album, Toxicity. The amazing creativity behind the minds of Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian are nothing short of godly. The spellbinding blend of political messages and energy-driven music gives the listener an amazing new view of the world. Really! ""Prison Song"" demonstrates as such. ""Science"", my favorite song on the album, also gives personal views and provides insight into the mind of Tankian. Though i cannot even compare it to their first album, Toxicity reigns near the top of the best metal albums ever! No lie."
3135,1,great cd,"i love this cd! i especially love Chop Suey. Recommendations for this song- Play on the bus to any field show or field tip, the results are usually reaaaallly funny. bnu 4evr."
3136,1,Best metal album I own!!,"There is one thing wrong with this album and that is it made me like their s/t effort less. Although there is no 'Sugar' on this album it is pure quality from start to finish. The only song i don't love is Jet Pilot because I think its a bit too heavy in all the wrong ways but its still a good track. Best songs for me were Chop Suey, Forest and ATWA.I reckon Serj is the main reason that SOAD are a brilliant band rather than just a good band but every member pulls their weight. In short a modern day classic."
3140,1,A Great Book,This is a great book about the life of John Wayne. I think that any fan of his will be pleased with the way it was written. One of the best books written about his life.
3151,1,Good Stuff!,"Eventhough Vince Clark sucks at writing some songs on this album, it is still one of my faves. If you're a die hard Depeche Mode fan, this album is a must have."
3169,1,Crowes ROCK on this album!!!!,"I saw the Crowes live at the Aregon in Chicago before I heard the album and they cooked. I bought the album and it was like I was still at the concert. Great fans, great album. Chicago loves the Crowes. I can't wait to see them again May 8th."
3175,1,Ben Franklin,"It is nice to read a book about one of our founding fathers, it is truly an amazing story of Ben, I encourage you to read it."
3180,1,Life changing book. Turns slacker into scholars.,"This book changed my life. I read it while in college and it changed my slacker attitude to that of a scholar. Franklin was a great man in his time. The reviewer ""barnesgene@aol.com from Fairfax County, Virginia"" is very wrong and a bit snobbish. He does not pretend to be the greatest writer, but Franklin utters the importance of self-knowledge and learning. From a boy to an adult his life story is a grand representation of the scholar in all of us."
3186,1,Learning from a Master,"The joy of reading this autobiography comes from the personality of its writer, as Franklin discusses Franklin. His style is delightful and he feels present, here, now. His body has been dead for over two hundred years, but not his ideas and not his voice. The core of what he writes is strong, but his ideas and rules for living are alive and speak to the present. Before reading this book, I read a few harsh comments on both the book and Franklin. Writers said that Franklin falsely portrays himself as a fine guy and that he really wasn't so fine. I cannot believe that the writer of this autobiography was anything other than the voice that comes across the centuries. Such a strong and vital voice, such a story, such deeds, these could only come from a great man. Not a perfect man, but a great man. I enjoyed so much the library checkout that I immediately got on Amazon and ordered the book for my own library, to read and reread, learning and connecting with the author."
3187,1,"best ever,(so far)","This is so far the best book I have ever read...no where else will you get to experience a truly amazing, real life story that will push you to research more on the topics of genius men and women and their thought prosses."
3188,1,Excellent experience! Would buy from again.,Excellent experience! Book as described. Good price. Quick ship. Well packed. Would buy from again.
3192,1,Every Smokers need with Newer Cars,"Every Smoker should have at least one of these. New cars don't come with ash trays anymore but they seem to have plenty of cupholders. It slip easily into any cupholder, front, back, or way in the back (for mini vans) where smokers get ban to with an open window. The closing lid helps to extinguish anything not completely put out. The lid prevents spills or messes (when lid is closed) if knocked over. The unit is easy removed to move to another location plus ease of properly disposing of contents. It can be used as a ""stand-alone"" unit so you don't have to look for a place to flick your ash or put out butts. High quality materials used in its costruction and has a nice appearance."
3205,1,"Worked, when others didn't!","Edit* Sorry I wrote this while I was a little excited the first time so let me reword it.Anyways. I had tried many other products to remove a wart that was growing on my thumb in a place that was very noticeable. I couldn't even caress my fiances skin without bothering her with it's roughness. This worked when others didn't. It was funny since I had tried everything from burning the wart off to cutting it off and then burning the wound, so that the wart wouldn't come back. That was after I tried too many over the counter meds that didn't work. This worked for me an it might for you. It's awesome that the wart fell off with this product, after it had regrown back so many times in that same year!PS. I mostly used it 3-4 times a day and covered the spot with duct tape, every time.Be careful though, it looks just like chapstik. Your kids might put this in their mouth thinking it is!"
3212,1,It's Just Perfect!!!!!!!!,This book is perfect in every way. I won many singing and instrumental competition because of this book. It's chords are accurate in all of the notes. Thanks The Corrs for the book. You guys always rule!!!!!!
3216,1,DVD edition will be available soon!,"This is a great movie,and it was one of the movies which heralded the arrival of ""NOUVELLE VAGUE"" which used ""jump cuts""(Godard used the skill in ""A bout de souffle""),""location shooting"", ""improvised dialogue"". Moreover,he used ""long shots"",so the movie was experimental,and it is still enjoyable now. The story of the movie is still interesting,and see the final scene. I hope DVD edition which will be released on Oct 9 by a notorious studio ""Fox Lorber"" will be a great edition."
3217,1,Great Bible,"This Bible is great! Great translation and good size. It's not a pocket Bible, but it's not a giant book, either. It's more like a regular-sized softcover book. And the new chapter introductions are really nice, very informative and useful."
3219,1,Know exactly where to place your shot,"I have used this book on helping 1st time hunters on elk, and bison make the shot that will cleanly take the animal. It shows both external and internal views so that you can understand why and where to place your shot. A must have for new and old hunters that want that one shot one kill record."
3220,1,Must Read,For anybody who is presently hunting big game and all those who are thinking about it should make this book a must read. It really helps you to understand the anatomy of the animals you are hunting and prepares you to make more of your shots Kill Shots. Excellent reading.
3222,1,Keeps my little one entertained,This house is bigger than i thought it was going to be. it keeps my child entertained for long periods of time. this product came with a few plastic balls but not nearly enough to fill the main hut. i suggest you purchase an extra bag here or at your local wal mart. Overall i love it (not nearly as my daughter does)and i do not regret my decision in buying this product since it keeps the little one busy.
3230,1,Great photos,"I bought this book as a gift for a friend, but ended up sharing it with various family before wrapping it up. It was also the hit of the party when it WAS opened. Very entertaining and a book easy to pick up and look at more than once. A hit for golfers or those who enjoy a photo with a message."
3236,1,Surprisingly Perplexing...Even for Adults!,"Not just for the kids...this thing is smarter than you think. I keep it in my purse to play with while waiting for a table at a restaurant, or waiting anywhere, in the car, RV or at home. The only problem that we encountered was when the sun or light is shining right on it, it is hard to read the screen and sometimes the dots go out, but for the price, it can be easily ignored or replaced. We thought that we could trick it by answering ""NO"" to everything and seeing what it came up with...and it answered ""Nothing!"" That was the truth! We did not think of anything. We then tried answering ""Yes"" to every question and it answered ""Everything"". This thing is very surprisingly smart. It occasionally does not guess it correctly, but usually it is how the people are answering the questions that determine the outcome."
3243,1,I'm addicted,This is a great stocking stuffer. Once you start playing you won't be able to put it down until you stump 20Q!
3245,1,GET THIS TOY FOR EVERYONE ON YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST!,"I must say this is the funnest toy I have played with in a long time. My son, who is 8 got this toy and he played with it for hours. His Dad and I played with it for hours! We ended up buying the larger version for everyone on our Christmas list, both kids and adults! It takes a very simple game and turns it into hours of amusement. It is amazing! Order one now!!"
3249,1,"Fun ""car"" bed","This wooden ""car"" bed has been a hit with our toddler son. He hasn't had any trouble adjusting to it from a crib, and he hasn't had problems with rolling out of bed. A previous review that I read mentioned that the sides of the bed were hard and/or hurt, but this hasn't been a problem for our son up to this point. We have had the bed for about a month and have had no trouble with it."
3251,1,The true essence of a modern day story teller.,"So you want to start somewhere? Make this your first stop. Paul Kelly is the one artist all Australians will come back to. No matter where you are, or how you feel, the music is timeless. Forget the charts-with more accomplishments than any other he is up there, standing next to 'TheDon'."
3253,1,Thought provoking with good ideas,"I have really enjoyed reading this book. It is packed full of information. For example there are sections on personality types and problem solving approaches, as well as sections on creating teams from disparate personalities and the challenges of building teams.I found this book thought provoking and a good introduction to a wealth of information on sociology issues in software development. People issues are important in team development of software, and most of us will have to work in teams for a large part of our careers. The bibiography is large, good for following up on topics of particular interest.I don't expect to use everything in the book, but will pick and choose what is appropriate in each particular situation."
3256,1,Trini tricks,Ever try to make those recipes from home and had to start over. This is a wonderful guide to help you make those meals from St. James and others. Cannot go wrong.
3265,1,"""One of the best!""","This book is really touching. But for those of you who would rather rent the movie, your missing the point of reading and the plot. Read this book, you'll be sorry if you don't!"
3276,1,Beautiful,"This book is so well written that you feel like you are living next door to the Nolans and sharing their life.You hope success finds this family, and smile when it does.I really enjoyed this wonderful classic, and will read it again someday."
3279,1,Soul Gripping Story,"This is an incredibly amazing novel...which i believe is actually an autobiography of the author. In ""A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,"" the reader is taken through an incredible path of the main character, Francie Nolan's life. From the death of her father, to her assult in a dark hallway, to this amazing girl supporting herself into college, this book finely illustrates the transition from girl to woman. This story takes the reader back to a childs perspective, and also helps one to remember to take time to appreciate the smaller things in life."
3281,1,this book reminds us of pride in self reliance,"I read this book for history and curiosity, I discovered our lost pride as a society in self reliance and perserverance without government or charity handouts no matter how poor. It's a lesson for all of us today, told in wonderful prose and unvarnished detail."
3289,1,Now one of my top 100 books!,"I keep my favorite 100 books on a shelf next to my computer. After reading this touching, bold, honest biography, I had to bump another book to find a place on my shelf for Smith's gem. It is one of my all-time favorites. R.K. Tipton"
3290,1,It's reputation is well deserved.,"This was a surprising selection for my book club. I had seen the movie years ago and thought it okay. The book describes a period of growing up in difficult times with wonderful use of words and descriptive phrases not dated at all. This is, yet again, a case of the original book being much better than the movie! It is well worth a visit."
3291,1,Couldn't put it down,"I read ""Joy In The Morning"" as a teen, but this one just didn't make my reading list until now, in my 40s. What a great book. I had just finished reading Angela's Ashes and I'd thought, that even though the books are 60 years apart, and one was written by a man about a boy, and the other by a woman about a girl, they were quite similar.They both drew me in and held me. It's incredible to me when an author can touch on something as unpleasant as poverty but not weigh you down and depress you with it. You aren't horrified by it and unable to finish it, and you aren't gobbling it up for morbid thrills as if staring as you pass by the scene of an accident. You come to admire the characters, and dread the last page.This is one that will always be on my shelf."
3293,1,The best group from back in the day!!!!,This is one of my favorite albums from my childhood. A real classic.
3294,1,A great toy,My two year old son loves the climber we can not get him off it he would play there all day if he could. It is easy to put together it only take around two hours.
3301,1,Great!,"The t-shirt was perfect for when my nephew went to the hospital to see his little sister for the first time! It was soft, comfy, and adorable! The shirt was shipped and recieved very fast!!"
3302,1,A well-done blueprint to personal and financial success,"Just got the book and couldn't put it down! The combination of writing personality, practical tips and Stephanie's personal story of tragedy and triumph make this a must-have book."
3308,1,The best,"So far, this is my favorite post-apocalyptic series. It is truly POST the apocalypse. Ths is what I enjoy: finding out what comes next. This series is inventive and well-written. if you stick through to the end of the series you will feel great satisfaction if the post-apocalypse is something you enjoy reading about. This series has just the right balance of zombie, zombie explanation, zombie science and survival. Some authors waste too much time explaining how we got here. This book offers us just enough explanation to enjoy the story of what comes next."
3309,1,"Functional, practical and looks nice","I have tried many different ways to store my very large array of shoes and this product is the best. It holds many shoes and takes up very little space in my closet. This is actually the second time I have purchased the shoe tree as I decided I needed another one for my other closet. It is very easy to find the shoes I need as the rack revolves and displays all of the shoes nicely. One can adjust the different tiers to accommodate different styles of shoes - pumps, flats, flip flops and varying heights of heels. Easy to keep clean and the base is solid. I have tried other brands [ from Bed, Bath & Beyond] but they were flimsy and the entire tree kept falling over as the base was not solid enough, so buyers beware of these cheap imitations! I definitely recommend this product- get a few!"
3313,1,Great use of vertical Space,"It is nice to have found a 4 tier tree to stack the shoes vertically - I have lots of ladies heels and the spacing seems to be sufficient between the tiers. I don't revolve the rack that much, but when I do, it seems to be very fluid. I have it standing on carpet and it does have enough stability that I am comfortable with - no problem. I think this is a great tree that allows me to keep way too many shoes!"
3314,1,Great space saver,"I bought this to replace my over the door shoe organizer. I hated those plastic pockets holding dust and dirt, and they were causing some shoes to lose their shape. I put this shoe tree together myself in about 20 minutes. It saves floor space by organizing the shoes vertically, each tier spins, the shoes hang great without being squished inside a pocket, and the whole thing can be moved out of the way if needed. Great shoe storage option!"
3323,1,One of My favorite things,"Live the smell of this perfume, I always get lots of complements when I where it. It's hard to find in the stores and this is a great price and fast shipping."
3334,1,"""Never Mind that the Water Is Poisoned!""","Well written, and realistic. Thomas is a well-meaning but rather tactless environmentalist. His brother Peter is more concerned about Thomas making a fool out of himself than trying to fix the situation. Just like in real life, there are no easy solutions but there are plenty of alibis and irrational negotiations from politicians (""If you'll just take back what you said...""). The only friend Thomas really has is the reader."
3340,1,Death Du Jour,This story started off as all of Kathy Reichs do and as I got further into it the more intriguing it be came and I still could not work out who the Leader was until near the end.Again an excellent novel that I could not put down.
3341,1,"Honest, Attentive Bookseller","The product was actually in better condition than described, arrived before the promised delivery date. I will use this bookseller again."
3347,1,And God created the foundation series.....,"This must be one of the most imaginary and brilliant books ever written. Not only exciting to read, but also an excellent plot, especially for all the fans of the complete works of Asimov."
3348,1,A fitting end for asimov's Foundation series,"This book fulfilled my expectations of a grand finale for the Foundation series. I was captivated by Trevize's journey back to Earth; exploring planets that Asimov had written about in previous novels. The parallels of R. Daneel, Gaia, and God were very imaginative and intriquing. This was one of the more enjoyable Asimov novels to read."
3350,1,Cosmic Goodness!,"I prefer to read the work with all of its crossovers contained, but Infinity Gauntlet completely stands the test of time. Starlin created a masterpiece. he handles all of these characters with aplomb, and you can feel your heart racing as the climax is reached. The only drawback is that George Perez did not draw the entire series."
3357,1,Smells like awesome!,"This stuff is great! Not only does it smell good, it feels great and lathers up nicely.Oh and it is doing wonders for my feet, which have a history of being dry n flaky and not super awesome to look at.With any luck, and the continued use of this, my feetsies shall once again see the public light of day!"
3361,1,Good Shampoo you can't find in most pharmacies,"If you get past the smell, this is a great shampoo to get rid of fungal skin problems in your hair. The smell is quite strong, but it seems to really help, so that is what is important."
3363,1,"Oh, the TEXTURE of it!","I liked EYEWTKAS not for the lyrics (which I actually thought were sub-par), but for the interesting musical soundscapes the rest of the band created. This CD is even better in that sense. From the first five seconds, in which a guitar riff moves from one speaker to another, you know that you are in for a musical odyssey of heavy riffs, frantic drumming, and frequent change within songs, a journey that increasingly few bands can take you on nowadays. Probably the best description of this work would be ""Dillinger Escape Plan goes emo."" If you like complex, intense rock with frequent tempo changes, get this CD right now. The only songs I don't like are ""Cosmopolitan Bloodloss"" and ""Ape Dos Mil,"" the first two singles. Oh well, maybe they'll get some emo kids to stop listening to their other music... and get some taste."
3367,1,The Transall Saga,"This book is not the usual Gary Paulsen book. But it is the best one of his I have ever read. It is about a boy who loves the nature, and hits the jackpot when his parents let him go backpacking across the Magruder Missile Range.He finds a mysterious blue light. When he aproaches it it transports him to another world. He struggles to get back to his parents. At first he does not think he will survive and get back to his parents. But his journeys show that he is more than skillfull to survive this world. At times he forgets what is importantand struggles to get back on track. It is a very good book about a boy and his struggle to get back to his family."
3372,1,Love James Burke,"Burke is one of my favorite authors, I have read everything he writes, I am now rereading some of my old favorites on Kindle and I would highly recommend this to readers who appreciate great ""visual"" writers who put you ""on the scene"", Burkes books are dark, violent, moody with great indepth character studies, unexpected plot twists, eccentric but believable personalities, and dialogue that is brilliant."
3378,1,brings out the romantic in me,"These are the romantic songs I grew up with and that is why I bought this CD. If you need a ""shot"" in the romance department, one or more of these songs should do it."
3384,1,Great for core understandings,"Very good read - for the acolyte who's background is not in physics but interested in the topic, this books was great for me. Some of the supporting proof seemed a little weak, but heck, I'm not sure I'm qualified to dispute it.I'll read it again - that's the best recommendation that I can give."
3388,1,Superb text!,"In my University years, I must confess there was any other issue in the Engineering career capable to match (in what difficult concerns) than Dynamics. I consider that this isolated discipline is the seventy per cent of the whole difficultness in the Five Years.Harry Nara was my beacon in the darkness, his polished concepts, kind presentation, fundamental exercises and that easy going conciseness and accuracy at the moment of solving ""heavy problems"" , constituted to me the friendly hand that saved me from the waters.Go for this, I still use it in my Consulting Timing ""to help"" the new students generations."
3392,1,"My ""New Millenium"" Kids Even Love This!","My 4 sisters and I constantly listened to this album (yes, vinyl!) as children, and Marty Robbins was our pretend boyfriend/handsome prince whenever we played. (We almost re-enacted ""El Paso"" fighting over who got to be Felina.) I had forgotten about it until I heard ""El Paso"" played at a local fair. My children (son age 7 and daughter age 5) were mesmerized by the song. I still remembered every word, and I ordered the CD for a road trip. My kids listened to it over and over, and I so enjoyed singing along again. Marty is truly the best country music singer/composer of all time. I bet my kids grow up and pass this along to their children."
3397,1,This Masterpiece is the greatest album in Country-Western history!,"Marty Robbins / Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs (bonus tracks CD): In 1959, the U.S. was crazy for Westerns (Movies, Television, Toys, Clothes and Music). In that year, Marty Robbins recorded this album which not only turned out to be the greatest County-Western album of all time, it is an album that stands besides the other contenders (in Rock, Country, Folk, etc) as one of the Greatest Albums of All Time. Some of these songs Robbins wrote, while others are covers and still more are traditional. The total effect is a moving Western fantasy unequalled in its brilliance. This album is Highly Recommended.This is a Masterpiece album and it deserves a Sixth Star."
3398,1,Walk down memory lane,"I had heard El Paso on the radio, and, just had to have the whole album!! Great sound and quality..."
3400,1,"I'd like to take a Big Iron,","and use it on the talentless, commercialized, white trash trolls who call themselves ""country"" singers today: that idiot Trace Adkins and his hip-hop country rap crap, and Kenny Chesney et al- you guys aren't fit to shine Marty Robbins's boots. Marty is the real deal- great voice, talented guitarist, master lyricist. This disc has a great Western feel- my personal favorites here are ""Running Gun"" and ""The Master's Call."" Put this in your CD player and hit ""play through""- there isn't a bad song on here. If you're a fan of the ""Honky Tonk Badon-kadonk"" and other CMT video crap, you best look elsewhere. I hear Wal Mart has some good CD's by a talentless asshat named Garth Brooks."
3405,1,One of the most important books of all time,"The American experience has given to the world two priceless things above all: the fullest development of the idea of the worth and dignity of the individual life, and love and value of wilderness for its own sake. Desert Solitaire is a monument to, and a celebration of, both. It is one of the most important books of all time, for in it is the evolution of human conciousness. I'm grateful to Ed Abbey for his book, and for his encompassing, inspiring vision of the American West."
3406,1,The book is as rare and precious as water in the desert...,"I've been there, the vast, silent desert. I thought no book could transport me back there, such an unworldly experience as it was. But I underestimated the power of Abbey's language. His muscular style, vivid descriptions, left me with pictures in my head, smells under my nose, sounds ringing in my ears. While some books make you feel like you're tackling a mountain, or headed towards a destination, Desert Solitaire successfully echoes the meditative, yet ruthless quality of the desert. His views about the protection of natural beauty are passionate and infectious. It can make you think twice or thrice about the fruitlessness of our petty, material lives. I plan to enjoy this one over and over, as I would a favorite song"
3407,1,"One man, alone, in the land he loves","In this fascinating ecological memoir/rant, Abbey takes us along during his time as a park ranger in the heart of Utah's harsh red rock landscape to expose its beauty and contradictions. While some things have changed since the book's publication in 1968, the majority of Abbey's thoughts and experiences remain timeless. A true classic of environmental nonfiction."
3408,1,"Back in print, August 2000","Mouritz,London, has brought out a new edition of the Universal Constant in Living, F.M. Alexander's last book.Edited and annotated by Jean Fischer, whose editions of 'Man's Supreme Inheritance' and the 'Articles and Lectures' collection have raised the standard for the serious study of Alexander, this promises to be a MUST for teachers and students of the Alexander Technique.The book is a sort of footnote to the earlier books, there is some problem with sprawl. But Alexander never wrote more clearly and succinctly."
3410,1,What a great CD!,"This CD is really amazing. The songs are so powerful and are sung just beautifully. In response to ""A Music Fan from Israel,"" I'd just like to say that the CD's subtitle is ""Songs of the Spanish Civil War,"" not ""Songs from..."" and I'm sure that the title was not meant to be ""decieving."" ""Pasiones"" is a wonderful mix of languages and I enjoy the contrast between songs about the War and songs that were sung by the soldiers. This is a really wonderful CD."
3419,1,A great classic!,This a wonderful classic that is worth watching during the holidays! A child and her grandfather develope a wonderful loving bond. A refreshing family movie!
3420,1,great kids movie!,"After being totally dissapointed by the Emma Bolger version of Heidi, I purchased this one. It was beautiful. Sweet, innocent, funny, even a little sad. All the characters did an excellant job. Children don't need high paced drama to be impressed. They giggled and wiggled over parts such as Heidi milking the goat, the monkeying around, and the sleigh chase near the end. And don't forget Andrew trying to milk ""Bearly"" either! I am a mother with six children. We all loved this movie. I would recomend it to anyone who wants a bit of innocent entertainment."
3423,1,"Ah, Shirley Temple!","What a beautiful little story! My girls LOVED it, and I really appreciated the G rating. Definitely a must-see for the whole family!"
3437,1,Shibby!,"Dude, Where's My Car first struck me as a cheap... movie that a couple of teenagers made in their spare time; that was, of course, before I watched it! Not only do Jesse and Chester make you laugh your toes off, but they also have a sweet, semi-innocent look about them. Dude, Where's My Car is like a stoner version of Dumb and Dumber and is one movie that I'm going to have to add to my collection!"
3439,1,The eye-popping true story of how raucous and undisciplined American journalism once was,"Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism is the eye-popping true story of how raucous and undisciplined American journalism once was. Feuds, partisanship, and outright lies often colored journalism of the era. Some founding fathers, such as Ben Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and Sam Adams, were leading journalists, others, such as George Washington and John Adams, passionately disdained journalists; and Thomas Jefferson was a skillful manipulator of journalists. Infamous Scribblers is divided into three sections: ""The Role of Authority"", ""The Approach of War"", and ""The Tumult of Peace"", all tracing the contentious relationship between the founding fathers and journalism throughout the birth of America. Highly recommended for American history shelves, and an absolute ""must-have"" for public and college libraries."
3442,1,give him his props,"Little Walter Jacobs doesn't seem to get the respect he deserves. Let's fix that right now: it says here that ""Hate to See You Go"" is one of the top five blues studio recordings...ever! First off, there's the huge, steely sound of Little Walter's harmonica, amplified (he was the first in Chicago to do so) and drenched in lonely reverb. Then comes the biting lead/rhythm guitar of Walter's pal Muddy Waters, along with primitive, powerful drumming. This is a fine set of songs, very diverse by blues standards, mostly written by Jacobs or Willie Dixon. But best of all is Walter's vocal approach: raw, primal, but controlled, full of personality. He emotes the pain of a Robert Johnson or Billie Holiday, and the aggression and power of Muddy. This is a must for anyone with even a passing interest in Chicago Blues."
3451,1,"So far, the best CD of 1999.",An amazing recording. Congratulations Moby; thank you for the moving music and for the enlightening essays.
3455,1,It was all good. Full of excitement and ready to jam.,"It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. It was all good. Oh yeah, it was all good."
3456,1,amazing work of music,"i bought this cd used, just a few weeks after it came out (i guess someone didn't like it, their loss). i hadn't heard much of moby's stuff other than his dance-y material but this was a welcome surprise. it's musical beauty permeates your soul and fills one with goodness (i know that sounds cheesy). moby does a wonderful job with the voice samples he uses and his mellow, slow instrumentals are his best yet (i favor track 14, everloving)."
3463,1,"Syd Barrett, RIP",Syd Barrett will be greatly missed. His whimsical songwriting style was unique and greatly influenced many famous musicians like David Bowie. This dvd is an essential purchase for those wishing to know about a genuis.
3464,1,Substantial,AWOS was the first fiction novel that I read that I fell in love with the character. Emma Harte is a terrific heroine. One for the ages. I read it over 20 years ago and I have never found a novel to compare. It's not the easiest book to read and I often had to pick up a dictionary to search for a word. Nevertheless it is a wonderful rags to riches tale. I will never forget this book.
3467,1,Works fine,This unit works as advertised. It was easy to install. I had to buy a 4 pin molex to SATA adapter because the 3 SATA connectors supplied would not reach all my drives. It runs very quite.It is worth the money.
3468,1,CASTRO 'S MUSIC IS ANOTHER MODERN BLUES SIGN POST.,THIS RIGHT AS RAIN ALBUM IS ALL GOOD. CASTRO'S GUITAR PLAYING IS TOP SHELF. LIKE HIS OTHER ALBUM THIS MUSIC WILL OPEN ALOT OF YOUNG MUSIC LISTENERS EYES AND EARS TO THE BLUES. THIS ALBUM SHOWS WHERE BLUES WILL BE GOING IN 2K.
3470,1,plantronics Bluetooth 665 charger,This charger is great for times when you don't have access to your computer. I would highly recommend it for those who travel frequently.
3476,1,A must for any one who has ever worked in a cubicle!,"This movie is a classic. Mike Judge, the man who brought the world ""Beavis and Butthead,"" surprizingly brings us an increadibly clever, fun, and a ""God I wish I could do that"" movie. Every one who has ever worked in an office will see this movie as the gospell. People can associate with every character in the film. Ron Livingston, also a bit part in ""Swingers"" was a wonderful lead. He plays the ""stand up and fight the man"" role to perfection. Well done, fun, and a must have in any DVD collection. Well worth the money, and something you'll watch over and over and laugh each time."
3478,1,Hilarious movie,"I love this movie. It was on Comedy Central a few times a week one summer and I watched it every time it was on.Like Dilbert, it has something any office worker can relate to but will still be funny regardless of where you work"
3487,1,It's funny cause it's true!,"I haven't been in the work force for too long, but there's so much in this movie that i relate to. The sick thing is that so many of the gags are so dead-on to reality; you don't know if you should laugh or cry. If you work in an office (unfortunately) you will know all the characters in this movie. My last boss definitely had a good dose of Lumberg in him. All of the main characters are solidly funny, and it doesn't hurt to have Jennifer Aniston as the love interest. There's a moderate amount of harsh language and a naked girl on a TV for about 2 seconds, but nothing gross or in exceptional bad taste. Final Note: It might help to see ""Superman III"" before you watch."
3490,1,One of my 2 Favorite Comedies Ever,"The other being ""Better Off Dead"". It's witty, it's hilarious, and appeals to the GEN-X group."
3496,1,One of the funniest movie's ever,"I was sitting home bored one day when I happened to catch this movie on cable. I couldn't believe this gem was overlooked in theatrical release. Talk about hilarious. After watching this movie I went out and bought it. It's that funny. Being a person who worked in a situation similar to the one our main character, Peter Gibbons, worked in I could totally relate to this movie. Made me laugh and laugh. All the characters are funny. Great comedy."
3501,1,great movie,"So funny; and it gets funnier each time you view it. Goofy plot, but has lots of ties to the reality of the workplace."
3505,1,"Vintage Vonnegut and much, much more!","In Mother Night, Kurt Vonnegut gives perhaps the most humerous(but still respectful) view of the Holocaust and Nazism ever thought up. As he always does, Vonnegut pushes the envelope of what is acceptable and while doing that makes us ponder if we're acceptable. WOW! I haven't yet seen the movie, but I can't wait. Even Hollywood couldn't screw up this astounding peace of literature."
3507,1,Everything one would want.,"This is not a classic KV book in the sense that there is no science fiction element, but everything else one has come to expect from KV can be found. Even in such a serious book Vonnegut finds a way to add his dark humor without disrespecting his message. And as usual Vonnegut offers an original perspective on a topic that is commonly used. Any Vonnegut lover should make sure that this book gets entered into their library. This may not be Vonnegut's best (my opinion it is Cats Cradle) but it is still an incredible read. My only problem is the same problem with most of his books; they are too short. It always feels like he has so much else to say, but I guess we cannot get greedy. This is a book for everybody."
3512,1,very addicting game,it is a great game which in many ways feels like a metal gear solid meets resident evil 4 arcade stealth shooter and is very fun and hard to put down once you start playing
3514,1,"Watch out Goldeneye, you've got a good rival.","This game is the best spy game in a long time. In Goldeneye, the enemies just stand there and shoot at you hoping to hit you. Not in Winback. The Terrorists will wait for you to show your head and then blow you away. And, Goldeneye's dudes will shoot at you if they see you or not. Winback's will wait until they see you. Winback: Covert Operations offers an exellent training program to teach you all you need to know how to do in the game. The ""Crying Lyons""(the terrorists) show some artificial intellegence. Winback's multiplayer mode isn't as great, but offers more ways to challenge one another. Overall, if you were to buy Winback or Goldeneye, go for Winback. Goldeneye is horrible compared to Winback."
3528,1,Like it a lot,"This is one of those oils I would buy again. It smells great, nice to put on after you shave your legs or just rub on to smell nice."
3530,1,Amazing fit!!!,"I have never, ever, ever in the history of owning my Prius found a sunshade that didn't fit like crap. My hat is off to these guys. It fit like a glove."
3531,1,"Brilliant, moving, helpful to family members","If you're looking for a way to help a mentally ill relative, you must read this compelling book and its (equally compelling) successor, ""Transforming Madness: New Lives for People Living with Mental Illness,"" also by Morrow. No, don't just read them. Buy them; tuck them away in a visible, dust-free spot; pull them out for inspiration when your relationship with your relative falls into a pothole. Big Neugie and Little Neugie will help pull the two of you out of it and go on with your lives together."
3532,1,Perfect Fit,"This came well packed, and is a perfect replacement for my 1999 Ford Explorer. Fits and looks exactly like the original!"
3533,1,great,"great quality love this show as good as I remembered would recommend this to anyone.love this all time classic, I watched this as a kid and it stuck in my memory as a funny good tv show and my memory was right"
3534,1,F Troop The Complete First season,I found seeing F Troop for the first time for years.It was great to see it all again.I enjoyed it so well it brought great memories back to me. The transfer from the film to dvd was excited !! .It worth seeing over again. I be looking forward to see F Troop the complete second season when it comes out.Highly recommended.
3542,1,When Wolf knew how to write,This book sums up New York and the criminal justice system. Don't waste your time on A Man in Full. Wolf lost the gift after Bonfire.
3548,1,"""Boomer-Man"": Tom Wolfe's Modern Everyman in Bonfire Hell","If F. Scott Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby was the Modern-Man of his generation, Tom Wolf's everyman hero in ""Bonfire of the Vanities is our Boomer man,"" the guy who can't quite make ends meet on 998,000 bucks a year. Although Wolfe is best known for his ""new journalism"" stethopscopic view of America in works like ""Electric Acid Cool Aid Test"" and ""The Pump House Gang,"" his first foray into the land of the novel is novel indeed.Bonfire is a hybrid of novel and journalism with a pinch of Woody Allen. Wolfe's ""social X-rays"" scavenge cosmopolitan Manhattan cocktail parties as the vultures of the downtown poverty industry exploit a yuppie faux pas that sends his Boomer hero into a crashing Sartrean abyss.Angular as a spaghetti Western, zanier than Monty Python, and truer than Sinclair Lewis, Mr. Wolf's excursion as a novelist leaves us wondering why he doesn't do more."
3549,1,Shades Of Purple,"I think this CD is the best CD I've ever listened to! Especially Mirror Mirror. I love the piano playing! I'm a piano player, so I should know."
3557,1,"A+ for 25,000 IU Vitamin A",Very good price for the stonger dose of Vitamin A I look for which are not always easy to find without visiting a health store with overpriced products. This is exactly what I want and I am VERY pleased to find it in the dosage and price I was looking for. Expiration date of 10/2015!
3561,1,Mere Christianity is a Winner!,"This was the first book by C.S. Lewis that I read. I have now read about 10 of this great author's works. In my opinion it is a must read for everyone; Christian or non-believer, it says it like it is. At times when I am having trouble explaining things to my friends that are consumed by the secular world, I purchase this book for them as a gift. If they are still confused about a supreme being after such a read then I would question their comprehension or desire to learn the truth. Once you begin to read this book it is very difficult to put it down; it is a catalyst for intellectual thought and enlightenment.Dr. Long"
3562,1,Review of the Complete C.S. Lewis Signature Classics,"I had read two of C.S. Lewis' works- Mere Christianity and the Chronicles of Narnia-and wanted to read more of his books.This book is great in that it contains some of classics like the Screwtape Letters, Miracles, etc. in one edition.I have not completed the entire work yet, but have enjoyed what I have read so far. C.S. Lewis is one of the intellectual giants of the 20th century and you will see why when you read some of his literary masterpieces contained in this edition. I recommend it highly."
3564,1,An excellent defense of the Christian Faith,C.S. Lewis (my favorite non-fiction author) has written an excellent defense of the Christian faith. This book is the foundation for modern apologetics. A must read for Christians in a modern intellectual society.
3569,1,Beautiful as only simplicity can be,"This book is truly astonishing. It explains the concepts that lie at the heart of Christianity with amazing simplicity and clarity.I have found it to be a true treasure, a book I am certain I will return to many times over.C.S. Lewis is masterful in his poignant honesty and colourful metaphors."
3574,1,"What we, as Christians, believe (in a nutshell).",Read it for the second or third time and it is always amazingly new. I plan to go to a seminar this summer at the Kilns (Jack's home near Oxford) so I wanted to get back up to speed. Also recommend George Sayers' bio of Lewis.
3575,1,Attractive Edition of a Classic,I am grate for this beautiful edition of this classic. I gave new copies to my children. Knowing that the wonderful text will be well preserved and presented for a life-time of enjoyment and inspiration is a real value.
3576,1,Merely . . . Phenomenal,"If you are honestly searching for answers, then you have found the ultimate book. This book isn't for the feint at heart, it's not for bubble-gum churchgoers, and it's not for people who have no desire to objectively search for the Lord. I was totally blown away by Lewis's intellectual examination of Christianity. I had never seen anything even remotely close to what Lewis has done. Lewis's arguments are so unique that you will be left wondering, ""How come nobody ever has addressed these issues in this way before?"" It's almost like the Lord gave Lewis a unique gift to appeal to the intellectuals who are on the fence. If you are on the fence, then Lewis will push you onto the right track (if you are willing)."
3580,1,Titles can be misleading - This book serves a great purpose.,"By ""mere"" Christianity, Lewis means that he is writing about the fundamental issues that all Christ-based religions can agree upon. It is written in a conversational tone, with few references to particular bible verses. An outstanding work. This was written 50 years ago but is timeless and accurate today."
3583,1,The definitive essay on why Christianity is the one choice to make,"C.S.Lewis has the ability to teach us why Christianity makes sense and why God Himself, makes sense. In words we can all understand he lays out the various reasons to accept Christianity and why it is right and intelligent to do so.As a previous Athiest, his commentary on why we should believe as he does is even more umnderstandable as he takes it from concept to certainty. Very well written by a very smart guy. Written during WWII in England it is also a commentary on the war, in some parts, in relation to good and evil.Another book that should be read by all believers and non-believers alike is ""I don""t have enough faith to be an Athiest"" written by Norman Geisler and Frank Turek. For the believer it is all you need to make sound arguments for why you believe and for the non-believer I challenge you to continue in non-belief after you read the definitive evidence in these pages."
3590,1,Review of Mere Christianity,It might be helpful for some skeptics of orthodox Christian teachings. I like it because it doesn't come on strong like some Christian apologists books. Tom Dougherty
3592,1,C.S. Lewis is Brilliant,I don't know if he could have possibly covered all the ground he did in any fewer words. It is incredible how he goes from assuming you believe in absolute nothing to getting down the heart of Christianity in a matter of pages. I also like Lewis b/c he often gives credit where credit is due. This book shall stand the test of time.
3593,1,Great book,I've really enjoyed reading this book. The Great Divorce is what turned me onto reading C.S. Lewis and also hearing him quoted by some great preachers. He knows his stuff and presents it in a way that even a reader with just a basic education can read and understand. Anyone looking to dive a little further into their walk with Christ will find this beneficial!
3594,1,C.S. Lewis is amazing,I find his works to be amazing even after my third or forth read through. I cannot not think of anybody else who is better in the field.
3604,1,great perspective,This was my first C.S. Lewis book and I found it so interesting that he approaches the Christian faith from such a straight forward and practical perspective- especially him previously being an atheist! Very interesting.
3605,1,An Eminently Logical Case for the Christian Faith,"Mere Christianity is one of the two best logical logical cases for the Christian faith I have read. Lewis first brilliantly lays a foundation, logically showing that the universe (external and internal) demands logically that some form of God exists. He then compares various theories of God with what we find in reality, and finds that only the Christian one honestly stands. At this point, he continues into details of the Christian faith. Any one honestly seeking to understand Christianity, and/or trying to decide if it is true, will find a powerful, rational case here for ""yes."" The other book I mentioned is Charles Colson's How Now Shall We Live, whose conlusions are based on real-life studies and experiences, rather the more pure logical base of Lewis' writing. They are two halves of a whole perspective, the theory and the application, and I would especially suggest both to any Christian reader."
3607,1,Practically handy,"In times when the morality and the common human sense seems to be in decay due to the relativity subjected to these concepts, Lewis, in an understandable way and with a variety of examples, elucidate the reality of right and wrong hidden in the human being exposed as the Law of nature. With that, as a start point, the author give sense, in many ways, to the human behavior and clarify why the christian moral is the most proper way for a person to live."
3622,1,You have to like Ben Stiller to like this movie,"but if you do, this is one funny movie. I couldn't stop laughing from beginning to end. The humor is stupid, but in a sort of intellectually cynical way. Stiller is over the top as the owner of the megagym, and deadpan Vince Vaughn sets him off perfectly. This is a great movie to watch in a group!"
3628,1,It's a Fit!,It's perfect. Purchased one that was supposed to be for a Prius but it didn't fit the way this one does. I'm so pleased I'm going to purchase the one that goes on the back now. Thanks.
3643,1,Don't Let Today's Barbra Stop You From Watching Yesterday's,"To those Celine Dion fans who don't understand why she will never quite equal Streisand in the eyes of many of Barbra's fans, I present exhibit A: Funny Girl. I was 15 years old when I first saw this film and fell in love with Barbra. She simply wowed me. Bounced off the screen with her presence. And that voice! Just an extraordinary talent. Yes, she's become a bit out of control and beyond full of herself as the years have gone by. I can't sit through Mirror Has To Faces and some of her later films. But show me Funny Girl (or The Way We Were) and I'm that 15 year old again who fell in love with ""The Greatest Star."" If you have never seen this movie before, don't let biases that you might have formed against Streisand in recent years stop you. It is really, truly a must-see. She more than deserved that Oscar! (Something I guess Celine still has on her To-Do List.)"
3645,1,The Last Best Star Plays One of the First,"How appropriate that Streisand brought this role to us. She appeared on the scene just after the end of the great musicals and great musical stars, so it is no surprise that she is our connection to those movies and that time. Her performance as Fanny Brice, though lacking much connection to the reality of Brice's style or life, also bridges the gap between old time and new style musicals. The emotional, idealized treatment of the material suited her talents perfectly. In my opinion, Streisand's closing number in this film, ""My Man,"" is what clinched her Best Actress Oscar. Also in my opinion, it is one of the three most electrifying moments ever caught on film. (Judy Garland's ""The Man that Got Away"" from ""A Star is Born"" being the second. I'm still deciding on the third ...)"
3650,1,"Great--but, unfortunately, largely overlooked--work.","Perhaps the fact that this great work receives so little attention is indicative of what ails education: educators focus their attention on all the latest drivel concerning education while only paying lip service to Dewey, who remains the highest-ranking educational philosopher. It pains me to hear and read bungling educators mindlessly parrot Dewey's catch phrases (e.g., ""learning by doing"") while pushing educational doctrines completely antithetical to Dewey's ideas. Dewey had it right, but is grossly misunderstood by the bozos who vapidly regurgitate his words and phrases. In other words, I recommend that you go to the source.If you are in any way concerned with or interested in education and happen to stumble upon this lonely page, do yourself, your kids, and/or your students a favor and study this book carefully; It eclipses all other books on education."
3667,1,Farbareware Classic Cookware,I enjoy my Farbarware Classic cookware. It heats up fast and even. I like the stainless steel-clad bottom much better that the old aluminum-clad bottom. The stainless steel bottom is much easier to clean off tuff grease stains if you have to you an oven cleaner. I lost all of my Farbareware cookware to Hurricane Katrina and have replaced it. needed.
3671,1,Practical and insightful,"This is a really practical and insightful work of John Piper. It helped me a lot to rethink my behavior towards God. This book is in fact an answer from God for my prayers, then I really needed to think about the importance of Joy in my life."
3677,1,HDMI or HDMI ?,This HDMI cable is a good quality one. Even If I have never seen a bad quality HDMI cable. It does a good job connecting my Xbox 360 and DVD player to an HDTV.
3687,1,Great Movie even still..,I remember as a young child going to the movie theaters with my family. Seeing this movie brings back so many memories. I remember feeling scared for the Unicorn as well as hoping that everything would turn out good. I am really glad I was able to find this movie on amazon. Great Movie!!!!!
3688,1,Mystical,"This movie meant so much to me, because I remember it from when I was a child. I am so in love with the way the cartoons were drawn. I also love their responses to the questions and task they are asked. There truly is no other movie like it."
3693,1,The Goodness that is Unicorns and the Movie about Them.,"I love this movie. My grandparents had it at their house when I was little, and they would let me watch it sometines when I came over. It is of no little amount of sentimental value to me. I love Unicorns, and I always thought that the way this movie ended was a beautiful way to reaffirm the magik in life in a world that has altoghther forgotten it. Again, a beautiful thing. (...)"
3703,1,A true Classic,"One of the best cartoon movies of the 80s. If you have a child or want to go back to your days as a child, then this wonderful cartoon will bring back those golden moments. Also, if your pagan, this is one of the better movies on the list !...Highly recommended !"
3704,1,So far so good,"I haven't watched this DVD yet because it's a present for someone, but it arrived sooner than expected and the DVD is in priginal packaging so it should be perfect. :)"
3705,1,An Unforgettable Timeless Classic!,"I have seen this movie countless times since I was a little girl, and it has never ceased to amaze me. I have also read the book, and the movie follows it quite well. The music is spectacular, and sends chills down my spine every time I hear it. It is the story of a unicorn who is in search of the other unicorns, to find out what happened to them. Along the way she encounters both friends and enemies, and disguises herself as human to get past the Red Bull and free the other unicorns. it is an enchanting tale, one both children and adults are sure to fall in love with! I never get tired of it!"
3708,1,It's the BEST!,"It ranks right up there with Legend, Labyrinth, and Sleeping Beauty as all time best movies. It's scary, beautiful, and breathtaking."
3714,1,Awsome!,"This was my favorite movie when I was younger. Now I'm in college, and my friends and I are sititng here drinking beer and chilling with ""The Last Unicorn""! I will always love this movie....it will always be a part of me, and it can be a part of you, too!"
3716,1,moly this,"4130 tube steel takes to diamond paste for hi luster fine ,moving parts inside tube such as carbon fiber piston}"
3721,1,Heartfelt and brave,This book is heartfelt and brave and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Stacy Lewis is an amazingly wise and gifted person. And Java is an amazing being in a dog's body! The two of them were destined to meet to inspire all of us to be more conscious in our relationships.
3742,1,Awesome!,"This is the perfect lip gloss, shiny, and stays on forever! I highly recommend this product to anyone for an all day gloss."
3743,1,"My favorite color, brand","This color is perfect by itself or over any color- it does a great job toning down colors that are too bright. I have one in every purse, in my drawer at work and in my car!!"
3747,1,OUTSTANDING!!!,"I have two girls, ages 4&amp;5. When I read them this book, we all cried together. Max Lucado's, ""The Crippled Lamb"", has got to be one of the finest children's books I've read yet. With it's vivid descriptions of the poor lamb's feelings, and the message of how God turns bad situations into blessings. Thanks to all who worked so hard to put such a wonderful book together. Daniel Oxford, Gravette, AR"
3752,1,Delicious!,"Informative AND charming... I just learned three new cooking techniques! Loved Julia Child's shows when I was little (in the 70's), but I had not seen the original show (starting with the beginning episodes.) What a treat! This is a must watch for me, and, I suspect, anyone who aspires to become a more accomplished chef."
3763,1,this is the best film ever,this film uis the bvest film i have ever seen the music is so fun and the story is great and so magical. I love the cindrella story and i feel thatthis film expands the story in a very successful way. My favorite part of the film is where edward finds cinderella on his horse. It is so romantic i didnt realise until now that you could get it on dvd but i will be ordering it straight away.
3765,1,"""Suddenly it happens, and the dream comes true!""","""Wonderfully, beautifully it happens and your world is new,"" says Cinderella in this long awaited film, which is FINALLY being released in its entirety -- the full length, British version! This wonderful, lavish musical of the story of Cinderella, stars Richard Chamberlain as the Prince, Gemma Craven as Cinderella, and a wonderful cast including Annette Crosbie, Michael Hordern, Christopher Gable, Kenneth More, Margaret Lockwood, and Dame Edith Evans. The musical score is brilliantly written by the incomparable Sherman Brothers, who also co-wrote the script with Director Bryan Forbes. This is a great film for all ages, and sure to be a perfect addition to your movie collection."
3766,1,One of the Best,"As a child the Slipper and the Rose was always on at Christmas on television in the UK. I used to love watching it.I have now moved to New Zealand and they haven't heard of it! I have been hunting for the film for ages, and someone got me in touch with Amazon. Within a week of ordering it, it arrived and I have already watched it twice.A wonderful movie that will go on and on. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good pick me up and oh Richard Chamberlain is yummy in it!"
3768,1,These Guys Deliver Quality RocknRoll,"I am a Djay for a comeback radio show. It's always hit & miss checking out all the comebacks of older bands. This one was a big positive surprise. I like their sound now better than in the 60's, with the exception of the masterpiece""The Letter."" The first 4 tracks of this album are super. Wang Dang Doodle is a great blues song that I liked by Koko Taylor and the Box Tops do a terrific version of it here. As I was listening to the album and enjoying it all I thought that the only thing I hoped they'd do is put a more hard rockin jam song in tthe mix, and then they gave me just that with the last track of 6 minutes called Big Bird. I play this album quite a lot and have played 9 of the tracks on my radio show. I've gotten very good feedback about the songs. The Box Tops are still touring and one more album would be nice. This is a great addition to their catalog of great music."
3773,1,Wonderful,Basil Johnson is a master story teller and writer. The legends are all deeply meaningful. He really transmits the spirit of the Anishinaubae in a vivid way. I hope he writes down a lot more of these haunting legends and that his hopes for the recovery of the Anishinaubae language and cultural traditions come to full realization.
3774,1,Fascinating,"I just wanted to add (to all of the other reviews) that, while the Dirk Gently books may not be as hilarious as the Hitchhiker's book (and at times verge toward drama), I would say they are much more interesting. The plots are complicated to be sure, at times esoteric and puzzling, and you may even have to re-read, but I find it is well worth it. Fascinating."
3779,1,This is one of Van Damme's BEST!,"I saw this movie earlier this year, very good effects, stunts, fights, characters, story, acting and all! The entire package is there! I would recommend getting this movie on DVD. Its one of Van Damme's BEST films ever."
3793,1,Refreshingly funny,"This show is hilarious without being obnoxiously or ridiculously offensive. It's refreshing that it can be humorous without offending half of the world's population. It is not a particularly mature show, but it's meant to be light-hearted and not taken seriously. Every episode will make you laugh out loud."
3795,1,Should be three books,"Three great essays, each of which should be a book by itself. I would love to have read much more about about the frightening religious fervor that permeates so much of American politics and which he describes so well. I often wonder what happened to the separation of church and state.We are becoming no better - or worse - than the third world countries, be they in the Arab world or elsewhere, that base their political, social and most frighteningly, their penal system on religious fanaticism. Of course they don't call it fanaticism. I perused most of the other reviews on Amazon, and it is interesting how members of the religious organizations Phillips describes are offended by the book. Well, what else is new!"
3797,1,Eye Opener,"This book will change what you thought you knew about gov't and special interests. Everyone thinks the gov't has always been controlled by special interests, but most don't understand how deep the connection is. And how long religion and oil(whale and from the ground)has controlled and steered this country from it's inception. This is not a politically motivated book, it's a ""history tends to repeat itself"" book. You will definitely learn a ton from this book. Top notch, but definitely not a optimistic view of the fate of the United States."
3798,1,Prescient,"Drawing on historical precedents, Kevin Phillips paints a stark picture of the U.S.A. in her twilight; overburdened by an outrageously large and growing debt, dependent on a diminishing resource, and blinded and misled by fanatical religious elements. This book should be required reading for all high school seniors - we may be able to ""dodge the bullet"" if enough Americans understood the situation - but, alas, this will not happen soon."
3800,1,"""Mr. President, Do You Believe We're In the End Times?""","That was the question the president couldn't answer in his press conference earlier this week. If you want to understand why he couldn't just say ""No, what are you, nuts?"" - the answer's in here.Highly recommended!"
3817,1,Original and difinative rock & roll-Nazareth,"Nazarteh, one of the only few whom is distinct, just hear the music and you know whose singing. Nazareth music is powerful but not with alot of ""noise"". Just plain good music, in other words just let the music do the talking."
3818,1,LoL Comedy,"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim was an amazing novel written by David Sedaris. I enjoyed reading this book from cover to cover. The humor was never ending. He took real life stories and told them bluntly with a humor that not many authors can match. The randomness of the novel was what made the novel unique. He talked about the little things in life rather than the big. He told about his family relationships, finding his sexuality, and growing up. The continuous culture shock that is David Sedaris's life was intriguing and hilarious. If you like roll on the floor comedy you will love Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim by David Sedaris.By: Kassie Forman"
3820,1,Very. Good.,"I've read half of this book and already know that I love it. It bothers me that everyone tries to label David Sedaris as a ""humor writer"" and then come to only expect him to churn out ""humor books."" Sure the books are funny, but a lot of his writing is deeper and serves a more significant purpose than trying to make someone laugh. Also, I like how he is a ""gay writer"" who doesn't just fit into the cookie-cutter by writing ""gay stories."" He branches out...and he loves to explore the psychological implications of situations from his past. Overall, buy this book, and buy Barrell Fever, and expect to laugh, a lot, but don't approach Sedaris's writing as you would, say, Bozo the Clown's work."
3822,1,What? Me funny?,"For self-deprecating laughs and family novelty, read this book. Sedaris is a master at it! You'll find yourself thinking of the funny things that have happened in your life and make comparisons."
3824,1,Who ever gave this less than 5 stars is an idiot,"I quote this book more than I quote seinfield. I have become addicted to it, to David's twisted use of the English language. I have read all of his other books, and I highly recommend his cds."
3836,1,Daughter in Law Loved It,My DIL loved receiving this as part of her Christmas gifts. I have had Farberware for 46 years and it looks as good today as it did all those years ago.
3837,1,Sanuk Sandal 5 STAR!,"The Sanuk Sandal is so comfortable! The description of the sandal, size, color and comfort was right on the mark. The sole of this sandal has a slight sponge however does not leave permanent foot marks. The fringe fabric strap between the toes is very comfortable and the sole on the bottom is constructed to conform to the bend of the foot when walking. Unlike some sandals which are bulky the Sanuk conforms to the foot and is true to size. It fringe is suttle and the colors are faded. As a surfer, this is one of the best kick back sandals I have ever own! I highly recommend this sandal. I purchased 2 pair just incase someone removes their shoes and borrows mine!!!!"
3844,1,Great for the preschool imagination.,"This is a toy that the 4 year old loves and plays with a lot. It has no moving parts and nothing he can take off the vehicle (he likes to remove the wheels and tractor treads from his vehicles). It is made of a rubberized plastic, but in my house that is not a problem. I prefer toys that allow the child to use his/her imagination and in my household this fits the bill perfectly. The quality of the toy was not an issue. There are more than enough details painted/stenciled on the shuttle to make it look realistic. This is our second shuttle. The first shuttle got destroyed when the puppy got a hold of it and used it for a chew toy. So my only warning would be not to let the dogs get hold of it. It is made in China."
3847,1,Prinze and Schroder deliver amazing performances,"I was impressed with the leads and this is a movie based on actual happenings. Prinze in one of his better roles and Schroder has never been better. the school shooting footage themselves might disturb a lot of viewers and it puts thoughts in your mind. Schroder is electric as the kid who was once a student at the school, comes back. Henry Winkler is great also as the police chief. powerful, violent to the extreme and a shcoking end that will leave you hanging."
3860,1,"A magnificent page-turner, wow!","This is by far the best book that I have read in a long time. A beautiful historic novel, couldn't put it down. Never a dull or boring moment, just flawless. Highly recommended!"
3864,1,Great fiction with a historical basis,"This was a wonderful book, hard to put down. The author very effectively blends historical fact with her own imagination of characters' motives and feelings. Very well done and enjoyable."
3868,1,Best book this summer,"I read a lot of historical fiction -- and more than a few about Henry the 8th and Elizabeth I's time -- but this was by far one of the best I've ever read. I couldn't put it down, and stayed up all night two different evenings until I fell sleep. Even knowing that the general outcome of Anne Boleyn, it was completely fascinating the way Phillipa Gregory developed every character in this book. Each person became alive -- good and bad, villain and angel -- so that you felt like you actually could see these people, hear them talk and knew them intimately. It's a tale about the human spirit, and a wonderful love story that is intricately woven in with a great deal of historical fact. Anyone who loved the trilogy about Josephine Bonaparte will especially love this story."
3869,1,The Other Boleyn Girl,Enjoyed the book. Easy to read. Read this book even if you have seen the movie. Gives you more details and makes you understand the time in history better. I highly recommend this book for leisure reading.
3870,1,"Loved it, sad it had to end!","I am such a huge fan of Phillippa Gregory -- and this book started it all. This historical fiction is exceptionally well-researched, and keeps you caught up in the sexy drama of the relationships between Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn & her sister Mary Boleyn, while offering some insight to the powerful family leaders trying to influence the king. Offers a beautiful feel for the period. Even though you know what's going to happen to Anne, it's a joy to read, and I hated for this book to end!"
3872,1,What a great read!,"Don't be deterred by its length, The Other Boleyn Girl is a worthwhile read. With this novel, the reader gets history, mixed with drama and adventure. As a reader, you grow to have true feelings for these characters, while you might know what historically happened to them.A fine novel!"
3877,1,A fascinating glimpse of history,"...but an even better story of a girl's journey to womanhood. Philipa Gregory's Mary Boleyn was a three dimensional character who sprang to life in the pages of the book. Mary Boleyn was her family's pawn, married off at an early age and tossed in the king's bed shortly thereafter. But as the story unfolds, Mary finds herself and finally has the strength to marry for love.Gregory's ability to weave a fictional story into a historical work was breathtaking."
3878,1,One of the best books I've read in a while,"The story of Henry the VIII is so convoluted that it can be hard to believe it actually happened. Based on historical facts, with the dramatic flair and touches of a true fiction novel, Gregory does a wonderful job bringing everyone back to life and depicting the relationships and situations that made Tudor England so memorable."
3879,1,A Very Good Read,"Being a junkie who loves to read about British nobility, I have found some books on the subject to be big yawners, much like college text books, but not this one. Philippa Gregory has a wonderful perception of the lives of her characters, which is evident in her writings. They have become more alive for me than with any other author.I would highly recommend this book and am looking forward to reading the others she has written."
3882,1,the Other Boleyn Girl - Better than the Movie!,"I initially picked up this book because I loved the movie. I immediately realized that this powerfully written book far eclipsed the movie. Set in the court of Henry VIII, this is the intriguing story of the Boleyn Girls, Anne and Mary. The characters come to life as they fight for the King's affection and advancement of their family. I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction."
3887,1,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!","Okay, so while you may not use this novel as a reference while writing a paper on English history, if you need a book that will keep you enthralled you have most certainly found it.The Boelyn family wants nothing more than to elevate themselves within the English social hierarchy. As players in the court of Henry VIII from a very young age, siblings Anne, George and Mary know how to play the game well. When young Mary catches the eye of the King while at court, the family, under the guidance of their ruthless uncle, meet to determine how to best use Mary to further the family's social agenda. What follows is a thrilling tale of love, murder, betrayal and sibling rivalry. Descriptions of the English court and the actions within will keep readers immersed and interested. The horrific exploitation of women and children and the social acceptance of it all is both riveting and nauseating. An excellent piece of historical fiction, not to be missed.DYB"
3894,1,A BLAST FROM THE PAST,"We saw this movie in the seventies and were blown away with Tamara Dodson's presence. I was excited when I found the movie on this site. I am glad we found it because when we need a seventy fix, it right at hand (You won't be disappointed). Outstanding movie. Thanks"
3899,1,Nice,"Great item. Easy to use, I didn't get any ink on my fingers or anywhere else. It really is simple to use. I've used other refill systems, usually just with a needle attached to a squeeze bottle,but this automatic refill system is so much cleaner and simpler. Once your ink cartridge is full the refiller automatically stop putting ink into it. The instructions don't say to, but when finished I put a small piece of tape over the fill hole. Give it a try."
3902,1,A must-have for any breastfeeding mother,"When both mom and baby are inexperienced at breastfeeding, the last thing you both need is to be fumbling around trying to get comfortable. The Boppy is just the right fit for everybody and there is no baby product that I used more than this pillow. If you're looking for a practical shower gift, get her the Boppy. Mom will use it 8-10 times a day and take it everywhere she goes!"
3903,1,I couldn't live without a boppy.,"The boppy has been a wonderful purchase. I actually have 2 here in the house, one upstairs and one downstairs. I use them every time I nurse, and my husband uses it when he gives our daugther a bottle. We also have 2 additional boppy pillows that were hand-me-downs. I keep one at each of the grandma's houses so I don't have to cart mine around. I find that the boppy luxe is well worth the additional cost over the regular boppy. The fleece texture and the velvety texture are wonderfully soft. The cover is extremely easy to remove, wash and replace. We purchased an extra cover to rotate with during washing."
3913,1,A Must Have For All Moms,This pillow is great for breast or bottle feeding. Comfy and soft and big enough to fit around my still swollen abdomen!!! The cover washes easily... I got mine as a gift and would buy one for any mom to be!!!
3918,1,This thing is great!,"Okay, so I'm not a nursing mother. In fact, I'm a dad, so I guess I can't speak from personal experience about the usefulness of this product for nursing. I do know that my wife loves it, though. And I even use it sometimes when I'm holding our son--I find that it is just high enough to set on my lap, and I can rest my arms against it and hold the baby without tiring my arms.The boppy has many uses, one of them being that you can put the baby in the hole in the middle and sit him up in a sort of reclining position. Our son finds this to his liking, and we often sit him up in it while he naps.Overall, this is an excellent product, highly recommended for moms (and dads)."
3919,1,nostalgia,This book brings back lots of memories for anyone interested in major happenings of the mid-twentieth century. There is something of interest for everyone. It is worth a look and makes a good gift.
3921,1,Prisoners enter the Hampton Court Flower show,"In a medium to minimum security prison in England, a new program is started to teach inmates how to garden in preparation for their parole. In the meantime, they make the prison grounds look nice. This is an unlikely group of gardeners, one short timer and three lifers, one of whom is dying of cancer. The four of them learn gardening from books written by a Ms. Woodhouse, who later hires them all in a sort of work release project renovating a garden in a local estate. There are many twists and turns and surprises, but the gardeners find their way to Hampton Court and happiness in the end. Helen Mirren, Clive Owen and the rest of the cast are perfect in their parts and the story is very good."
3923,1,This was so funny,"I saw this movie at a preview screening in L.A. and I thought it was amazing.... it was such a cute, original story and all the actors were great. Clive Owen (who was in Croupier last year) was especially good - he is going to be a big star. This is a movie for everyone who loved Saving Grace and Waking Ned Devine."
3930,1,A Great Read!,"I read this book a year ago, but I still remember almost exactly what happened. The book is burned into my memory. That's how good it was. It's a tale of a boy growing up, and the evil in our society. We see how the boys decivilize during their stay on the island, and degenerate into savage groups. As in Jack London's ""The Call of the Wild,"" the characters revert to their natural instincts. In this case, the boys become savage group hunters, similar to eary humans thousands of years ago. This book is hard to understand; cryptic, but will give you a new view of the world."
3939,1,A thrilling journey into the dark side of the human psyche.,"'Lord of the Flies' was written to show that no matter how civilized the human race thinks it is, it is all an illusion created for our own safety. We are all animals in soul, if not in mind. I was drawn into the book, I thought of the characters as real people, with real problems, and real personalities. I feared for the characters lives, for Golding's one-in-a-million writing style brought the story to life. 'Lord of the Flies' had to be one of the most believable books I've ever read. With an exciting, realistic plot; well-thought out characters; excellent imagery; and superb symbolism. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to see the hidden side of the human spirit."
3953,1,extremely interesting,"This book is quite interesting and does indeed depict society to a great extent. its point to the fact that given a small population isolated form external influences will bring out the primeval and basic instinct with which we are all born...in other words we revert to forming our own society, based on our so called strength at the time aka aggression. In ""polite"" society today this is largely masked and the aggressor does not literally kill the weak, but subdues, dominate etc by economic power."
3957,1,A great book which will turn you inside out...,"This is a great book with strong characters and a riveting story which evokes thought about life's rich, historical context. The characters are so real and well-developed they seem like you truly know them. Some are lovable, some are charming, and some may be detestable, but all are unique and interesting. The story is fascinating... set in a small village on a greek island where the reader experiences the village's sleepy existence, its turbelent military occupation, and the outcome of those (and other) events. The history of the island and characters evoke thought about life's rich, historical context. It shows how history shapes nations and races and how personal experiences shape individuals. Importantly, it also illustrates how each individual plays an important role in defining both the present and influencing the future."
3959,1,Absolutely Beautiful,"My Wife, Girlfriend at the Time, introduced me to this Album back in 1998. I remember she told me that she wanted to show me the most beautiful music that she had heard. When she played it for me I had to agree that it was indeed beautiful, I had never heard anything else like it. Soft Black Stars has never lost that for me, no matter how matter how many times I have listened to it."
3962,1,"great dvd we have viewed this dvd several times , and each time pick something new","we really enjoy this dvd and each time we watch we pick up something new, it was a replacement, and we are glad we reordered it"
3963,1,A wonderful insite to the mind,"I'm a HUGE fan of Baum.Always have been. Ever since I was a kid. Reading Baum in published order is an ever ongoing project with me. Now I'm not one who wants to take apart the wonderful stories and put all the elements into little boxes and find out what they are make of, but this book does something that is just the opposite. It takes the stories and looks at them in the order in which they were written! This book is a wonderful look at the ""periods"" in the Baum Canon. This is a great look at how say something like the Life and Adventures of Santa Clause and Queen XiXi of IX relate to each other. Great writing and research makes this book a MUST for any Baum collector."
3964,1,So You Wanna Be a Comic Book Artist,"This book takes you all the way from inspiration thru getting your meterial out there to be evaluated. Chapters include: starting a studio, tools of the trade, illustration tips and tricks, creating the characters, creating the story line/scripts, putting it all together, copy-shop comics, promotion and getting publicity for your work, submitting your comics to publishers, video game designing, sources and essential comic book terminology. The book is a complete source for anyone interested in pursuing the field, old or young--anyone."
3967,1,Numark PT01 Portable DJ Turntable,"Excelent product. I connected to my computer easily, could play LP's, 45's and 78's, has speaker; earphone connection, does not need pre-amplifier and once you get the music in your computer with a program like Audacity or DAK Editor you can copy, edit and put into Wave or MP3. Highly recommended for the price, if you're a high tech person this might not be that great but for must of us it works perfectly"
3969,1,A rare find,"I found this album only because it was playing in a local record store when i was there. I immediately loved it and purchased it that visit. This album has a very downbeat sound that is mostly instrumental. The lyrics that are included are very fitting and the music never seems to get beyond a pleasant, soft, and medium speed. With mellow and almost hypnotizing rhythms, it is perfect music to listen to in the evening, and mellow enough to sleep to. Apparently there are two good things out of Iceland."
3970,1,One of the CDs I'm really glad I bought.,"""Everything Is Wrong"" is my personal favorite of Moby's albums. It has such techno as ""Feeling So Real,"" such minimalist classical as ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters,"" and many more. It's one of the CDs that I listen to constantly, and yet do not tire of."
3974,1,Another road classic,A great gift for someone who is a huge fan of the road pictures. This is the last one we have yet to see and I am sure it will be great.
3980,1,Great book!,"The book essentially describes our three and a half year boy. The first chapter is almost a biography of him. We have gone through some of the same frustrations that other parents have had (especially with an incompetent audiologist). The book confirmed what we always suspected that our boy is a very bright and very analytical child (very good with computers, etc.) that just happens to be a late talker. We will have him evaluated by a pediatricain specializing in a development clinic just in case but we are convinced that there is nothing wrong with him. This is a great book!"
3984,1,College for Free,This book is an excellent choice for the parent and the student to read to get a good background prior to researching and writing good scholarships. The book was in excellent condition and the delivery was earlier than expected. Thanks to Amazon
3989,1,Best thing to remove coffee stains from your pot,"We bought a new coffee maker that came with a stainless steel carafe. After six months or so, the insides started getting dark no matter how many times we washed it. My wife tried vinegar and a bottle brush which helped a little. I remembered a product called ""Dip-it"" my mother used to use. I looked in grocery stores, department stores and specialty stores. No one had heard of it. I should have gone to Amazon.Com first.Following the directions on the box and letting the carafe soak for about 1/2 hour, it was spotless, like a brand new pot. I'm glad I opted to buy a box of 8. This is the only cleaner I'll ever use on my coffee pots."
3996,1,Excellent product,"If you are like me and hate your foot slipping to the front of the shoe, this product is for you. It also provides extra cushioning and works with pumps, peep toe, sandals, boots and sneakers mary jane style. I've used it for years and so far no complaints!!!! This product is available at drug stores but a much higher price (between $6.99 and $10.99). For me the affordability offered through Amazon is the cherry on top!! I recommend this product!!"
4000,1,Great messenger bag!!!,Bungalow360 makes great stuff! This whale bag was a great gift idea!!! They offer bags with different animals that are cutely designed!
4006,1,Weeds Season Four,"This wacky series of soccer mom, Nancy Botwin never seems to disappoint. Wildly entertaining."
4011,1,realy great show,"realy liked the show, was nice to watch when the boys where at school or sleeping, always kept me wondering what was next.!"
4022,1,Great buy,These mailers are a great value. They are thick enough to hold items securely and seal well. I would reccomend them.
4024,1,Replacement Cord,This cord has a straight plug into the back of the receiver. Much better design than original cord with 90 degree bend.
4029,1,100 Ways to Improve Your Life,"One could easily pass over this book by simply looking at the title. Chandler's suggestions will not just motivate you, if you follow them they can change your life. His suggestions are based on his own experience. He is passing on what has actually worked for him and his clients so his comments are rock solid. One of these suggestions is worth the price of the book"
4040,1,"Terrific plot and acting, wise and warm - a classic!","I never write raves. But this is a very underestimated film. The screenplay is spare and polished. The actors - sublime. Regina Case is amazing in this role. Should have won all kinds of awards. Completely absorbing. Best film I've seen in a long time.No violence, restrained sex - real life, with somebody you are really rooting for."
4048,1,nice,"I liked this. I read it twice & gave it to a friend to read. It had some surprising endings, and what I liked best was I didn't have to read through lots of details to get to them."
4050,1,Pravana Leave-In Treatment is a necessity for me.,"My step daughter introduced me to Pravana Intense Leave-In Treatment several years ago and I've been hooked on it ever since. I have dry, natural wavy hair that is frizzy when it's humid outside. Pravana helps control these frizzies. Several of the girls I work with complained of static when brushing their hair so I gave then samples of my Pravana. They too are now faithful users. Oh, and it smells wonderful!!!"
4053,1,wow really good songs,I didn't think there is any good rock coming out new anymore this new Saga cd is really good. well musicianships really good and the songs I was surprised how good the songs are. they are still putting out good music which is why nobody will hear it cuz if you have talent and if you play good it won't be heard. you play like you don't know what you're doing then you make money I'm glad I got this saga cd if your a fan of good songs good musicianship or saga you'll love this CD
4055,1,Through the Narrow Gate,"This book is very simply written but portrays the joy and difficulty of being a religious sister at the time this young woman entered. Since I was a religious and left, I found a lot of what she said helpful in validating my experience."
4074,1,warriors rule!,"I havnt yet read this book (and i cant wait to) but i read all the warriors books up to this one, and i enjoyed every one of them. Me and my friens even made up numerous names for ourselves and clans. i am Pinestar leader of ForestClan and Mintwhisper medicine cat of FroestClan. i love so many warriors characters such as Leafpaw, Sandstom, Sorreltail and more. buy this book and the entire rest of the series youll enjoy it!"
4078,1,THE definitive study of monastic life at the high tide of the Benedictine tradition.,"The most compelling feature of this relatively short book is its level of detail about monastic life at Cluny over two and a half centuries. I've read several books on the topic, and none match the granularity and scholarship of Evans' work. Why is this book out of print?"
4079,1,Best of the Year! alittle bit of everything,"Llanas's sings with so much emotion, every song is believable"
4080,1,Grammy winner - just needs promotion!,"Sam Llanas of Bodeans displays his immense songwriting talents - a personal album, but addicting, as the best music can be. Thanks, Sam & Absinthe boys (& girls), keep it up...."
4081,1,Sweet sword must buy,"i bought this same sword at the mall. it is a fine quality sword good balance, a fine piece."
4082,1,Bronson's Final Bow,"Charles Bronson gives his final performance as Police Commissioner Paul Fein in this very good telefilm. It may not be the best movie, but Bronson gives it his best and goes out in style. Highly recommended for any Bronson fan."
4083,1,first soundboming 2 now sway & tech,"99 seems to be the year of mix tapes first soundbombing two now this what next? this cd is phat from what ive heard. ive already heard the anthem, get you mad by Eminem, and Chino XL's joint and belive me ill be picking this one up."
4091,1,One of my favorite movies of all time.,"I'm a 22 year old guy, and I love this flick, it's great family fun, and Even I like it haha. It's got a ton of adorable animals and a pretty good story line. A must have if you have any kid under 13 years old, or just dorky kids like me!!"
4097,1,the best!,"suitable for wide span of ages, adults included... beautifully made. One of my favorite ""kid"" movies of all time! watch it"
4117,1,The only reference you will need for the exam,"I'm somewhat of a certification junkie (MCP, MCSD, SCP, and now SCWCD) so I've had my fair share of good and bad certification books.With a basic understanding of JSP and this book, I took the exam and broke the record for the highest mark at the testing centre.This is one of the few books that will likely get you certified without prior J2EE reading or experience. (Assuming you are familiar with J2SE)"
4119,1,A must have book for certification,"This is a best book i have read for a long time. A must have book for SCWCD exam. All aspects of an exam are covered throughly and in depth. I recently passed an exam just studying this book.The language used is very easy to follow and all examples are explained fully. I think it would not be wrong to say, anybody learning Servlets and JSP must read this book before refering to any other resource. I give 6 stars to it out of 5.Looking forward to some more good things form the same Authors. I will be the first one to buy."
4123,1,Awesome book - recommend for every J2EE programmers,"This is the best Servlet/JSP book I have read - I read so many other books but no other book duplicates the coverage and depth of this book.I passed the test using this book but I am happier about finding this little treasure. Currently, I am converting WebSphere to WebLogic application and I'm keeping this book right besides me. I'm refactoring this old legacy code and converting to the latest standard.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn servlet and JSP. It may be not for the beginners but definitely you need to have a copy of it if you are serious about servlet/JSP."
4125,1,Best Test Preparation Material for SCWCD 1.3,"This is not only a good book for SCWCD 1.3 exam, but also a good reference for web application development. I read this book thoroughly and took some mock exams available in the internet, then i appeared for the real exam. I got 98%. I would strongly recommend this book for customers to buy."
4147,1,Better than swiffer,"I have had no problems with swiveling the mop head, as another review had suggested. It does a fantastic job of dry mopping the kitchen floors, and wet mopping worked extremely well. Just some generic pine-scented cleaner, hot water, and the mop pad. When I'm done, I just toss the mop pad in the wash with the towels and it's ready to use again. Great for the environment and great for your wallet."
4148,1,microfiber mop,"This product is fantastic. For dusting, pollen, dog hair and everything else on the floor or walls this is the go to mop. Very wide head and mop head adheres to handle by velcro. Washes beautifully."
4155,1,Awesome candy snack,"Unfortunately I can't see to get these for some reason, but when I did try some samples around Christmas, they were super. I have been looking for a store that sells them without any luck. I hear I can get them from Japan, but at what price?"
4162,1,Excellent!,"This nine-part documentary is not only a history of the Jews, it's a history of the western world! Hundreds of thousands of dollars were probably spent in the production of this series. Abba Eban takes the viewer all over the world to examine one of the world's most gifted and intriguing people - the Jews. These tapes will not put you to sleep. The music and images allows the viewer to relive Jewish history. And consequently, come to understand the world we live in today much better. I know the tapes are pricey, but own this documentary if you ever have the chance. You'll never regret it."
4164,1,A fabulous soulful album!,"This album definately lived upto expectations. I also purchased some of the album for gifts and were received with great thanks, and the reivews I had back were very favourable. Definately worth buying!!"
4168,1,One of their best if not their Best!!,What an incredible CD. First time through it I loved it. But as I listen to it more and more I feel that its probably their best Album yet. In my opinion this band is one of the best they have been around for awhile and continue on putting out great albums. Their style is just to sweet. Lets hope they keep the great albums coming. This CD offers their hard rocking style as well as their softer ballads.
4178,1,Don't waste time buying anything else but this Analon Advanced,"I have waited about one year before writing this review to observe the performance of this cookware over time and.... I loved it the first time I used it.... and I still love it today ! This cookware is heavy duty and is a joy to use and clean. I love the nonstick both on the interior and the exterior, after 11 months of use, they look just like they did when I took them out of the box. This would be an excellent choice for the novice or the professional cook."
4182,1,"Steve Wozniak, Inventor of the Apple Computer","This book is perfect for a school book report! It is both interesting and easy to read. Though it is written for older children, it is sophisticated enough to be appreciated by adults. It includes many details about Wozniak and how he became involved in creating the original Apple computer. The author writes in an easy-to-understand style with touches of humor and details that make Steve Wozniak come alive as a ""regular guy."" Includes many black and white photos and a great glossary of terms."
4183,1,Great book!,"I have been using this book for several years and absolutely love to make gifts for my friends using the book. The recipes are easy. The book describes how things are to be stacked in the jar to look their prettiest, and the instructions are very easy to follow. My friends love the gifts. I have used the prepared jars for my own ""quick"" cookies and the cookies are delicious! I highly recommend the book."
4187,1,GREAT,SAW THEM LAST NIGHT IN CONCERT THEY WERE GREAT. THEY LEFT THERE WATERMARK ON ME WISH THEM ALL THE LUCK MAY GOD BE WITH THEM
4190,1,Terrific cooking tool. Makes cooking more fun!,"I bought this set almost a year ago, after having used a set of old-fashioned pots and pans for many years. These are a delight to use! Sunny side up eggs, which always stuck in the old pan and were often tough and rubbery, come out tender and I love just sliding them out of the pan onto the plate. I don't even have to use a spatula to loosen them. Even for food that doesn't slide out, clean up is really easy.I did take the time to not just read, but actually learn the manufacturer's instructions for taking care of them and follow them to a T. (My Dad taught me that if I take care of my tools, they'll take care of me.) So they still look and work like new.I enjoy cooking much more now that I don't have to worry about sticking. I'm more adventurous, because I know that even if the food doesn't turn out great, at least it won't be a hassle to clean."
4193,1,The Best criminal investigation show out there.,"This is by far the best criminal investigation show out there. The characters are very good, and the show never dies down. It's never predictible and there are so many twists and turns. One of the best shows out there!"
4196,1,Great series,"Great series, love it bunches. Purchased it for a gift. Arrived quicker than expected and was well packaged for protection."
4200,1,Great Purchase,"I was so excited to have recieved my DVD's of NCIS. I have watched all the episodes already, and I'm really happy with the condition and the packaging of the product. Really happy with my experiance, overall.Thank you:))"
4208,1,excellent introduction to Weber's work,"Gerth and Mills' reader provides an excellent introduction to Weber's life and thought. This edition includes excerpts from _Economy and Society_, the brilliant essays ``Politics as a Vocation'' and ``Science as a Vocation,'' plus a brief critical biography and material from other sources.Weber had so much to say about so many subjects that any anthology would require a well-considered method of organization; this book has that. It is easy to navigate. When I want to know what Weber said about a particular subject, I look in _From Max Weber_."
4211,1,the best slow movie ive ever seen,"A lot of these older horror films fall into the rut of being slow involving little dialogue with long stretches of setup for the messes, but I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE manages to have enough intrigue to hold on. I have a horrible attention span for movies, usually finishing them in several sittings or not at all, but this one was definitely a sitdown watch it all the way through movie.Obviously, it is about rape and revenge. It's incredibly graphic in the rape, and just as heartless. Then it's those long stretches of setup, but the payoff is great as we see her inflict double the terror upon her assailants."
4213,1,for my husband,"My husband was very interested in rewatching the original version again after the recent remake was released. He loved it, and now has both films in his growing moving collection."
4214,1,Not dissapointed,"I read reviews and asked a couple of people about this movie. I was very impressed. I have already watched it twice and i'll watch it again. Every woman should watch this movie. It was a very real situation that is never dealt with in that way.A woman leaves the city for some quiet time to write a book and runs into some problems. 4 Guys decide they want to rape her and they continuously do so. But they don't do it back to back. They toy with her. They beat her. They leave her for dead. Only, she isn't.She takes matters into her own hands and exacts her revenge on these guys. Every revenge scene was great. One particular bathroom scene, especially.This isn't really for the weak hearted. But it is a good movie (to me). My suggestion, watch it."
4216,1,Organic and tastes great!,I love this product. I am very excited to keep ordering this product. All the seeds grew. I will order again from this person.
4224,1,"It's a re-release, so what?","Yes, this is a past collection with a new title, but that doesn't mean it's a bad book. All three stories are terrific, but different enough to keep the reader from getting bored. I like the new title - it makes it easier to distinguish it from the other Long, Tall, Texans anthologies."
4228,1,Straightened hair the easy way,"I have wavy / curly hair and had all but given up on ever wearing it straight besides when my stylist blows it out after my haircut. Well, after receiving this styling tool, I have had great luck! It is super easy to use, if you can brush your hair, you can use this styling tool. Great, easy results quickly. Definitely love it."
4230,1,Best hair appliance ever!,I have fine frizzy wavy hair. Flattening irons tend to leave my hair without any body. The Infiniti BC173 smooths my hair and still gives it some lift. It's very easy to use which I like since I don't enjoy spending a lot of time styling my hair. I've even used it when I've let my hair almost completely dry naturally and it has already started to be curly and frizzy and this dryer smooths it out. Amazing!!! I've been using it for about 3 years now and it still keeps working like new. I've been thinking about buying another one in case Conair quits making them. I'm sure the one I have won't last forever. I hate it when I find something that works this well and then the company stops making it. Hopefully that won't happen. I don't usually bother to write reviews but this product really deserves a good one.
4243,1,We love cooperative games!,"Once you get over how cheap-looking the game is (so you may not want to buy it for a gift, if that would bother you), you'll realize how refreshing it is to play a cooperative game! My daughters loved working together to save the princess! Another friend likes playing it every time she comes over and has requested it for her birthday, so we're buying another.We also really like the ""Max"" game and ""The secret door"" from the same company. I think ""Max"" is the best game we've tried so far."
4244,1,Great,"It has so many parts. Colorful. Very nice for small and even older children. My grandchildren love the animals, also how they can set it up. Great for take along!"
4249,1,gret album from Mr.Excitement,Jackie Wilson was one of the baddest Musical artists ever. the Man was smooth and could Sing/Sang with the best of them. he was in the same class as Sam Cooke and James Brown back in the day. He truly had a unique style about him. this album is smooth and on time. the Motown band is on here and Jackie is leding the way. the Man could sing anything and make it sound so smooth. a Must have. the Brother is so underrated.
4261,1,Transformers the Movie,"If you were a kid during the 1980's and you loved Transformers like I did, this is a must own."
4268,1,Life sprang from nothing- right genius!,"One strand of DNA holds as much info a set of 26 book encyclopedias. And not random info either. Change one sentence and the whole thing falls apart. Yet idiotic evolutionists believe DNA magically came into existance by random chance and then went through billions of positive mutations to advance to all the different stages and types of life today.One genetetist said that's about as likely as a tornado going through a junk yard and producing a fully assembled and functioning 747 aircraft.Sorry, I don't have enough faith to believe in evolution; I'm only a Christian."
4269,1,I love it!,My wife bought me this drill in 2002 for Christmas and I don't think I will ever need another one. It's the perfect size and weight for almost any job and has more than enough power to keep up with tough repetitive tasks without overheating.
4273,1,Fantabulous! Super duper!,"Oh the JOY of reading Doctor Dolittle books! This is a great one. How can it be no publisher(s) have reprinted all the books including the zoo, the moon, the garden, the post office, puddleby adventures etc.?? Are they mad? These books are timeless stories that appeal to animal lovers everywhere!"
4275,1,Petzold as always,"Whenever you hear the name Petzold, the only thing to examine is if the subject is for you. This is for beginner programmers who want to start in C# and not ONLY for beginners in C# but otherwise experienced in other environments. All negative reviwers here state that simple fact!So if you are a beginner in programming who wants to start in C# this is the absolutely FIRST book you must own. PERIOD.Also, dont think that the material is outdated, since it covers the basics."
4280,1,Kept me at the edge of my seat!,"I have to say that the plot to this movie is original. It makes you realize that one decision you make can change your life completely. I really liked the pace of it, and I felt involved watching it. Because of the nature of the plot, you cannot really predict what will happen next. Five stars!"
4293,1,Silver's Best Efforts Yet!,"I am always amazed with Silver's work, but this book absolutely blew me away. Silver has a rare talent of taking some extremely tough subjects and putting them in a way that anyone can understand. Although this particular book has a leaning toward teaching the teen witch, it is also an indepth study for us crones :-) After all of her books over the past 12 years or so, I can't imagine what she could possibly write next - but believe me, I'll be first in line for her next book!"
4296,1,perfect,"This book was listed in good condition but not 1 single flaw on or in it. Amazing book in amazing shape. Thank you. Oh, and it arrived ahead of schedule."
4301,1,it rocked harder than manson himself,i liked this video because it showed his better songs.it rocks and if you don't believe me watch it for yourself.
4306,1,great story,"I usually don't like heroes to be princes and royalties from some unknown kingdoms but Rolfe was a great one. I liked his story and his behaviour (or at least I could understand why he behaved the way he did). The same goes for Angeline - she was a strong woman who was able to stand for herself and still stay gentle and caring. The story was full of action and though Jennifer Blake used quite flowery language, I really enjoyed reading it. Very well-written and believable with a lot of interesting side characters (the royal guard). I definitely recommend this book, and also Surrender in Moonlight from Jennifer Blake. (but beware, the love scenes are pretty steamy :-)"
4308,1,Great intro to the genre.,"I bought this book way back in 1986. I was 18 yrs. old and had just gotten over a case of the flu that was so bad I thought I was literally going to die. When I was finally well enough to leave the house, I bought this book at the supermarket to celebrate my coming back to life, so to speak. It was my very first hardcore (read: steamy and sexy) romance. Unlike so many others, it had an interesting plot and characters. RS was the perfect blend of good storytelling and steamy love scenes; it's an excellent introduction to the word of romance novels."
4315,1,Life Could Not Better Be,"I have to say that the Court Jester is my favorite movie. It will keep you entertained, and it is full of laughs. I don't need to say anymore, except that you will love it, and cherish it."
4318,1,Fun for the whole family!,This was a family favorite for me growing up and we still quote several lines from this movie. I recently introduced this movie to my young children and they liked it as well. Danny Kaye is amazing!
4322,1,Comedy Could Not Better Be!,"Danny Kaye stars in this uproarious, hilarious, witty, timeless comedy about a Jester embroiled in affairs of state, romance, and laughter in a medieval kingdom.This is a film to watch over and over again!""Life could not better be, better be, better be..."""
4323,1,Classic comedy,"One of the best films Danny Kaye appeared in, and backed by an equally fantastic cast in top form: basil rathbone, angela lansbury, etc. Great comedy, great musical numbers, and a healthy dose of action. This movie is seriously funny."
4326,1,This movie is real life...,"First of all, i like to state that Larry clark's ""kids"" is more like vision of how real kids act who barely enter 10th grade act nowdays and when i seen it? I was suprised that it was made few years ago because it seems like it was made just today because thats how kids realy act...Specialy the white boys who act black its so true and so real i relay ddi like it for that part.. Watch it! It's f*cking sick..."
4332,1,everyone needs to listen up!,"the first time i saw this movie, it really gave me a reality check as to who i was as a person. it appears as though the people who are always putting this movie down are people who either grew up in a very secluded neighborhood, or people who think that their kids could never get involved in an atmosphere such as the one seen in ""KIDS"". What people do behind their parents backs, is most of the time expected to be undiscovered and Mr. Clark has given today's society a very long-overdue wake up call to the parents out there, so that they are more involved."
4334,1,It May Not Be Your Reality But It Is Mine,"It kills me when people say that Kids is an unrealistic discription of teen life. For one thing, the people who say that are 40+ and are hoping this is not what their kids are doing. Second, these kids were not living in the cornfields of Ohio, they were in the ghetto. They were not acting psycho, they were just being kids, reckless, searching kids. Just like me. I never once doubted the reality of this movie. I was just wondering why someone took so long to bust the Breakfast Club bubble of the 80s and tell the truth about the 90s teen. We do stupid things and think we have every right to do it. Why should anyone have control of our lives, it not rebellion, its God given freedom. This is how the teenage mind works. Those miniture ""psychos"" are going to grow up and inherit the world. BE PREPARED!!!! If your kid doesn't know people who act like the characters in Kids, they ARE the person who acts like that."
4335,1,Realistic niew of adolescence,"Ever wonder what your kids are doing when they say they're staying at a friend's place over the weekend? Ever think to yourself ""Im sure i had another $10 in there""....This movie is not only entertaining, but educational to both parents and adolescents. My only quam is that in some cases it glorifies the life these kids are living. No doubt in their own mind they are living in glory, however, the stark reality is quite the opposite, and i think this message gets blurred at times."
4336,1,It is an excellent book.,"This book is a well-written critique on character education. It realistically categorizes the popular sects of moral philosophy and gives each one a fair yet tough analysis of it's strengths and weaknesses. The writing itself is very good, and makes a relatively dry topic entertaining. If you are interested in understanding the trends of contemporary moral education, I would suggest buying this."
4339,1,Eye-Opener,"Bearing through the storm of unexpected ailment and deterioration in a loved one is never a sought-out experience. Kathy Boswell guides and prepares the reader for such a journey in YOUR MOTHER HAS SUFFERED A SLIGHT STROKE with clarity and honesty. Tackling the throes of hushed medical propoganda, retirement home adjustments, and neurological damage, she leads and enlightens through persistence born by love. We would be wise to share in her journey for our own family emergencies with are certain to arise."
4343,1,how chick flicks should be!,Jane Austen gets it right again with the heroine being worthy of the great guy. Fun story with good characters.
4353,1,DVD movie,"This was a gift for my granddaughter. The movie arrived inpristine shape and very quickly. She loved the movie. Funny,her daddy did too at the same age. Some movies are ""timeless.""This is one of them.Would recommend the seller."
4355,1,"A ""MUST READ"" for all Home Inspectors!",This book is the premiere reference book for new Home Inspectors. The authors' knowledge is based on thousands of inspections. The layout and style of the book make it very easy to read and reference. There is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost. MUST READ
4357,1,Great game!!!!,Our kids grew up with this game and always loved it. We plan on keeping it for our next generation. Now I am getting it for another family to be able to enjoy in the same way.
4367,1,my son's favorite and MORE,This was my son's favorite book for many years. He now reads it to our grandchildren - his neices! We run a full-blown preschool with an average of 110 children each year and I read it to each class every year and they all LOVE it. I lost our copy at the preschool and NEED another one so I'm buying a second one. WE LOVE THIS BOOK!
4370,1,Best book ever!,I read this book in 1st grade and I still like it now! As soon as I read this book my favorite animal became a cat. I liked how Erin Hunter told the story from Rusty\Firepaw`s view.
4371,1,love it!!!!!,could not stop reading until i had read them all i loved this book because it gave me a resonable idea of what my catcould be thinking my cat is dead now but i have 2 newborn kittens who love the out doors i just hope they do not go join a clan!!!!!
4372,1,For Readers of all Ages.,"I started reading the Warriors series when I was about 11, and I was immediatly captivated. First off, I was searching desperatly for an animal-fantasy book, so this series was like a miracle. I started to read the book, and I couldn't stop. Each character is so interesting, and the chemistry between each was wonderful. I read the whole series as fast as I could. It's been two years, and I am still a faithful Warriors fan. The stories themselves have interesting plots that twist and turn in every direction. These are still some of my favorite books, even though I'm 13. These stories are a good pleaser for all ages."
4379,1,i love this book,this is an amazing book with great action and is a pageturner with a great plot and lots of supense.
4384,1,Into The Wild...,"This book will capture your imagination; you will look at the old house cat in a whole new way! It is for more than just children, although they love it too! Hunter dose a splendid job in creating a fantastic world of culture and legend for our feline friends. I highly recommend this series, for all ages. You will find it captures train of thoughts and keeps you thinking of the characters and what you think may happen even when the book is closed. Splendid, no animal and fantasy lover's collection is complete with-out these! A Must Read!"
4404,1,great book,"this book is great for ages 10+. keeps your mind on the book and doesn't get boring. by the end, the reader is left astound. it is about a young half vampires journey to the vampire kingdom, vampire mountain, where he is welcomed warmly by other and gets to see many of his kind.There is one problem though; he was blooded (when blood travels from the vampire to the soon to be vampire) too early. Therefore, to prove himself worthy of being part of the vampire clan, he must engage the trials of initiation."
4410,1,The power of observation,"Alan Hollinghurst has been a fine novelist for many years, starting with ""The Swimming Pool Library,"" but in ""The Line of Beauty"" his powers of observation and insight are at their height whether writing about the mundane or the consequential.Is in not a matter of what this book is ""about,"" it is a work of art and an experience that you don't want to end."
4418,1,"High quality, helpful for leveling and front wheel stability","Lightweight but high quality, stable unit. I bought this go go with my CycleOps wind trainer. Glad I did because otherwise I'd be riding downhill the whole way. Yes, this is a ""leveler"" and you would need to stack another to go ""uphill."" Keep in mind that if you raise the entire bike up, it may be harder to get onto the bike if the top beam of your frame is already high for you. Can't imagine what could be better. Recommended.Update: I still think think this is a great item and worth buying with the trainer, but more for stability than leveling. The trainer only raises the back wheel a little bit so the downhill sensation I was worried about isn't so much of an issue. The bigger problem is that without this item your front wheel may be wobbly."
4420,1,Bike block,You MUST purchase this if you plan on getting a bike trainer. It is great and really makes the bike stable. I was surprised by the size of it - it looks like it would be small but is in fact fairly large. Great product!
4421,1,CycleOps stackable climbing block,The block will level out the front wheel of your bike while on your trainer or will give you the feel of an uphill climb. Great buy as a trainer accessory.
4428,1,MEST woohoo,"Destination Unknown was an instant hit with me I loved it! After listening to it for the first time I was wanting to roll in a cadillac down the small town streets of Iowa where I live....Ok so maybe Iowa isn't the best place to roll in a cadillac but that doesn't matter! what matters is that this CD is just the coolest thing. the instant it was in my CD player the volume was cranked up to be sure and vibrate the floor. The CD was fun but also had a lot of truth to it as in the songs Another Day, Fucted up Kid and Mothers Prayer just to name a few, but its hard to name specific songs that should be listened to because the whole CD just flat out rules and I highly recommend it!..."
4441,1,Profound and Informative,"As a Roman Catholic graduate student in philosophy of religion/theology, I rarely find books on spirituality/religion that are written for non-academic audiences to be much good. This book, however, is a notable exception. Its exposition of Eastern Orthodox spirituality (especially hesychasm and the Jesus Prayer) is moving and clearly written. Usually, Western Christendom has spoken condemningly (if at all) of hesychasm. This book opens up the deep, Christocentric, ancient practices of Eastern Orthodox monasticism for anyone to see and understand. I found much in this book to challenge me and surprise me. I cannot recommend it strongly enough for anyone who is interested in taking a good, long look at practices of prayer and Easter Orthodoxy. A must-read for Christians."
4445,1,the minor proves the major,"Is Ulysses the greatest novel of the century?Yes, surpassing all other literary endeavors in scope, depth, and intelligence.Is it unintelligible?No, nor is it undecidable, but only pointedly, significantly ambiguous.Why this quality?So that the reader must work as hard (if not harder)than the author himself did when composing the novel. And it is a composition.Why should the reader work?So that he/she might learn something substantial; so that he/she will be able to view the world with a new mind's eye.Does it suffice to read the book only once and quickly?Nope.Diagnosis for anyone who assigns the book less than five stars:idler; incapable of intense intellectual effort; probably likes vonnegut."
4451,1,Nothing could compare,"Ulysses is the greatest thing (in all of arts and sciences)ever created by a man. I have read it all the way through once, and have re-read the individual episodes plenty of times on their own. A whole part of my life was defined by the reading of this book. It is no small undertaking to construct a universe. Ulysses is more than a machine, more than an organism; Ulysses is a universe. If you want to read deeper into things (which of course you do, if you're reading this book), then the most indispensible of the commentaries is Stuart Gilbert's, which was written under Joyce's supervision."
4452,1,Not For Everyone,"This is a fascinating book for those who have the patience and time to explore its intricate chapters and themes. Yet, it should not be forced upon anyone as required reading or for that matter anyone under the age of 21. The richess and complexity of the Circe episode alone earns a 5 star rating. Other episodes such as Cyclops, Ithica, Nausicaa and (of course) Penelope are memorable. There were times (Oxen of the Sun, Scylla and Charrybdis) that I just did not have the energy required to continue, but on the whole, a worthy venture.It particularly helps if you can identify with the eroding dreams of either Leopold Bloom or Stephen Deedalus. That is why it may appeal to those who their 20's just making their way out in life or those who middle aged such as myself, who reflect upon what has gone down and what is yet to come."
4453,1,"""Ulysses"" by James Joyce - Gabler Edition",BOOK WAS IN LIKE-NEW CONDITION AND WAS PRICED AT $8.50 RATHER THAN $19.95 AT BOOK STORES.
4460,1,"Extremely interesting book, combines history and information","Sisters: Catholic Nuns and the Making of America is anoverview of the influence and contributions of nuns in thevast American land. There are a few statistics, someinterviews, and a great deal of history. History can bea very slow read. It can be to dense to wade through.But Fialka does a great job of presenting history in away that is not only interesting, but also enjoyable toread. The only sad part, of course, comes in the latterpart of the book when he writes of the decline of somany of the sisterhoods. Some of the decline was fast andintense, some has been slower - but all of it seems tobe painful. There are a few glimmers of hope, though.Some of the work done by the Dominican Sisters of Nashvilleand the Oblate Sisters of Providence is wonderful."
4462,1,miles of memories,This albumn is another collection of great songs from Dierks! It flows well from beginning to end. I can really feel the heart and soul he put into each song.
4466,1,Love this book!,This has been a favorite of mine for years. It is a great story about liberty and the consequences of trying to take away liberties to make society better. Highly recommended.
4467,1,Only Thing That Works For Me,"I had dry eye problems that caused filamentary keratitis (little tunnels from the surface of my eye inwards), after having them removed (painfully) several times I went to a different doctor that suggested I try Theratears Omega-3. They are a bit pricey (check your local Walgreens and keep the coupon for a $1 off that comes inside the box) but they are the only thing that have worked for me.I tried switching a few times to other brands that costs less and I immediately noticed a difference. The Omega-3's also seem to help with mood and joint pain. If you have stomach problems taking them at first just start with one pill at night and after a week go to two, and after another week 3. You can also split up the doses though I don't recommend 3 a day at first unless you are already on Omega-3s.I felt such a difference after a few weeks of taking these that I found a reputable supplier of childrens chewable Omega-3s for my son!"
4469,1,Greatest product for dry eyes!,"I have suffered from dry eyes for the past two years and i have tried numerous products. I have tried supplements, eye drops, compresses,etc. The thera tears have been highly recommended by my eye doctor. My meibomian glands are not releasing the oily film effectively so it leaves my aqueous tears unprotected and so my eye dries up faster.Ever since I started taking thera tears I was able to feel and see a difference within 5-7 days. I don't wake up with my eyes dry shut anymore and my eyes aren't blurry anymore.Pros:1.Can tell a difference and my eyes aren't as dry as they were before2.It contains fish oil which is also great for your heart and vasculature3. Price is great and cheaper than store prices4.They don't SMELL like fish pills5.It's dosed once a day versus other products that are 2-3 times a dayCons: only 11.They tend to cause you to belch some fishy smell.I highly recommend this product!!"
4470,1,EXCELLENT BOOK!!!!,"I was given this book as a gift from a friend who said, ""Now you'll understand what's going on with your life, Diane. You're a mustang. That's not a negative."" When I read Fawn Germer's Mustang Sallies, I knew what she meant. I've always felt misunderstood and underappreciated. Now I realize I am what Germer calls a ""trailblazer."" I've never been one to go along to get along, and I don't kiss up to move up. That's hurt me in the past, but Mustang Sallies is filled with strategies to make me succeed without selling out. I love this book. (...) It's phenomenal."
4472,1,Provides great advise,"Had this book a longtime on my wishlist. Finaly got it.I like the way it's written. It's very clear, and well structured. Full of advises and tips. I especially liked chapters 5 and 6, on ""Setting your fees"" and ""Finding your Markets"". But the appendices are really amazing! List of fees (!), Sample contracts (!), Sample promos, model documents,.... you can just use!!!! I mean if you ever wanted to make a jump-start with writing,... this will certainly help."
4474,1,Tailored to perfection,The Tailor of Panama is an excellent and entertaining film. Both actors Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush bring a great sense of enjoyment to their characters. Mr. Brosnan brings a great sense of wickedness to his character Andy Osnard. Mr. Rush brings a great sense of naivetivity and at deception to his character Harry Pendel.When Harry begins to spin his lies to Osnard both men know what's going on.But they allow each other to keep going just to see were everything leads to. I really liked the ending of the film. I also enjoyed the way it was filmed the scenery of Panama is breathtaking and the music adds a sense of mystery and excotic feelings. Also the story is very interesing. Although at times the movie kinda drags along it is overall very enjoyable.I really liked this film and I think it's a very enjoyable movie.

4486,1,Interviews with Americans tell the truth about Individualism,"This book is about the inevitable conflict between American Individualism and the fact that humans are by nature social. We hunger for relationship yet we want it only on our terms. Bellah and his team of reseachers take on the enormous task of interviewing people from all over the country and the results of these interviews are presented factually and then analyzed. Whether one agrees with the book's conclusions or not, the interviewees speak for themselves, and they speak for a majority of Americans today who are often torn by conflicting authoritative messages and motives from without and within. This book is a marvelous and sometimes unsettling mirror into contemporary American society."

4492,1,"Clean, Scentless, Wife is not allergic",My wife is highly allergic and it has been quite difficult to find something that is ok for us to use. This is the only product that isn't sticky and fits that profile. Worth the higher price...
4506,1,THE BEST VISUAL INTERPRETATION OF ROMEO AND JULIET,"SHAKESPEARE, WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD THAT THIS MASTERPIECE WAS VISUALLY SCULPTED WITH THE AUTHENTIC DIGNITY AND PURE INNOCENCE AND BEAUTY, THAT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT COULD NOT COMPETE WITH SHAKESPEARE'S GENIUS VERBALITY."
4510,1,Romeo & Juliet DVD,I have loved this movie since I first viewed it in the theater in the 60's. It's my favorite version and the actual DVD is perfect in every way.
4515,1,Great For An Overcast Day,"Hysterical movie. If you are down, pop this in the DVD and lift your spirits. Great fun, just like the original!"
4516,1,Brother Ray Charles,ive been a Ray charles fan for many years and this cd is excellentits all about tears but tears is a part of live happy tears and sad tearsany ray charles fans should add this to there collection i give it 5 stars
4518,1,Great product,This is a great briefcase that looks very well made. We have tried many different types of briefcases throughout the years but hope this one last until retirement.... his first case was a Samsonite and hopefully his last one before retirement!
4525,1,THIS IS THE BEST MADONNA VIDEO!!1,THE STORY IS WELL-WRITTEN. ABBY(MADONNA) IS A YOGA TEACHER AND ROBERT(RUPERT EVERETT)IS A LANDSCAPER AND IS GAY. ONE NIGHT THEY HAVE A WILD ROMP AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW ABBY IS CARRYING A BABY. THEN IT GETS CONFUSING. ROBERT AND ABBY DO NOT GET MARRIED BUT LIVE TOGETHER AND RAISE THE CHID AS TOGETHER.

4534,1,"To europeans customers, that its allsome!!","I dont know if every FUNIMATION Bluray have A/B Region but that is the coolest thing that FUNIMATION have ever make, because in Spain we dont have this anime series relesed on dvd or Bluray (we have dubbed for TV, but not more).Thanks for everything!"
4551,1,Yes!,"It's even better this time around. Less gore, more fun. Of course it's campy--it's supposed to be. But aside from the not-quite-there later version of the Scorpion King, this movie's a romp from start to finish. Most of the main folk are back and there's ""you know...mummies...pygmies...big...bugs."" Give me this over any of those stupid dumb-joke popular flicks any day. Amusing, worthwhile characters and plenty of action. And thanks, Mr. Sommers, for bringing Ardeth Bey back. He's got too much talent to waste."
4554,1,Finally a tea kettle that works!!!,I love my new tea kettle. I have had several and been dis-satisfied with the way the whistle is much too weak. I need one that sounds the ALARM! This one is terrific. I highly recommend it!
4561,1,"Simple Plot, What's The Problem?","I've heard from so many people that the main problem with ""Mission Impossible"" is its plot, that it's ""impossible"" to inderstand, when in fact it is very easy to understand. In short, Tom Cruise is trying to clear his name by finding the real traitor of the team. Redgrave knows who that person is and promises to tell Cruise, but in return, he must get her the noc file, that's what that whole ""acrobat"" seen is about. They plan to meet on the train, and the rest is history. Okay now?"
4563,1,High-tech High-spy High-good,"This is a high-tech spy movie that is very good. Cruise puts in one of his best performances and the other actors perform excellently. There is enough variety to keep some suspense going. There is certainly enough action, without having to resort to blow up everything in sight (like some other ""summer"" blockbusters). The transfer to DVD is excellent and the other sound and editing are very good."
4565,1,How not to be fooled by the politicians,"Great book written for non-economics students to understand the long term effects of popular issues. The chapter on housing costs simply but brilliantly explains the folly of rent control, zoning control, hi-rise prevention, etc. and how they hurt the common person.Great read if you don't want to remain in the fog of the political vote buyers."
4570,1,"SOS: A Girl's Guide Sex, Optimism, Surviving 21st Century","Clever, funny, witty and full of contemporary wisdom, this book is a must for women of all ages. From how to change a tyre to how to change a man, this is the ultimate how-to for modern living. Give it to your best friend as well as your grandmother. An enjoyable read."
4571,1,Much better than the modem from the DSL provider!,I had a Westell modem which liked to simply disconnect from the internet whenever it felt like it. The download transfer rate averaged around 40k and I was told this was as fast as I could possibly obtain due to my address being along the fringes of the DSL coverage area.After getting fed up with the Westell I purchased this modem and my download transfer rate now averages in the 300k range and jumps over 1MB quite often. I know a lot has to do with server location but nothing else changed but the modem. My browsing habits have been the usual for the past week.Installation was very easy. Very. It performs exactly as I expected and the price wasn't bad either.
4587,1,Shelly Laurenston books,"ABSOLUTELY LOVED (HERE KITTY, KITTY, PACK CHALLENGE AND GO FETCH) THIS TRIO AND ALL THE REST OF HER SHIFTER SERIES BOOKS. THE AUTHOR HAS AN AWESOME SENSE OF HUMOR THAT CONSTANTLY IS MAKING ME LAUGH, PLUS THE CHARACTERS ARE SO LOVEABLE. THEY ROCK CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE JUST LIKE THEM."
4588,1,Inspector Morse is a very special detective,Typically wonderful Colin Dexter story. Complex plot line with a minimal number of red herrings. Well worth the read and investment of time.
4591,1,Woah,"i could hardly believe how excellent this film was when I saw it. I already knew the story that it's based on, and although some things were slightly changed, its for the better.Old Al does a fine job here, hes not the typical yelling loud character he usually is and carries the role perfectly. Russel Crowe's face is also 100% neccisary in the movie.Michael Mann's direction is also pure genious. Every scene is done perfectly.You won't be dissapointed."
4594,1,An excellent movie!,"The Insider is a powerful look into the tobacco indestry, and how they lied about the nicitene. Both Russell Crowe and Al Pacino are fantastic in the film. This movie is for anyone who enjoys a deep look into a very contraversal subject."
4595,1,Russell Crowe steals this show!,Can you imagine a scientist standing up against the tobacco industry? Can you imagine this scientist recorded a segment on 60 minutes and that 60 minutes refused to air the program because of political pressure? This really happened. Russell Crowe is fascinating in this study of a man caught between morality and saving him self and his family from psychological torture. Al Pacino plays the producer who ultimately gets the scientists testimony heard after going to the New York Times with the story. This is a story that every one can relate to. It is gripping. Crowe should have won an academy award for his performance.
4600,1,BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO HOLLYWOOD,"Only Wenders could have done it: shoot a film in Hollywood that is 100% non-Hollywood. And that is the best part of it! Even Mel Gibson plays a different role, perhaps one of his best - not a super hero, but someone with a human face, a human story. The music is fantastic, the story is well told. Hate to discuss the events, in case you still have not seen the film. If you are looking for something different than the usual senseless blockbuster evening entertainment with pop corn - see this movie, and you will never forget it..."
4612,1,"Tripnotic Trance...Blue Foundation ""Sweep of Days"" my FAV so far!","Blue Foundation is a new band for me, I discovered them from Twilight movie soundtrack..their first song I heard ""Eyes on Fire"" captured my attention right away! I then started listening to other songs, downloading 99 cent songs here and there through Amazon..but this album..I bought in entirety! All the songs are GOOD...I love their style."
4615,1,Love this kind of movies!,I have just seen this movie and I think it's wonderful. From beginning to end it's sweet and touching. It's the perfect movie for everyone who likes intelligent comedy with a lot of heart. All three main Actors are great. EDWARD NORTON forever!
4622,1,Really good,"Wow...I have to tell you that as much as this was compared to other recent cocaine movies, like Traffic, this movie reminds me of nothing less than Goodfellas. The characters are very much brothers from different mothers. Very good comparison. And to anyone who has entertained notions about Penelope Cruz' sexiness, you may be in for a rude surprise.Having said that, since Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz are dating, well, doesn't it take a special kind of ego for someone to date someone else because their last names are pronounced the same?"
4641,1,An Undesputed Classic,"I read the Stranger (actually i read the translation entitled The Outsider, but it's the same thing) in my grade 11 world literature class. The book revolves around the main character named Meursault. The novel, deep rooted in its existentialist theme, is one of the most mentally stimulating books you will ever read. Albert Camus suggests that the pinnacle of hypocrisy in society is its quickness to judge people upon appearances or behavior, versus its apparent incapacity to judge people upon fact. I will refrain from making any conjectures about the novel, its theme and message, because that is something you must do for yourself. After reading the novel, dont rush to the internet to read essays and reviews about the novel. Instead spend some time contemplating the book yourself. Then open yourself to the opinions of others. It is one of those books that you will never forget, and will change the way you see things, at least temporarly."
4642,1,Subtle and engaging,"This book certainly rings as true today as it did when it first came out, as our society produces more and more non-heroes like this, dulled to most everything. An important work of modern literature."
4649,1,An amazing piece of literature,"Camus is brilliant. I've read this book 4 times, and only after taking a course in existentialism have I realized it's full importance."
4653,1,In response to Scott Eliason,"Hi, Scott! Listen, the latest edition always has an earlier date but in this case, as in previous printings, at the beginning there is an addenda including 18,000 new words or new meanings to words already included. This may seem unsuitable, but just think that by leafing through the addenda you get to learn about the new language of the last 10 years!"
4667,1,pocket protector for my lab jecket,"I use this item to hold multiple scissors, needle drivers and reflex hammer in the pocket of my white clinical lab jacket--works great! No more holes torn out in the pocket and all items transfer out of my coat into book bag or locker quickly and easily. Highly recommend, very sturdy build quality!"
4670,1,Five star!!!!! Sam's Letters to Jennifer,"I had been meaning to read this book, Sam's Letters to Jennifer, for some time now. I stayed up most of the night because I just couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what came next, again and again. The story held my attention right to the very last page. Wonderful, endearing, and classis James Patterson!"
4671,1,Magnificent Read!!!,Such a sweet story! I loved this book and totally recommend it!Everyone should read this. Young or old! =)
4676,1,I Wonder Why,"This could be the best CD although it's missing ""Book Of Love"" by The Monotones but on top of that, it's a really good multi-disc album a few remakes and original recordings."
4680,1,Tom savini did a great gob I love it,George a Romero my favorite director of all time made the og version and he trusted savini to direct the remake it and it was awesome.savini did a great job with this film he put his own twist on it I loved it if you have not seen it see it buy it now you will not be disappointed if you liked the og you will want to watch this one great zombie movie savini is awesome
4681,1,GREAT IDEA!,This a better film than 68 version in every way! Best of all color! I was starting to think it might never hit DVD. Thank god
4691,1,A real Gem ...must own movie !,"This is one of my all time favorite movies & should be in everyone's collection. The main reason for my review though is I found an older brief mention of this info on another website ...but, a PAL format ""Amorphoric Widescreen"" Doc Hollywood was released in March 2006. I ordered it from Amazon.com.uk for the total price of $10.00 (3.99 + shipping) & received my order here in the U.S. approx. 9 days later.Here is a direct link:[...]It's kinda strange [...] doesn't list the aspect ratio (it's 1:85:1) or that's it's widescreen ...however, even though it's in PAL format ...this is your only choice for now if you that want to own this awsome movie in Amorphoric Widescreen !"
4699,1,Pinocchio Review,Just as wonderful to watch now as it was when I was a little girl. Now my little girl gets to enjoy it! She loves it and has watched it many times. Beautifully done.
4703,1,Adorable Wooden Boy,Walt Disney masterpiece at its best!!! This keeps you young at heart!!! Everyone should get a Walt Disney moivie collection from Amazon.
4715,1,womens accessories,I love this hat for skiing. The lining kept me nice and warm in blizzard conditions. I wore it every day of my week long ski trip.
4716,1,One of my favorite,This is not your typical Stephen King nightmare flicks. It is more thought provoking and Christopher Walken does an outstanding job of a man revived from a prolonged coma with a special ability. Even if you don't like Stephen King movies you will like this one.
4723,1,"Really, REALLY good book about boys.","Not only did I learn about some of the things that my son will go through as he grows up, I learned a lot about his dad and other boys in my life. I think this had to be one of the most informative books about boys and young men I have ever read."
4724,1,Raising Cain a must read for all who are raising or educating boys.,"This book is fantastic and written by 2 men who really know what they are talking about. It is written with clarity and in depth knowledge about boys regarding every aspect of their life. This is something that we all need to be aware of when raising boys and dealing with boys. Emotional illiteracy is widespread in our culture because of the way we socialise boys, as we don't allow them to get in touch with their feelings. This disconnection from the inner world causes much pain to him, and people who are close to him, as they often are unable to connect deeply with others, or to be truly empathetic. I applaud the men who wrote this book and I am at present working with a male client who is getting a great deal from the concepts discussed therein. It is a must read."
4730,1,A fun movie with a great cast and tight screenplay.,"Tremors tells the classic story of a small community fighting for survival against underground monsters. It's classic horror-movie stuff with a twist: unlike most Hollywood horror flicks, the characters look and talk like real people, and as the story progresses, you actually root for them to win. The last horror flick I saw where I didn't cheer for the monsters was the original 'Night of the Living Dead' (1969). The cast makes the people of Perfection real to us, and the dialogue is as sharp and funny as the best Mel Brooks movie. The action is fast-paced, but the tone is always positive. This film is great fun; I never get tired of watching it. Be sure to check out the ""Making of..."" feature and the original ending; excellent documentaries from the film-makers. You'll enjoy this disk for years to come."
4734,1,I absolutely love the movie!,"Love the special effects, the characters and the plot. Val & Earl may be country handymen, but they are heroic - very responsible. Rhonda the seismologist student is smart and a survival. Burt & wife are a matching pair. Great potrayal of Val & Rhonda subtle attractions. And the creatures, they learn fast. Each can only be destroyed in a different way, first by accident upon hitting RC drain head on, second by elephant gun, third by ""bomb fishing technique"" and last by tricking it into jumping off the cliff. Absolutely great movie!"
4737,1,"Learning from revelation, God is good--not terrifying.","Systematic theology or memoir? Yes. The organization and intent is theological leading us from our existence in God, our humanity, our desire for the good, crucifixion, resurrection, and beyond. The method is to use her own life to lead us through the topics. Bondi suffered from traumatic childhood experiences including bad revival preaching. She was maimed by an image of a wrathful God that demands our sacrifice. Through study, prayer, and revelation, she learns that God, as God and as a human being, came among us to bring us healing....Read Chapter 4 before going to hear any Good Friday or Easter sermons."
4744,1,"I can't caution you enough, buy only new, unused uranium ore","The used stuff has a nasty aroma, and sometimes isn't all that hygienic. Well, it really depends on what you want to use it for I suppose..."
4745,1,A godsend!,"I have been looking for this for years! Finally, the perfect thing to put in the trunk of my '64 Chevy Malibu!"
4747,1,Fun for the whole family + excellent upgrade for your spudgun,"Not only do all 4 of us college students living here love this stuff (it goes great on pizza, and keeps it piping hot for hours!), our cats have taken a liking to using it as a face-scratcher, and it's done wonders for their coats. Far less dander now, and their glow-in-the-dark tags are even visible during the day!As an added bonus, once you've depleted the entire jar, you can upgrade your spudgun to use depleted uranium rounds! Using high-pressure steel parts instead of PVC is highly recommended if you do this, but the increased range and damage is worth it."
4749,1,Great For Tomatoes!!!,"In preperation for the upcoming zombie apocalypse I bought this Uranium to give a little extra ""umph"" to the Miracle Grow that I usually spray on my garden. Being able to garden in the middle of the night was an unexpected benefit of this miracle product. The vegetables started to glow beautifully which made them easier to pick, however some of the little buggers do try to bite me while I'm working. I told my neighbor that he was welcome to anything in my garden not realizing how territorial the tomatoes had become. They didn't recognize him and he lost an arm. Fortunately he gained a tentacle in its place so it's all good."
4755,1,T'ai Chi Forms Grand Champion & Team USA Martial Arts Coach,"The T'ai Chi Forms Grand Champion (Sifu Hong Yijiao) & Team USA Martial Arts Coach (Michael Steward, Sr.) captured the essence of this book. In their excellant ratings below.It paints a vision and explains T'ai Chi & Qigong using Western science and cultural concepts. As a San Francisco teacher wrote, ""it brings Qigong to the people, as Apple did with the computer.""The medical research and modern terminology are effective reference tools for T'ai Chi & Qigong teachers as well as their students."
4766,1,Great book!,"I read this book when I was 14 and I loved it, I still do! this is well worth reading. It is an exciting tale of adventure and revenge and one man's story! I loved it! read it!"
4769,1,A truly remarkable work!,"This is one of the best books ever written. The characterizations are remarkable. Certainly a ""must-have"" for anyone who likes to read. It is a long book, but the richness of the text will more than compensate you for the time spent reading.The characters all comport themselves with a dignity and nobility that cannot be seen or portrayed by people of our time period. It is as though all of the characters have the distinction of Anthony Hopkins(and this still does not do it justice!). This work is a feast for the mind!"
4777,1,Easy to digest and fun,"Just finished this marvelous classic. Don't delay - start reading today, this new translation is fabulous. Now it's on to Madame Bovary!"
4782,1,Another Classic,"Was forced to read as a teenager and just read again in my 40's. Wonderfully written (maybe a little wordy), awesome characters, love story, adventure, intrigue, etc. What more could you ask of a book?"
4784,1,Christmas gift,My son is an avid reader and is interested in reading the classics. The look of the cover is very nice according to my son. He said he is looking forward to reading The Count of Monte Cristo! It's is the second classic I have purchased for him and will continue purchasing more of the classics to help him build up his library of classic books.
4789,1,excellent service,I received a beautiful book to give my daughter for her birthday. The condition was just as it was described and the service was excellent.
4790,1,Awesome!,Very entertaining adventure-fiction classic. Once you begin you can't put it down. Highly recommended.Now I have to read Aledandre Duma'sThe Three Musketeersas well.
4792,1,The BEST book I've ever read. I'll miss it.,"Monsieur Le Comte is incredible!!!! The best book I've ever read; I'll miss it... I could not tear myself away from this book... My two year-old recognizes it as ""papi's book"" because I could not put it down.... I kept my wife up with the story and got a chance to relive it that way. She loved it too.Dumas makes you fall in love with his characters, with Mercedes, Edmond Dantes, Abbe Faria, Valentine, Haydee, M.Morrel.... and he makes you hate the bad guys, Danglars, Villefort, Morcef... But in the end you end up doubting just like M. Le Comte.... Every character has an incredible story and every story will take you deap into the time and place and the feeling of it all....This book cannot be described. It must be read. If you will only read one good book in your life; make sure it's this one."
4797,1,Not just a great adventure novel...,"Alexandre Dumas was considered in his time to be the foremost adventure novelist. What he created in The Count of Monte Cristo is so much more. The story chronicles the journey of Edmund Dantes, a young and hopelessly naive sailor as he matures into the worldy and cynical Count bent on revenge. Had Dumas ended there, he would have written a stupendous and sweeping saga of adventure and drama. The greater relevence of the story is in its moral telling: Edmund Dantes regains his humanity and learns to live again. Here is a story of spiritual redemption, told against the backdrop of post-Napoleanistic France. It is a tale of love, of loss, of revenge, and of the rekindling of the heart. While the unabridged story is long, it is best enjoyed while seated in front of a fire, with a warm beverage in hand. Few narratives are as satisfying to the soul as this one is."
4802,1,Astounding book!,"When I first started this book, I thought, ""Oh, I'm never going to finish!"" That was very wrong. This masterpiece of a novel is next-to-impossible to put down. I became so involved in the book that, when I finished, I felt sort of deprived. I wished the book would continue for another 1,000 pages. By the way, if you're going to read this book, don't read the abridged version. It is NOTHING like the unabridged, original copy."
4811,1,Great story of redemption,"Sweet revenge at it's finest.Love, romance, long friendship gone wrong.It's all in here. Not like the movie, so don't beterribly disappointed."
4821,1,60's or 80's,This has got to be one of the most 50ish value movies with the most 80's soundtrak which makes it double great. I love and you will too. What girl wouldn't love to be swept off her feet by Patrick Swayze and in thos pants at that!! WOW!!
4830,1,Love my Dirty Dancing DVD,"This limited edition Dirty Dancing Keepsake DVD collection is a must for all fans of this movie. It has not only the movie but lots of additional footage, interviews, and even screen tests of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey."
4836,1,Where is Patrick?,I certainly enjoyed watching Dirty Dancing over. The special features are nice. Lots of memory. The only thing is there are no interview with Patrick Swayze...really strange...
4839,1,Wonderful,"This is a movie that I have always wanted to see. Not only is the movie entertaining to watch, but it also has an excellent story line. I would highly recommend it."
4845,1,You will like this CD too,"This CD was given to me as a present. I wasnt a fan before, but now I truly love his music. It is smooth, has a beat, expresses emotions once in awhile but is never depressing. In fact, it is such a feel good CD, I recommended it to friends. Dont think twice. Buy it."
4846,1,Buy THIS version (import),"The difference is that there are 3 different songs: Track 6. pop ya collar; 16.TTP and 17. SeparatedThe US version has U R the one for track 15.The most important reason to buy this one is for the song ""separated"". One of Usher's best songs ever. You can't find this song on iTunes."
4851,1,itz a very good album!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ushers best album,ITS MUCH BETTER THEN CONFESSIONS!!!!!!!!!!!CUZ U HAVE 2 SKIP SO MANY TRACKS ON CONFESSIONZ.....GET THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!
4852,1,GREAT MEMORIES,"bEAUTIFUL FILM QUALITY FROM THE ""GOLDEN AGE OF HOLLYWOOD"" WELL WORTH THE TIME AND MONEY TO ENJOY."
4855,1,A Very Fun Start to A New Series!,"I really enjoyed this book! At first, the dry narration - dry in humour, not in interest - was a bit off-putting. I think that this would not have been in the case if the book was written in first-person, rather than third, but as I became more accustomed to her style, I really loved it! And it's always so exciting to start a new series! In some ways, this book reminded me of what I remember from reading Maggie Furey's _Aurian_ a long time ago, and more recently, Maria V. Snyder's books. Either way, I am really enjoying this series and am quite excited to continue reading them!"
4857,1,Another excellent novel,What can I say more. I'm a dedicated SB reader. I love her novels. This is one of the best. Just great. Burcu Ergen
4863,1,Thorough and enjoyable,"One of the best art history guides I've read. Well illustrated, organized and extremely diverse as far as media, styles, and cultures. Fine for beginners, or for people who already know a fair amount about art and artists."
4864,1,I've always loved this movie!,"I've loved this movie since the first time I seen it, the quality and sound is just like being back in the theater."
4866,1,Always Have Popsicles,This is a great gift for new grandparents. I give friends that are having their first grandchild one. They seem to enjoy it. It has cute things to do with kids.
4869,1,A Great DVD!!,"This DVD is For any Diva's fan or wrestling fan or any fan at all.It wa Worth $20.00 I'm A Huge!

4871,1,Sebastian Knight was pretty bright,"A book like this is so full of gems that for all intents and purposes it is without flaw. Understanding Sebastian Knight pretty much means understanding how literary genius works. The book is loaded with humour that will be above the head of most err stupid people. I saw Nabokov sitting and smiling at me at times as I read. The world is full of Dr. Goodmann's - that is for sure. Best to take a long time and read this book slowly, out loud of course, doesn't that go without saying?"
4876,1,If you want to read only one SF-Fantasy book in your life...,"I have read this book 20-25 times, and every time I read it I get something new from it. It's complex themes blend togather perfectly with the books main plot. I particularly loved the philosophy and the treatment of characters and delicate social issues like religon, sexuality and politics. This is a must read for any one, if u read only one SF in your lfie, make sure it is Dune. The only regret that you will have is that the book is only 400 pages."
4877,1,The best book ever written,"I only read Dune this year, but I ended up reading it two timesin a row. This is, by far, the best book ever written in humanhistory. I've made Dune my Holy Book. I've never seen /anything/ as richly detailed in politics, religion, and description as Dune."
4878,1,This book was great!!,"I read Dune when I was in middle school. My dad suggested it. I loved it!! In some points, it was hard to understand, and in others, it almost scaired me, because of the amount of suspence. Frank Herbert had a very complex imagination while writing Dune. There are only two kinds of people, I believe, that could write a book as interesting as Dune. Either a genious or a lunitic. and I don't believe Frank Herbert to be a lunatic!"
4888,1,It's Dune...Top Notch,"I bought this for Kindle, so I have yet been able to recognize the benefit or difference of this version (40th Anniversary) vs. previous versions. As for the book itself, it had been a while since I had read it. Again, Frank Herbert is absolutely amazing in creating the Dune universe...many levels superior to the ""clever"" sci-fi"" prevalent today. My favorite aspect of the Dune series is the contemplation of humans moving toward the Omega Moment, or in other words the process by which humans could evolve in virtual gods. This is a topic that Herbert covered in other non-Dune books that he wrote as well. It is a topic that is more and more discussed even by serious scientists and philosophers in light of discoveries of the epigenome among the fundamental nature of the universe. Herbert was way ahead of his time."
4894,1,Dune,The best SF book ever written and thats saying something as I have been reading and collecting SF books for over 50 years... I just wish that his son Biran was half the writter that Frank was... Anyway I love the entire series.
4923,1,Alternative Reality,This is The MASTERPIECE of Sci-fi.Its greatness is the ability of F.Herbert to create a real world with a realistic culture in such a way that the reader enters so deeply in this alternative reality that begins to think like a fremen would do and he can't look at the sand on the beach without thinking that it would be better to walk in a non-ritmic way because the worm can hear you.So you enter into a world you'll never forget and the words that the Bene-Gesserit say to fight the fear will never let you alone
4929,1,Great movie for my daughter,Bought this for my daughter. This is a good movie if you like classic books made into movies or movies made about those authors.Also good if you're a girl.
4931,1,GREAT MOVIE,WHAT A DELIGHT TO WATCH!AND THE PERIOD SETTING AND COLOR AND PRODUCTION WERE WONDERFUL! LOVED IT!
4932,1,Beautifully done,This is such a good movie and to actually get it on blu ray is even better. Blu ray quality makes even romantic movies look crisp and beautiful.
4933,1,Jumanji,This has always been a family favorite! I purchased this movie for my son as a birthday gift and he was thrilled. AWESOME!
4934,1,A Wild Ride!,"Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, and Kirsten Dunst star in this phenomenal adaptation of the award-winning childrens book."
4936,1,Jumanji DVD Combo,Jumanji is a great movie for all ages. The DVD Combo pack is an exceptional value. Especially for those of us who do not have a Blue Ray player yet. Keep up the good work Amazon.
4940,1,GENIUS BRILLIANCE!,"This is a very soft, beautiful album. I put it in my computer and fall asleep nearby... it's undescribeable. Not much like their past cds, this is late-night perfection, inbetween talkshows and driving through dark cities."
4941,1,Nice Valentine gift!,"Bought this as a Valentine gift for my Secret Sister in church. She will love it! The price was great, brand new item, fast shipping."
4950,1,great,"i used to watch this movie all the time when i was growing up. since i grew up in germany, it took me a bit to find out the original title of it. my husband finally bought it for me for christmas. i already watched it twice. i love it, it is so funny. the quality of the dvd is great. highly recommend this"
4951,1,A Must Have Movie!,I was very pleased with this DVD. It's an excellent addition to any satire/mystery lover's collection. Hilarious dialogue and outstanding actors throughout the film.
4953,1,Murder by Death - DVD,"Wow, love this movie! What a great spoof on all the different 'who done it' movies and characters!"
4962,1,XXX,I'm a huge Vin Diesel fan. So i think it's amazing that he is in another film and i can't wait to see it!!!
4967,1,Love Tiny!,My daughter loves Tiny! She has renamed him Perrito and she makes him play with her other stuffed animals. She received him for her birthday.
4971,1,Above mere books as olympians are above mere athletes,"One feels after reading this book like one has lived an entire extra lifetime and now must get back to one's own life, though wiser and a little more world weary. Somehow it feels out of place to list this among other ""books"", like it's been misclassified or misslabled. This isn't a book, it's rare genius hitting on all cylinders -- a spark from the shattered vessel of the deeper truths of life."
4974,1,stick with it; it's worth it,"I definitely had my doubts while I was reading it, but now in reflection this is probably one of my three favorite novels. If you can withstand the slow first chapter, keep reading - the final chapter is nearly impossible to put down and is undoubtedly one of the most captivating and best-written chapters in American literature. DON'T read this book to learn about the political rise and fall of Willie Stark. Most reviews say that the book is about him, when the book is really about Jack Burden, the narrator. Warren at times is really amazing; his prose in countless paragraphs is as good as or better than any 20th century American novelist. The book is long, and often times slow, but it is a priceless piece of fiction, and I think it would be difficult to find an educated reader who would be disappointed in the end."
4980,1,The not so simple Organization,"Morgan decribes common assumptions about organizations - he helps to reveal the hidden assumptions behind the managers perceptions. What do we mean when we say that 'organizations are like animals'? It is pretty easy to start to think from a metaphor, and end up in literal believing in it (e.g. that 'organizations live and die', 'organizations have evolutions'). Such reifications are carefully described by Morgan - several most recurrent metaphors of organizations and popular organization theories basing on them are clearly described, and their pros and cons are pointed out. Having read 'Images of Organizations', it is much more difficult to adopt illusionate metaphors, and to get persuaded by a biased visioner."
4981,1,What's up with Mother Teresa?,"Actually it is a very funny movie, despite the social content it is bounded, the movie should be also apreciated by the comedy itself, specially the cameo apearences."
4984,1,"A big bang, indeed!","I took the wait and listen stance, and now I can't stop listening! Another great release from the Stones, that does pack a Bigger Bang!"
4989,1,DEFINITELY worth the wait,"Who knew they still had it in them? Mick and Keith can still crank out a fine set of tunes, and there's a great set of them here. To be honest, I can't think of one song that I would skip on this disc. Even the ""Angie""sequel ""Streets Of Love"" has grown on me, and is actually pretty good. Of course, ""Rough Justice"" ""Back of My Hand"" ""Look What the Cat Dragged In"" ""Dangerous Beauty"" and all vintage Stones tunes, and stand out to me more than anything of Bridges to Babylon. The real stunners for me are actually ""She Saw Me Coming"", which some knock as repetitive but I was bowled over by it upon first listening, and Keith's closer ""Infamy"", which has yet to stop playing through my head. All Stones fans should own this, no doubt. Its just a matter of time until this one gets thrown in there next to ""Some Girls"" ""Tattoo You"" and ""Aftermath"". Probably not the big four though, as no one will ever top that batch."
4990,1,It makes me cry because is too good to be truth,"This album is amazing, it could be better but even the Universe has it's flaws...even the Bigger Bang.The fact is that this is a bunch of 60 years olders and THEY CAN ROCK!! better than all the overly-image-created teens that rule the charts this days.This is how music is done kids...and by the way I'm only 28 years old so don't think is your grandpa talking. So make yourself a favor and buy this pice of history...it is really good, very, very good and will bring happy tears in the eyes of those who still have ears."
4991,1,A bigger surprise,"I'll be 46 in January 2006, and have been a Stones fan since I first heard Get Yer Ya Ya's Out when I was about 10 in 1970. I remember eagerly awaiting the release of albums such as Sticky Fingers, Exiles, IORR and so on. I lost interest after Tattoo You, but still kept in touch with what the Stones were up to, whilst my musical tastes broadened.To cut a long srory short, I sit here typing this review listening to A Bigger Bang for the 10th time through a pair of Ultimate Ears UE10 Pro Earphones (the very ones Mick uses on stage). Suddenly I get it, this album absolutely rocks with power and emotion. If I could create music of this energy and turn on huge crowds like these old boys can still do, I'd never give it up.Onya boys, keep going......lets see how far this thing can go."
4998,1,Pity I Didn't Buy it Here!,"""Joseph"" has got to be one of the most refreshing musicals I have watched in recent memory. I found myself knowing the words to each of the songs by heart by the end of the tape. A part of the storywriting I enjoyed was the fact that the teachers of the school where this play is being performed turn up playing some of the characters. That kind of tricky casting work makes a musical even more enjoyable to watch. And, the clincher to my purchase of this tape was, it was by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Unfortunately, I didn't buy it here, and consequently spent more and waiting longer for it. Oh well..."
4999,1,Hard To Find Items,"I had seen this movie on PBS years ago, and wanted a ""good"" movie to show my grandchildren. It's a really good one. I had to go out and by the CD to play in the car while going back and forth to school."
5001,1,"Errors, but great story","I was a dissapointed to see errors on the back cover, but since I paid for the book I read it anyway. I have to say I love it. I couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in two hours. I say buy it. I say read it. It is sad, but it gives an interesting point of view on church today. We spend too much time looking at the faults of others. I also enjoyed beloved.Sincerly,Jaylynn R"
5006,1,Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!,"This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$."
5010,1,"nice eye candy, but not as handy as the other guides","The Eyewitness Travel Guides in general provide lots of pretty pictures and are very nice, but if you want a handy, practical guide to TAKE WITH YOU on a trip you are much better off with the Rick Steves, Lonely Planet, Fodor's, or Frommer's series of travel guides. The other guides provide much better info on logistics like where to stay, where to eat, and transportation. Eyewitness (DK Publishing) makes great coffee table books, and that is what this book is. I recommend Rick Steves Best of Europe, or Lonely Planet's Europe on a Shoestring if you want a more useful guide."
5013,1,very entertaining and worth the money,"I bought this software for my 5-year old daughter for Christmas. She and her twin sister, along with their 4-year old sister, LOVE this game!!! They love everything about it, from the theme song at the beginning, to finding Prince Stefan in the maze at the end. I will admit, it's not super educational, but it does keep them entertained and it's nice to have a ""fun"" game once in awhile that doesn't require them to think too hard! It's also nice because they can leave the game midway, and return back to where they left off by clicking on their name. The names can also be deleted so that they can start a fresh game. They can restore the castle over and over again and have it be different every time. I think it was totally worth the money."
5016,1,Why is SOULWAX ignored by critics & consumers alike?!,"I just don't get it - SOULWAX has been around since the 90s, when they released their ""rock"" debut (on the now defunct Almo Sounds), chock full of should-have-been radio hits, and then when while they got some attention for their ""2 Many DJs"" mash-up/remix bootlegs, when they return to a full-fledged band, as with last year's ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs & consumers alike barely took notice of that album's amazing writing, production, and sheer electro-rock power. Hopefully, ""Nite Versions"" (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release ""Nite Version"" on 12"" of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move. Can't wait to hear what they do TIGA on his upcoming ""Sexor"" debut...?"
5021,1,Ok reference book,"Dated (1980's) so don't expect a lot of current technology for this ancient craft. A pretty good read and part of my collection. This book is also co-authored by Sobon. Of the three (Build a Classic Timber-Framed House, Timber Frame Construction: All About Post-and-Beam Building and this one), you need this one the least. Interesting history but not so much on the construction aspect."
5022,1,Fun and Simple,I really enjoyed playing this game when I went to the arcade. They preserved the arcade feel and kept it very simple. It is a fast paced game that is fun for everyone.
5025,1,Problems with internet - but a good magazine,"I received ""free"" access to the BA web page (all links) with my subscription...however, about every 3rd time I logged on, my username was declared invalid. I had to contact them several times before the problem was fixed. (It was fixed three times, and then it would fail again). The customer service people were friendly and helpful, but it was a little painful to have to keep asking for help.Outside of that - this is a great publication for people that are into fantasy baseball leagues that allow you to draft minor leaguers - or ""long term keeper"" leagues....or if you are just a fan of baseball and really like to learn a lot about the up and coming player.I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the internet problem....."
5027,1,Mask Maker,"I saw this at a store and the cover is probably the best i've seen in a long time. However, you cannot judge a horror movie but it's cover. 9 out of 10 times the movie will suck. Mask Maker is about a couple who buy a home in the middle of nowhere. A long time ago the woman who lived there was accused of being a witch and was killed by the towns people and so was her baby. Her husband whoses face was horribly burned saw the entire event, I might have missed something. Anyways, the man unearths a stick in the graveyard behind there house and the man is resurrected. If you're a person who needs to see someone killed every ten minutes, then this movie is not for you. It's slow placed but the kills are well done. The killer looks like the new Leatherface without muscles. The ending was a typical slasher ending and I guess there will be another part made. I'd welcome a sequel since this did have potential.Overall, a good horror movie that was a little slow paced."
5029,1,NOT the worst American B-Movie,This movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing. There are no blonde girls and the girls that are here don`t trip over the tree roots in the yard. Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what? It was not on a tree root!!!
5038,1,Grandson enjoyed maybe 20 times!,Fine. Boys and the toys or trains I forget how many times kids can watch a movie and then watch it again
5039,1,Son enjoys Thomas and Friends,"My son enjoys watching Thomas and Friends. It's one of the only shows he will sit still for. Having 10 years of the best shows for him to watch is a joy and a treat for him.Thanks again,James Rivers Jr."
5042,1,"Inventive, Nashville-type film","Ripe political satire is experienced in camping Cosmos during 1986 where the apathetic beach campers are more interested in the beauty contest, the closeted gay exercise coach, eating french fries and watching soccer games on the big screen TV than the tirades of a visiting writer along with a frustrated anarchist and his former girlfriend who is also a terrorist sympathizer. The writer gets a pie in his face in a radio interview and the anarchist finally gets a hearing of his propaganda between rounds of a boxing match. Two youngsters fall in love at a sweethearts dance. Of course, the big draw to this film is a brief appearance of late adult film star Lola Ferrari who made the Guinness Book of Records title for having the world's largest breasts. The fantasy scenes featuring her are more attractive than you would expect."
5043,1,Fit great,"The pants are very soft and comfortable. The color holds up fairly well, but I do wish the darker colors held better. I do recommend them."
5047,1,One of Cashmoneys BEST Albums,"This is one of Cashmoneys best albums next to 400 Degreez and I got that work. I like to listen to dis when I`m ridin or gettin ready to go to work. It hypes me up. As a group, the hot boys were great. They all contribute something to the album make it sound hot. This album is a classic. Add it to your collection."
5067,1,Underrated,"This is by far Judd Apatow's most underrated movie. I think that most people went into it expecting the typical Apatow fare, but were disappointed when they realized it was one of the filmmaker's more mature efforts. The film has its share of laughs, as well as moments of sincere drama. Just put yourself in that mindset, and you'll really enjoy this movie."
5073,1,Good Enough,"I have read almost all of Patricia Cornwell's series with Kay Scarpetta and if you liked her other books, you will probably enjoy this book as well. It has the same feel as the others except I find the adultery that Kay continues to commit inconsistent with her strict sense of right and wrong. Marino is always a great character you can easily picture in your mind and I found the scene with the police at the morgue particularly good. The ending was a bit of a let down. However, I'm still hooked and will continue to read her books."
5075,1,"First Cornwell read, entertaining and fast paced","This was my first Cornwell book. I enjoyed the characters in this story and I look forward to reading more about Scarpetta, Marino, Benton and company. The action was fluid and I was never sure where Gault, our killer, was going to turn up next.Cornwell is detailed and this lends credibility to the plot and circumstances. The events are gruesome, but this is a coroner we are reading about, so that is to be expected. Cornwell does not exhaust the reader with gore and that made the subject matter easier to handle.The one criticism I do have is that the story moved so fast that I felt I was sometimes missing something. I think I just have to get used to Cornwell's writing style, and I maybe should have started the series in a chronological order. Nonetheless, a satisfying read, and I would recommend the Cornwell series to others, worthy of 4 stars."
5078,1,Lincoln in a new light,"""Lincoln Reconsidered"" by David Donald 1961History has always been an interest for me. This takes a bit of time and expands on it very nicely. It starts out with a nice introdution about Lincoln and his times, the people he knew and worked with, then goes onto the politics and war. It had some anecdotes that you never see anywhere else. It turns out that Linoln was not a rabid emancipationist, but a pratical president who did things as needed to be done. I wondered before why he only freed the slaves in the states in rebellion: it was because he did not want to alienate the slaveholders in Kentucky and Maryland. I am still mystified as to the reason for the war of northern aggression: slavery does not seem to be the all inclusive answer that mythology makes it out to be, and this book shows some altenative reasons, but does not take a stand, after it is only a collection of essays."
5085,1,great book of chocolate,"I ordered this book several years ago to do a paper. Yes, it is good enough to use as a reference for a college level paper. On a less serious note, it is also entertaining to read for chocolate lovers, and even though I completed my paper and class a long time ago, we still have this book."
5086,1,Grew on a second viewing,"A sort of mix of Percy Adlon's earlier `Bagdad Café' andRoberty Altman's `Three Women' set in Alaska.k.d. lang plays an androgynous miner who falls in love with a straight, private, local German librarian.They both have muddy, tragic pasts that slowly emerge. There are some deeply moving moments,and some wonderful slightly magical realist touches. The cinematography is very good. But while langdoes a surprisingly decent job, I can't help thinking a stronger, more experienced actress could havebrought out even more in this amazing role.That said, I did enjoy this much more on a second viewing. While it bothered me that it felt at times likeAdlon was simply trying to re-create the magic of `Bagdad Café' (odd, surreal setting, quirky out of placecharacters, cinematography that uses color in exaggerated ways for effect, etc.) overall I foundmyself more able to just let go and accept this tale on its own merits. And doing that, it made me smile."
5089,1,Great Stories but a little repetitive,"This is a wonderful collection of tales from South America, which won the Newbery Medal 1925. The stories are for all ages and written to intrigue the reader and whisk him or her to a far away land. Brave worriers, fair maidens, rich kings, evil witches, and ferocious giants are all a part of these tales. My only negative comment about this book is that towards the end it became somewhat repetitive. All the characters became somewhat similar and the plots (although diverse) had similar paths. However, this is a great book for children's bedtime stories, and a treat to the adult who reads it to them."
5090,1,Author's comments,"As the author of this book, I would just like to say that it has been successfully published in the Uk and reached number 60 in the hot one hundred best sellers. It has also sold successfully in Australia, Greece, Italy, America, Japan, Sweden, and is now being published in Poland. In Japan it was so poular that although only published last year it is now being reissued.To Amazon!! Please remove the stars as I do not have the right to rate my own book. I had to put them in so that I could post this as you no longer give the author a right to reply - which I believe you should when bad reviewers slate an author's book.Linda Sole. I write as Anne Herries and Linda Sole."
5097,1,Works Well,"I like the product. Helps trim me down a little under the clothing. The rubber makes you sweat. After a couple days of wearing it, I really do feel trimmer in the middle. The immediate compression isn't as much as my steel boned corsets, but is pretty decent for shapewear. I'd say an inch plus a little more in the areas that need extra smoothing.However, I don't recommend it for all day (10 hour) wear. I'm so itchy by the time I get home. It is cotten on the inside, but it still itches by the end of the day.In terms of fit, I am a 20, usually. Sometimes an 18. I bought a 3XL. It fits fine. I am short and it does indeed go from hip to just under the bust."
5101,1,"I like this, but it hasn't help up well to use.","This is exactly what is says - FIRM compression. I got a size small and my waist is a 28-29 inches. It squeezes you in and you will look FABULOUS. You won't be able to eat much, or bend over, but you'll look great! I wore it under a tight dress for a wedding and after about 6 hours, I had to go and take it off so I could wiggle on the dance floor."
5104,1,Snug Fit,"Great product for giving you that snug fit...it does become very uncomfortable around the waist line if worn to long. I really do like this item, the only BIG issue I have is the fact that you can see the snaps through your clothing...so I suggest not wearing this with a tight fitting dress or shirt, because everyone will know your secret!"
5107,1,"Great, but not for short ones","I purchased it to wear after delivery. Just after delivery I put it on, though I couldn't button every button. But several days ago I was able to button all buttons, a week later to button second line (which squeezes you more). All in all I wore it for a month day and night. It worked perfect, I have no tummy now. The only thing is I'm not on tall side, I'm short, so it was pretty uncomfortable because it was always climbing up and sticking to breasts. Once again if you are on the tall side it will be perfect."
5114,1,"Very, Very Good, But....","....I have a CD version of the original release on CBS Associated and it kicked in three previously unreleased tracks. These were two original tracks by Eumir Deodato ""Latin Flute"" and ""Venus"" and Deodato's fabuloso rendition of Steely Dan's ""Do It Again""... but heck, at least ""Deodato II"" it has been rereleased somewhere in all it's Creed Taylor/Rudy Van Gelder splendor. Deodato's jazzy versions of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and ""Nights in White Satin"" were noted to be two of the best fusion performances ever done when this one came out. Listen for licks by Billy Cobham, Stanley Clarke, Tropea on guitar, and Hubert Laws on flute..."
5118,1,Plenty of action,This is my second Higgins novel and I am reall getting into this world that has been created by the author. I have learned a lot of the IRA in ways that I find pretty entertaining if at times a little fantastic.The story once again centers around Dillon the bad boy of the IRA that is now working for the British. His mission is to stop this family of half British and half Arab bilionaires.The action is non-stop and pretty interestng. It's a quick read sometime that is to the point and nothing really deep.The only compaint that I have is that I want to know more of Dillon but little by little we are seeing more of the character and some character growth.
5124,1,"Decent book, but definately not Hanry David Theraou",It was a good book to read given that is a classical in American literature but I much rather like Theraou's book Walden.
5131,1,"If you get past the first thirty pages, you'll be all right...","This slim book is like a three-course meal, where the appetizer is yak anus tartare, the entree is three-day-old caviar, and dessert is a Three Musketeers bar. That is to say, the first part, the Customs House prelude, is so floridly antiquated and negligible, that all but the sternest high-schoolers who've never had a bar or bat mitzvah will give up and read the Wikipedia plot summary for Monday's quiz. However, once past that interminable overture, the story actually picks up a bit, though it never really takes flight, and the ending is...pat. Hawthorne's idea of the scarlet letter is much more ingenious than his execution: the seed never sprouts as high as it should."
5138,1,The Scarlet Letter,"One ofthe greatest novels in all of literature, The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today. Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we were accustomed, the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society. It is an exposure to a law that tells what to wear, how to think, and whom to love. The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature, hypocrisy, and of undeniable passions.Enlightening and refreshing, the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately, beyond the limits that society sets. A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages, The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time."
5145,1,Better than I remembered.,"I did not remember how good this classic was until I read it again. I originally read it in high school many years ago, and it was better the second time around.."
5146,1,El Gaucho De Nuestro Argentina,Es un libro de puntos muy astutos en relacion al vida interior del pais Argentina. Los Paisanos del Interior como Chaco y Resistencia Puedan apreciar estos escritos de nuestro historia. Un libro muy Importante al juventud hoy dia.
5147,1,"Good, but old","If you keep your perspective in check, this is an excellent resource. Good, basic advice. I was struggling training my girlfriend (I am advanced, she a beginner), and this book made it much easier to convince her that I wasn't crazy with my training advice. It is a simple and clear book, pretty basic, but I am a big believer that 90% of the results come from the basic stuff, and the last 10% is for when you hit sticking points, or reach an advanced level. But the book is getting on in age these days; still, don't let that disuade you if you can pick up a copy."
5157,1,Great Value for Less Money,"I searched hi and low for a desk that would work in my son's small room -- I wanted a desk made of wood and available in honey finish to match his other furniture with a small hutch (as a large hutch wouldn't work)...and at a reasonable price. The Kidcraft Avalon Desk is perfect! I took off one star because I didn't realize how short it was - ok for my 9 yr old son now, but as he grows up I'm afraid he will outgrow the desk. It would be great if Kidcraft offered taller replacement legs so that the desk could be raised higher as your child grows. I feel the desk is sturdy enough to go off with my child to college if were not for the short height! Dear Kidcraft...please make taller replacement legs so that the desk can be ""normal"" desk height for later years, making is a ""Teen""kraft desk ;-). Thanks."
5163,1,"Get off the dead horse of ""old school"" education","To those seeking an outline of what education needs to practice so ""no child is left behind"" this book is a starting point about how people learn. The flow of the book is easy to follow and considers the research findings of how the brain learns in stages of life. Unlike those who consider brain research a ""fad"", I know from application of the knowledge in this book, the influential changes do produce positive results for students. In the world of ""accountability"" the tools of Brain Based teaching will allow students and teachers a solution in ""leveling the field"" for the students from less fortunate environments, which politicians are clueless about in regards the obstacles of ""survivalists of poverty"". I highly reccommend this book to those wishing to ""get off the dead horse"" and provide a productive environment for education in the 21st century."
5171,1,They couldn't leave well enough alone.,"I'm not a rock snob; I just think Ann Wilson is sexy. I always liked this album; my favorite song is ""Nothin at All."" Until I got the CD, I listened to the cassette edition. I was disappointed to hear that at least two of the tracks, ""Never"" and my favorite, had been replaced with different takes. In the case of ""Never,"" I don't really care, since the replacement sounds essentially the same as the original. But the original track for ""Nothin at All"" is definitely preferable to its replacement. First, it's not as clean: Ann and Nancy add some extra vocal stuff that just gets in the way. Second, and worse, Ann sounds out of breath. One of the reasons I loved the song so much was because of the grateful confidence it exuded. That is diminished in the replacement track."
5172,1,Pure 80s,"At the time this was originally released, I worked in a retail store in a department adjoining the music section. They used to play these tracks all the time. After a while, I was kind of brainwashed. It got good to me, so I bought the tape.The tape always annoyed me, because it was so... linear. Couldn't skip the nasty tracks for the good ones easily. This CD release helps a lot with that. On the other hand, I only just bought the CD, and I stopped listening to the tape 10 years ago. It took me that long to remember to buy the CD version.My favorite tracks for ""These Dreams"", ""What About Love"", and ""Never"". This CD is about as pure 1980s rock as anything I can think of. Buy it if that's what you're looking for."
5178,1,Love the Music,The score by Vince Guaraldi is one of my favorites and the story is sweet as well. There's a second bonus episode included tht I hadn't expected.
5182,1,Patricia Scanlan does it again!,Another great read. You can really identify with the characters. Lots of ups and downs as in real life situations.I have read all of her books now and feel sad that I haven't another one to look forward to.I find she write in a nice easy manner and the connection between family members is so real. I would recommend this to any female looking for good story to curl up and read.
5196,1,Adapter For The People,"After my Apple adapter finally went to the big orchard in the sky, I was overwhelmed with grief coupled with the desire to not pay full price for its replacement. A quick trip to Amazon and some button mashing led me to an old ally (pun intended) Macally and the PS-AC4. Click. Purchase. Consumer joy. I would recommend this. True, it's not as aesthetically pleasing as Apple's OEM juicer, but hey, what is?"
5197,1,Amazon did not send a Macally adapter...,"Please be sure when you order this product from Amazon that you are sent a Macally charger... I had initially ordered one, but there was a problem with the address they mailed it to, so they sent a second one. I ended up getting both... Both of them turned out to be Macally knock offs and wouldn't plug properly into my computer. Thankfully, I had ordered a second one from Maczone for our other computer and I was able to see that mine was different from that one. I double checked the receipt and packing form to make sure I hadn't made a mistake, and it had my product listed as the Macally PS-AC4 AC adapter. I hope that Amazon will fix this screw up...The Macally AC Power adapter gets 4 starsThe Cheap knock off that doesn 't fit gets Zero stars..."
5200,1,Thank God!,"I love Macs and have had them for years, but I get really irritated having to replace the low-grade peripherals all the time, especially power supplies. The Macally version is great. Smaller, lighter and longer than the Apple version, and half the cost. Works just fine. I've used macally stuff before and it's always very solid and well thought out, definitely fills a void."
5203,1,Top Notch Product,"The Macally PS-AC4 is a great replacement item for the OEM power unit. A bit larger than the original, it provides an easy velcro strap that easily contains the wires or releases them to do their duty. Easy to use with a better strain relief than that of the OEM. The loss of the tell-tale light at the base of the adapter plus is missed, but hte positives out weight this little omission."
5209,1,"Wonderful characterisation, as always","I am a great fan of Maeve Binchy's writing. I love her detailed character observation and how it lets the reader recognise bits of people in her characters. Silver Wedding centres around a 25th wedding anniversary and the plethora of dilemmas such a seemingly straightforward celebration can cause. Anyone who has ever organised a family event such as this will love the descriptions of family politics, and I'm sure many will sympathise with the heroine's family traumas and how being 'the responsible one' can lead to all sorts of complications, not to mention that vaguely disquieting feeling of being put upon. A good read."
5210,1,Silver Wedding,"Started off a bit slow but now I am hooked, not finished yet but cant wait for my next oppertunity to carry on with it"
5218,1,book,appears to be a great book for my 5th grader who loves history. i am sure that he will be able to discuss with his class. Good purchase
5223,1,Best palmistry book and why......,"I have many books on plamistry. Some have too much info to ever retain, some are way too basic. This one is just right for EVERYBODY. Here's why:* The history is brief (about 4-5 pages which is all you will ever need to know on the topic unless you are devoting to major study* The book tells you HOW to give a reading and a SCRIPT to follow. VERY FEW BOOKS DO THIS!!! This is worth it's weight in gold. I typed his script out and left blanks and when I give a reading I fill it in like a 'mad lib' but relevant to age and the palm.* Nothing vague about it. BIG pictures. Excellent area on fingers too.Richard Websters best material is not sold to lay people but this books seems to be the exception."
5235,1,Markham sheds light on 'Napoleon',"In his book, 'Napoleon,' Felix Markham traces the rise and fall of one of the most important men in western history. As a biography, Markham sometimes relies too much questionable references, but as a history, 'Napoleon' ranks among the great works on the subject. The reports of the battles and the men who served the Emperor are first rate. One can almost imagine being at Marengo, Austerlitz or Waterloo, or riding alside Ney, Marmont, or Junot. Perhaps some of the most appealing aspects of this book are the accounts of Napoleon's life after his exile to St. Helena and the events surrounding his death. Markham also shows us how the Napoleonic legend helped to shape post-Imperial France. I would recomend this book to anyone who would like to know more about this facinating historical figure."
5237,1,Very good album,"This is definitely worth coppin. Got some bumpin tracks. It contains a variety of songs, she is NOT one of them artist where all tracks sound the same. 15 tracks, and at least 10 of them are worth bumpin all the time. She has a music video for ""Still Buck"" too. You can download it from her labels website. HoodooLabs.com"
5240,1,Urban Primitive Spiritualism,"This is long overdue. Most people get only so far along in the Modern Primitive scene without ""going native"". Here is a book that gives excellent and easily followed guidelines for anyone who wants more from their experiences as a Modern Primitve. Combining Piercings, Humor and Good Spirituality, this is a great buy."
5241,1,Satisfied Customer,"With the double vibes, this little dude has all the power you will ever need. The wife loves it! The only down side is the size. The ring is a little small, and not very flexible."
5242,1,Excellent writing!,"This book is a fabulous depiction of the Italian nun, Benedetta Carlini, whose drive for ambition in the Catholic church drove her to get the help of her lesbian lover to create the illusion of stigmata. Through this, she moves to new heights of power and respect in the church and brings money and fortune to the church...but upon accusations and scrutiny, she's brought down to pay for her ambition. The story is a tenderly told one. It has feminist elements and deals with the desperate desire of spoils, along with a not-so-pretty picture of the Church."
5246,1,"Great for mp3 phones, not so loud.","A great device, I use it with a NOKIA 9300 it is great.I use it during the gym, I can hear my songs and do not waste a call at all.Cons.: Low Volume, Not as loud as an ipod or mp3 playerPro: Very very confortable, great singal coverage.I you are looking for hearing your mp3 songs in your phone it is great. Watch out that it is not compatible to hear mp3 music from all MOtorola, I tried it with a V3i, and I only was able to use it as a regular bluetooth headset, I could not hear any music at all.I gurantee you your satisfaction."
5247,1,What a useful collection.,"It's good to have all Paine's material in one handy volume. Plenty to read and think about. It's a pity he's not better known in the USA, considering his significance in the existence of the country."
5249,1,Unnecessarily Dense but Useful,"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story is a useful prep for using the software. It's an interesting and complete theory of story too, which is great. The book in general is well worth reading. My only problem is that if it's worth saying, it's worth saying WELL and this book uses twice the number of words it needs. The density of words also confuses the message. I felt, on more than one occasion, that the author was willfully complicating the message in order to ensure more sales of the software.Again, worth reading... valid and useful ideas... enough extra words that it undermines its own usefulness."
5251,1,Great Modern Bluegrass,"I'm a casual bluegrass fan and I really enjoy this album. Dolly's voice is perfectly suited for this style of music and the musicians she uses are obviously some of the best in the business.The only complaint I have is that, at only about 45 minutes, this album is too short. Dolly sings on every cut and I don't think it would have hurt to give this stellar band an instrumental number or two. If this album had two or three extra tracks (instrumental or otherwise) I would have given it five stars.""This album is too short"" could be considered a compliment and in this case that's partially what it is. Although I would liked to have gotten a little more quantity for my money, the quality of the music could not be better."
5252,1,Focus,"Since many music genres, among them the ""Latin American"" traditions from which Lhasa draws inspiration, use a limited aural palette and philosophy as a starting-point for individual compositions, I think it unfair to criticize Lhasa for her lyrical and aural restrictions. I would rather hear her and her band express themselves well using a limited repetoire than to barely-adequately play a dozen styles. That's called ""the eclectic approach"", and it's been far too hyped lately."
5260,1,Bubble Gum Crisis,"This music CD went along fairly well with the action and theme seen in the show, Bubble Gum Crisis. I guess that kind of figures, as it's the sound track for the show, but it was very good. I'm not a music critic, but that is my opinion. If you were a fan of the show, this CD is a must-have."
5263,1,Pretty Good...,"The plot was okay, the characters were great, and the conclusion interesting. But it was not as good as other Night World Books. But still worth getting."
5273,1,McCulloch 1800 PSI power washer,"Super easy to set up and use. Lots of water pressure, tons of hose, and an extra long electrical cord. It also wheels around nicely. I'm excited to use the attachments."
5278,1,Interesting performance,"I bought this only because as a fan, I want all of their material. First off, you'll notice the disc length of 76.46. The band added a keyboard player Graham Maitland for this tour which at first is a bit hard to digest(mixed too far up front)sometimes the keyboards work, other times not. There are some classics here- 'The king will come', 'Persephone', 'Time Was' as well as a few others. Sound quality is average, sounds like a straight transfer with no doctoring with the sound. This is the Mark 2 lineup with Laurie Wisefield. Not one of the best concert offerings by the band but worthwhile. I'm sure the band has some real gems in their archive like the live tracks on the superb 'Distillation' box set. Sadly they are not contained on this disc. If you can get past the keyboards and the muddy sound quality, you may enjoy it. Somehow I feel only the true fans will want this disc in their collection."
5291,1,Enjoyable memoir,"I just got this book and I am having a wonderful time reading the anecdotes of life in Victorian New York with an eccentric father. The humor is gentle and quiet, if you want outlandsih jokes the this is not the book for you.Of course, some of the customs and actions of the characters may seem odd by modern standards but we must remember that everything changes with time and in 150 years, people may look back at our culture and wonder if we were crazy.Still, in spite of its age, the humor of the book has held up remarkably well. Perhaps we all know a ""father"" type, an eccentric and bossy person who is somehow endearing nonetheless.So, don't obsess over the un-politically correct attitudes of the time covered, just enjoy the quiet humor and learn about a time gone by."
5295,1,Working Jeans,They are definitely a man's pair of jeans. Couldn't imagine they would be more stiff and plain then when I tried them on. Good working jeans now.
5300,1,I love this set!,"I purchased this set for myself, because I fell in love with the design. A piece was chipped in the first shipment, but Amazon sent me the replacement immediately. I appreciate their quick response. It might not be the ""every-day"" set, as it is rather fragile(otherwise, I'd rate it 5 stars), but the design is wonderful. A perfect gift!"
5303,1,Mr & Mrs Who?,"I am well into the book and am enjoying it as I am a fan of Belva Plain. However, no where so far do I find the last name of Hyacinth's family or Gerald's family. They are Dr & Mrs Gerald Who? Am I missing something or was this intentional on the part of the author?"
5306,1,About what I expected,"It was about everything I expected because I read the reviews first. I wanted something that would be very inexpensive, but would serve the purpose. So far I have no complaints I have had several fires in my fireplace and it has served the purpose for which it was intended quite well.Each piece is a good weight in your hand, the stand is a little unstable but I just set it close to the hearth wall and its ok.Overall I am very happy especially for the price I paid for it."
5309,1,Stuck With You,"If you are looking for a humorous, contemporary romantic novel 'Stuck With You' is the book for you. The characters are well developed; even the secondary ones are very humorous. It had me laughing out loud in parts. Although the plot is a little over the top, it is great fun and very easy to read; perfect for unwinding after a hard day."
5310,1,A very good resource book for ERP professionals,"As the title sounds, the author explained very well about the integration issues that companies who are aiming to become World Class Manufacturing companies status should look into. I stongly suggest those professionals who are being involved in the ERP business to read this book. Flow chart diagrams represent the best way to describe the integration processes among functional areas."
5311,1,Great desk item,"This item is great for sitting on a desk top in an office, classroom, etc. It arrived quickly and seems to be good quality for the price."
5312,1,Exactly What I Wanted,"I bought this gift for my boyfriend who is going into law school. It was partly a gag gift, but I really did think he could use it to relax when he gets overly stressed. He already loves it and has used it a ton. I love that there are two rakes, and the rocks are appropriate for the size of the garden. There is quite a bite of sand, and it does spill over the edges a little bit when you are using it, but it isn't a huge deal. I can see where other people might have had problems with the base, but this one is just fine and there have been no leakages. I also love the size of this one because it is large enough that you can make great designs in the sand. I had considered going with something smaller, but now I'm glad I didn't because I don't think it would have nearly as much fun or relaxing. I definitely would recommend this for anyone looking for a simple gift that everyone can enjoy."
5313,1,Nice but Watch Out!,"Once I shook it a little to make it the sand flat, sand started pouring out the bottom sides because the bottom wood had pulled away from the tacks or nails. I poured the sand back into the packaging box for safekeeping and took the box home for repairs (I bought it for my office). I still like this item; the size is perfect, the sand is nice and plentiful and the rocks are nice river rocks, not too shiny or too dull. I didn't expect much because of the price so I'm actually happy with it... I dropped a star because of the repairs I had to make. I just wish I had read all the reviews before pouring the sand in and making a mess!"
5315,1,Tequila a mexican treasure,"If you ever wonder how tequila is made, find out what an amazing process it is. Buy this book.Full of incredible rich photographs, that depict the everyday beauty of Mexico."
5331,1,Spiritual guidance from the East,"This is a delightful little book of wisdom. It is a great read for anyone searching for greater spirituality in their life. It is not really a book of any particular religion or Denomination. It is just a bit of guidance from a great master. Krishnamurti does not try to convert anyone. He merely nudges people to seek aims greater than themselves. I find it a quick read that can also be read over again numerous times. In fact, I suggest it be read through once quickly and then referred to sporadically to absorb all the wisdom. It is a spiritual reference book that holds value over time."
5333,1,The Book's Title is Self Explanatory,"This is a great history book on the great Mongol Empire. It clears up a lot misunderstandings and superstitions about the supposedly horrible Mongol barbarians and gives a reliable account of their rule in this time period. It covers Temujin's (aka Genghis Khan) beginnings to the end of his forebears rule. It has pictures from the past and of re-enactments of Mongol cavalry - you will rarely find this elsewhere. The Mongol Empire was a militaristic nation, so this book lacks on the military strategy and warfare of the Mongols. Only the basics are covered."
5337,1,The knowledge of Healing,"The knowledge of Healing was a great explanations of Tibetan Herbs, treatments etc...that truly work, better then our deadly chemicals...they have been used to heal anything and everything since 5000 yrs and more; their correct diagnosis of the different pulses is very effective...treating illness with heat or cold treatments...along with prayers...how can anyone go wrong..."
5341,1,Very Nice,"I got a similar set (3-pc with shaker and 2 glasses). I agree with the other reviews about the shaker, it leaks a little bit. I suggest getting another shaker, but keeping this one around as a back-up OR wrapping a small towel around the leaky seam. I like the texture of the shaker and glasses. It's classy and not so overdone that it's tacky."
5344,1,Useful history,"A useful history of the last days of Soviet rule and the early days of democracy in Russia, told through the stories of several, mostly prominent individuals. It provides a nice portrait of what exists, but lacks deep analysis to answer the question of why."
5347,1,More Z's Please!,This was a cool fast paced indie zombie movie. Would defiantly recommend friends and family to see this film. Would like to see what this company could come up with if given the opportunity to do a second or third zombie film. Oh and the disclaimer at the end of the film about no zombies being hurt during the filming of the movie was pretty neat too.
5348,1,Fabulous,The costume came fast and fit awesome. My only complaint was with the shoe coverings. They broke easily and would not stay on my daughters shoes so we ended up not using them.
5350,1,Great Costume!,This is a fabulous costume! My daughter loves it and has had it on every day since it arrived last week. She even slept in it a couple of nights. The other reviews are correct in saying that it needs some mending. We had to reinforce the velcro on the mask and the elastic on the bottom of the boots. After a little stitching it is fine. We also sewed on a small piece of material to the back of the face mask so that it wouldn't stretch any further and tear. This was a fabulous idea. Do it! I only deducted one star for this because the rest of it is great. The material is a durable shiny pink. My daughter is a size 4 and wears a size 9 shoe and the small fits perfectly. If she were a 5 or older I would get the medium. Totally worth the money.
5352,1,She loves it,"Pink Bat-girl is a hit at our house. She loves to dress up. Costume is a little flimsy but will last through the Halloween season and maybe some dress-up after. Skimpy and thin so plan on wearing something under it. (I wish we had bought a size larger) Don't be fooled by the cape it does not go over the shoulders, only behind the back. It is very cute and my 7 year old daughter loves it."
5354,1,Nik comes into the 90's and away from the Pop,"I was delighted to find this newest incarnation after digging about for his other albums/CD's that were not released in the States and having to get them as imports. The guy would be big here with a little publicity. His lyrics are as ususal clever with twists and turns not found in most artists work. The fave so far is ""Billy"" (which probaby could have been named ""Sally Wants"" just as easily). Keep it up!! and keep cranking it out into the 00's!! Valkomen back!"
5372,1,good dampener with good hitting sound,its a good dampener. I bought it for my head racket which is now 6yrs oldthe reason i bought it was because my racket was getting these little annoying noises when i serveso i tried it on and now the sounds are gone and its also very good for the price
5373,1,"Different Colors than Shown, but works fine","The product photo shows one black and one red dampener, but TennisExpress shipped to me two white dampeners. I was actually hoping for the red and black ones, just to match my racquet, but I do know that is only cosmetic. The dampeners function just fine."
5377,1,Great follow up to From One.,"Ra is really underrated rock band. They have great melodies, good arganments, middle eastern vibe here and there, a singer who is really influenced by Sting and the Police. They even cover one of their songs. If you dig Breaking Benjamin or Alter Bridge, this band is for you. Every song is great, really no weak tracks. I highly recommend this cd."
5383,1,good stuff,"great resource for anyone looking to add variety to medicine ball exercises, increase their overall explosiveness during intense physical activity."
5384,1,Required Reading for all Americans,"Let me be the first reviewer since 9/11 to weigh in on this valuable book. Every American reacted to the horrors of that day in their own personal way and many reflected on the secular foundations of our constitution but few people know the details of the struggle that went into the conception, the codification and the defense of our first amendment. The separation of church and state is the greatest source of our strength as a country; every American should know the struggle of Roger Williams, the history of the Southern Baptists, and the strong belief of our founding fathers in the freedom of choice regarding personal beliefs. All explained in this simple and scholarly book."
5389,1,"Interesting, but requires extra work on the part of the reader.","As many of the other reviewers have said, this book isn't in chronological order nor does it put forth any kind of explanation for the mysterious events it describes - which I myself was rather disappointed by. You can catch glimpses of what Keel might be thinking from his comments throughout - enough to know, for example, that he doesn't buy the extraterrestrial invasion theory and that he thinks that the things people see are naturally occurring phenomena that most people just aren't aware of - but he never really sits down and explains it at length, despite the wealth of information he's gathered and thought about.However, the anecdotes and experiences presented were interesting - and by the sheer wealth and similarity of them, compelling. The nonlinear format might have helped to make it interesting in some ways, even if it distracted in others."
5391,1,SURREAL AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING,"I have never been interested in UFO literature, but decided to give this book a try. The early portions of the book are rather dry documentations of UFO sightings and other paranormal incidents. Towards the end of the book however, things pick up considerably. The author's description of events is credible and eerie. He concludes that so-called 'extraterrestrial' beings are really with us here on Earth but only perceived by those with perceptual abilities that most of us do not have. He also concludes that such beings are capable of influencing and interfering with humans. For books outside of the UFO literature that corroborate Mr. Keel's conclusions I recommend 1) The Active Side of Infinity (Carlos Castaneda), 2) Far Journeys (Robert Monroe), 3)The Path (Esmeralda Arana)."
5394,1,At least she's hotter than hell ;),"Galang is the strongest track here and I'd agree with many that it is no musical revolution. I enjoy it due to the fact it's a WORLD disc and I like World music alot. It's definitely different and I had seen the video for GALANG on the IMF Satellite channel. She's hotter than hell in my opinion so I'll give her a break. ;)And with those criticizing Revolution, America was created on a violent Revolution so I have no idea what they're talking about. When you live under brutal oppression you revolt which none of us in America understand anymore. Thank God we don't have to revolt here like others but people need to study what goes on in certain areas of the globe.Sometimes simple beats are good and this is better than alot of the major Rap trash here without any meaning at all."
5401,1,Timeless classic.,"I just finished Gods Of Mars and am ready for chapter 3. I feel truly fortunate to have ""discovered"" burroughs at 43. The rush of action, the clash of steel and its all mine for the taking. I have been forewarned that perhaps after the first three books it becomes hit and miss but I shall discover that for myself. Do yourself a favor and pick up A Princess Of Mars - book 1 - if you haven't already."
5403,1,Great to see the old neighborhood!,"I would probably have given this book 5 stars if the Belle Harbor section (where I grew up in the 60's and 70's) had been better represented, but still, it was great to see the neighborhood I left as a teenager in 1976!For those that live --or lived-- there, especially if you spent any amount of time in Far Rock, you must get this book.To the authors: issue a revised edition with a more emphasis on everything West of Beach 116th Street... and I'll go 5 and a half stars in my next review!"
5404,1,"Old Rockaway, New York, in Early Photographs.","Simply the only printed information available about the Rockaways of yesterday. It seems that everyone has roots in this once grand seaside community and this book gives you hundred of old postcard views of the towns along the beach. There's not much left there from the old days and even fewer people left in the NYC slum who know how to read or right. So we'll bet that most of the sales of this book will be outside of Rockaway. But if you're heart's at the seashore, then Vincent and William's book should be in your library...EKG, (escaped to Long Beach, NY)"
5406,1,once put together..it's great!!,"This tent takes a little work to put together. I don't know what people are talking about when they refer to the wooden poles and getting splinters as the poles on mine are metal. Anyway, once put together it is quite cool! I am 5ft 9"" and I managed to be able to sit in it along with my 4 year old (sitting) and my 5month old baby (lay down) so there is plenty of space. I got mine on sale at a babies r us store, so I don't think I would actually pay (...)for it though. You could by a basic regular tent for that much!"
5411,1,New Toe jaming sounds,Shows a sense of creativity with sound effects that reveals the artist's ability to be in touch with todays concerns. Loved the Twist!
5415,1,"Great start to a ""Mimi-Series"" Frankenstein","I'm pleasantly suprised. I have read K.Anderson 'novelizations',and been a long time DK fan, and so far I am really enjoyingthe series. I wont re-iterate the Editorial Write-Up. You canalso go to DK's web page and get a synopsis of all the maincharacters. Looking forward to the next installment."
5426,1,interesting reading,When you see an orchestra perform it look like the people in it play effortlessly. This is not the case. They get to be that great through LOTS of practice! In Meet the Musicians we are introduced to 15 member if the New York Philharmonic. They tell us there stories of how they found out they really wanted to be professionals.The book included a helpful glossary and a list of resources for learining.Young musicians will gain useful advise from the pro in this book.
5443,1,Vision of Blindness,"Here Derrida offers a vision of blindness, that is to say a ""vision"" of ""blindness"", or even a ""vis""ion of ""blind""ness. By deconstructing the very ""act"" of see""ing"", he defers to différance, grammatology, and ""éperons"", that is to say, the ""spurs"" by which we harry, that is to say hurry, the horse(s) of structuralized condescension. Perception, that is, or ""interception"", or even ""interperception"" of vision--or more precisely, visuality, and all that implies. Reading, and re-reading, this book, we can easily understand why Derrida and his thought were so instrumental in the fall of apartheid."
5445,1,last minute order,I ordered this at the last minute and it arrived on time. The case was cracked but the Cd was undamaged.
5447,1,Interesting,"This book was interesting. I feel not everyone gets these short stories. The stories are sad and depressing, but that's the author's point: immigrant life can really suck. There isn't always a happy ending. Also, I read this book on my ipad so there were a lot of issues with formatting, which was annoying."
5451,1,An end with a bang,"This is the first book I have read by Sandra Benitez. I have done much research on the the 1932 matanza in El Salvador and some on the civil war. I am Salvadoran and began reading the book critically and from a historical point of view. It began quite slow for me and somewhat sided, but as I read on I began to feel as I knew the characters and their realities. This is an excellent book. The realities of life, love, family, death, and war are presented strongly and passionately. The ending is gripping and seems unlikely, but definately portrays the difficult times of the civil war. Read it, it will provide a fictional story of the lives of some in a war torn country."
5452,1,Sounds Like Santa,The bells are exactly what you think they are and sound exactly like you think they do. My daughter was THRILLED to be able to make her own Santa sounds. They seem pretty durable and are great for the price.
5472,1,Great Quality @ Affordable Price,We used similar type of nipples in the hospital when our baby was born and wanted to have the same with us when we travel from one place to another as being disposable they come pretty handy. Would recommend these not for daily use but when you are traveling. Its good that we found them on Amazon :)
5478,1,music's loss,"When E T A Hoffmann redirected his output from music to literature the world gained a lot. Not only did his literature have great impact with other writers, but his stories became the source of much musical inspiration (Wagner, Offenbach, Tchiakovsky, Hindemith, Schumann, Busoni, Delibes .....). But listening to this CD made me realise the world lost a lot as well, because Hoffmann was a very talented composer. I had previously heard some of Hoffmann's chamber music, such as the piano trio and harp quintet on this CD, and viewed them as pleasant but not memorable. The duettini italiani on this disc are for me, a pointer to greater riches in Hoffmann's music than I had previously seen.Other recommendations:Hoffmann's short stories, and his novel 'The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr'E. T. A. Hoffmann: Arlequin Ballet; Overtures, CPO CD"
5479,1,"Amazing wooden oven and stovetop, great price","Another fantastic deal from Amazon. My son ADORES this little oven. It looks beautiful and comes with a complete collection of food, plates, pots, and utensils. The colors are lovely and it looks a great deal more expensive than it was. My only complaint is that the shelves are not solid in the wood backing. The small plastic bolt comes loose easily. It so far seems to create no structural issues, but it does make the yellow sliding door fall out sometimes. Probably could be resolved easily by adding a real screw to the backing. It is also on the small side (my two year old sits down to play with it), so know what you are getting before purchasing."
5480,1,AN EXCELLENT GIFT BOOK,"Part adventure part encyclopaedia,The Dragon Chronicles is an exciting and unusual book. It will be enjoyed as much for its narrative thrills as for richness of its illustrative detail.The book appears to be a reproduction of an old journal that turned up for auction in a London sale room. It purports to be the diary journal of an old wizard, who to comply with the wishes of his dying king, sets off to find a group of malevolent dragons who are threatening the stability of the land.The book looks and feels like something that has been lying in a vault, forgoten for centuries. The pages are like old vellum and there are dozens of brilliant coloured paintings and sketches of dragons, weapons and specimens, like dragon eggs that were supposedly produced by various artist who accompanied the wizard on his journey. There is even a dried pressed speciment of a dreaded ""Dragnette"" a kind of flying piranha!Thoroughly enjoyable yarn for any age (why should kids have all the fun)"
5485,1,My favorite Kerouac,"Although this isn't the greatest book written by Kerouac, it is easily my favorite he has written. There are many weak moments and contradictions by the characters (Kerouac) but the passion in the pages is hard to deny. He really means everything he writes and believes he is trying to become a better person. All told, it is a fun, romantic trip; this is something that is lacking in today's cynicism."
5516,1,The Marine,Good action the previews show the good part of the movie. Good plot ending could have benn better.
5518,1,NON-STOP ACTION,YOU HAVE TO LIKE THE THE ACTION SCENES AND STUNTS. WILD.... ALITTLE FAR OFF IN NEVERLAND. AND IF YOU LIKE JOHN CENA THEN YOU HAVE TO SEE IT. BUT ALL IN ALL A PRETTY OK MOVIE.
5521,1,Lorna Doone - a Classic !,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this book so readable- even by modern standards it is a good read, although the language in parts is somewhat old-fashioned, archaic even ..... but if you can deal with that, this is a good bet for anyone who would like a tale of England in the late 1600's... love, adventure, and even a little humor too!"
5523,1,"Great product, but a little inconvenient","This works like a dream to find out what song is playing on the radio. There are two problems I have, however. One is the hassle of hooking it up to your computer and waiting a day to find out what song it is. In cities with a large population, the songs get updated every 10 minutes. The other is the heavy flash use on the web site. This makes the process of finding out the song even longer. I do not have a high-speed connection, just a 56k modem. Even with these problems, the great function of this product makes it original and worth your money."
5532,1,Dope.,But divisive statements like the one above (or is it below) about D-12 are not needed in hip-hop. If you can't say something nice....
5535,1,SYNTHASIZED HARMONY,"ELECTRIC SYKCHURCH IS A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF TODAYS RAVE SCENE. WANDERING THROUGH YOUR BODY LIKE A FLOW OF POSITIVE ENERGY. ITS A GREAT GROUP TO LISTEN TO, WHEN THE SUN IS COMING UP, AT A DESERT PARTY. A PERFECT END TO A NIGHT OF DANCING."
5536,1,Great product,"Ordered these for my husband, it's his 2nd pair. He wore the 1st pair into the ground over several years so pretty good value."
5550,1,Protection Advice,"All of Paxton Quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes. Men are usually stronger & larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity. I purchased these books as gifts for the women I care about, as a guide which points them in the correct direction."
5551,1,Very pleased with this camcorder,I just purchased this camcorder used for only $80. It is a great camera for the price. It's easy to use and the picture is good in quality. I bought it as a gift for my son (age 7) and he can handle it well on his own.
5563,1,"Great music, great anarchy","Damn, their still selling this CD? Well, my friend gave it to me a couple years ago. I liked Tubthimping and all, although I wasn't crazy about it. Actually, it's not the only good song on the CD, Amnesia, Drip, The Big Issue, and Scapegoat are all awsome songs, as are most others. Some of the songs never really caught onto me, but most of it is good music. Anarchy rules!"
5573,1,"Still good science fiction, even for 1951","Foundation is great science fiction for the scientific minded, no deus ex machina here. The only fault I find with this 1st book is that the 3 main characters are exactly the same person. Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are the exact same character. All calm, cool and collected. Perfectly confident and perfectly logical. No difference in dialogue and problem solving skills, you wouldn't be able to tell from Asimov's writing that these characters are from different time periods and are from different cultures. For that matter, every character in the book seems to be of the same culture and dialect. I realize Asimov uses a minimalist style of writing, like Hemmingway, there are good and bad sides to this. No fleshing out of characters has to be considered weakness in Asimov's writing. It may have made for a longer book, but his characters would have been better served if they all didn't behave as robots."
5581,1,Foundation Series,"It was a very interesting concept, a bit heavy on a scientific version of ""fate"". This series of books uses the concept of random motion as a prediction for the future was quite a brilliant idea. The story deals with a genius who predicts behavior for millenia into the future and actually has recorded holograms for future people that deal with his predictions. Where I had trouble was the reliance on robots in the later books. I personally prefer the human side of things. It was an interesting read and well worth it."
5594,1,o.k.,It's great to finally have this sitcom on DVD even if it's the first season only. The only bad thing about it is that it has as a bonus the teaser of letting you know that season 2 is coming next spring 2004 and at first I thought as a bonus surprise it actually included the 2nd season!I think this should've been released on a more complete package but oh well....nothing's perfect.
5597,1,WOW,"Wow, was my first word when I opened it up. It is so small. I have not had a chance to explore all its functions yet, but so far it works great and gives high quality video. The picture function is also a great plus. This camcorder is well priced for what it offers"
5598,1,great beginner cam,"one thing to watch out for,when using the zoom button,dont just let it go after you zoom,or it will click and the noise will be recorded. however,if you edit and can dub different audio then it wont matter. that said, we love the camera.ive been thinking about an off board mic for sterio audio,,just for fun. but since this camera is kinda old now,finding extra parts is kinda tough. when we bought it,they were just comming out and then everything was available,but now,several years later,,, well they arent. ebay or maybe canon outlet in the usa.in fact i just bid on a remote for it,we lost the other one. man,they come in handy.id probly also want a clear over lense to protect the main lense from grit and crud. cheaper to get a new cover than new lense."
5605,1,Great Read,"Anyone who thinks that becoming addicted to Valium can't happen to them should read this book. Brutally honest it follows Barbara Gordon, a successful award winning documentary film maker, through her addiction to Valium and her painful struggle to get off. This is a great read. I won this from Goodreads."
5613,1,I LIKE TURTLES,I LIKE TURTLES. And Mad Max. Excellent movie. I like very much. I love him. And the bad guy was good in Farscape.
5619,1,The best of the Mad Max triolgy,"The Australian dialog was dubbed because it was believed by the director that the Aussie dialog wouldn't be understood by American audiences. This is by far the best of the trilolgy. The leader of the motorcycle gang is absolutely frightening. I think the dubbing and the orchestrated soundtrack actually ADDS to the 'alien' feel of the movie. We are watching cultural shock where ANYTHING goes, and it keeps you on edge throughout the movie. FOUR stars ONLY because it doesn't include the original Australian dialog. The sequels are wannabes and don't deserve a SINGLE star."
5628,1,Well worth a read,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this well written, absorbing, researched story of international financial espionage and the potential opportunities that a base-less currency and the global financial world offered by the internet."
5631,1,Mini Blinds something I always put off cleaning.,"With this tool you can keep your mini blinds really clean, the brush reaches into those impossible crevices. And I now dust my blinds on a regular basis to keep them looking really great. I was most pleased with this product, especially since it saves me those extra steps of cleaning!!"
5638,1,Waltz King,Strauss - The Great WaltzThis is truly a masterpiece reflecting upon the life and times of a remarkable composer. We are lucky today to have such talented orchestras who can reproduce Johanns' works with such expertise thus keeping his music alive in our modern times.There is no one illustration of Johanns' work on this DVD as none can be classed as being one better than the other!
5639,1,Very durable puzzle but not challenging enough for a 3 1/2 year old,"I bought this puzzle for my 3.5 year old daughter as she showed lots of interest in puzzles. This is a very nicely made toy, very durable and extremely helpful to have the wooden tray to put it together in. We haven't had any issue with pieces sticking together. My daughter loves this puzzle and takes it apart and puts it together a few times a day. She is able to put it together in amount a minute now.I'd recommend this as a skill level for under 3 years old.I'd also bought one of the 48 piece puzzles which seems at a better challenge level for 4-5 years old."
5646,1,convenient twin airbed,"First airbed I received had a leak, sent it back and got the next one within 4 days. Super convenient to have the built in electric pump and super fast to inflate. Takes a bit of an effort to deflate, but that is expected for pretty much any airbed."
5650,1,It Great works.,It is very comfortable and easy to use. The only thing they could improve on is the storage bag. It should be larger. It is difficult to put is back in the bag.
5662,1,Quick and Easy,"This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in, turn it on, and walk away. The pump is built in, so you don't have to worry about keeping up with an air pump, using a hairdryer, or finding double D batteries to power your pump."
5666,1,I would definatly buy this again,The bed was comfortable and filled easily. It's only draw back was that did not fit all the way back into the carring box.
5667,1,Awesome product but not completely accurate,this product is amazing i took it camping and loved every minute of it ... it is a great product and very comfortable... the pictures show it to have a manual inflating pump like most inflatables but this one does not have that port. Not a huge deal just thought needs to be exactly what is in picture but the actual mattress is amazing and i would definately buy one again
5672,1,Extra rack needed.,Hubby goes to a huge pig-roast with retired and active navy guys every year. Bunks in the campers are prized beyond all else (except the kegs). Our friend was dumped after one of the guys decided at the last minute to not bring his camper. I had a trail of Amazon prime so I quickly ordered this mattress. It was delivered on time. It blows up pretty quick and was very comfortable ( was used by two different people on different nights). It holds air well and over a 3 day weekend only needed a quick shot of air once. I think the only complaint was it was a tad bouncy and one of the sleepers fell to the floor (maybe had something to do with the drinking). When deflating make sure it does not suck onto itself or the pump gets whiny. Fits well in it's well constructed carrying bag. Glad to have made the purchase. Highly recommend for a spare rack.
5673,1,comfortable and easy to use,"With a bad back, it is difficult to get off the floor when using an air mattress. The height of this solved that issue for me. The first mattress we received, leaked and I spent one very unpleasant night. But Amazon paid the costs of shipping it back, and the new one is doing well."
5674,1,Slept great,"My daughter purchased this airbed for my long weekend visit to her one bedroom apartment. For three straight nights, I slept great. It didn't hold all its air all that time but what air mattress would? With the built-in pump, I just had to throw the switch and within seconds it was firm, comfortable and ready for another night's sleep.I also want to mention how easy this bed was to get out of. I have arthritis in my knees. Because this bed is the height of a mattress and box springs, I was able to get up and down easily. This also made it a great place to sit. This product is absolutely worth the money!"
5675,1,Street Index Fine Print,"The street index is hard to read for the over forty crowd. If the font size was 12, it would have been much easier to read."
5679,1,Cal exotics Waterproof J Rabbit,"Good product, made well. Bullet has good amount of vibration. Hits all the right spots. I think the rabbits bullet should be placed a little higher for better stimulation. Also the beads inside are made of steel and if placed wrong can be a lil painful. The product however is worth the money."
5684,1,It's Big!,"It's really big. I'm not too impressed with the rotating dildo part because I really don't feel much and I guess I also feel more stimulation from thrusting. However, those rabbit ears (and the little nose too) are amazing. I can turn it on the lowest setting and it won't take more than 2 minutes for me to have the big ""O"". It would probably be a lot of fun with a partner."
5697,1,Kindle Reader Considerations,"The classic Romeo and Juliet. Wonderful book, wonderful read.Kindle users: This book seems to not be typed out for the Kindle. Instead, it's a bunch of pictures of the text. This results in disjointed annotations and an inability to select a word on the screen and pop it up to the dictionary."
5704,1,Office Decor,Loved the show and use classic movie and TV memorabilia to decorate my home office. Wish I could find posters.
5710,1,an up-close account of a disturbed and fascinating man,This book began with the childhood of Manson and the numerous institutions he's been in and out of throughout his life. It eliminates hype and sheds light on the truth of the madman behind the mask and gives a personal account of how experiences led him in and out of institutions for the duration of his life.
5719,1,WOW!,"This story blew me away. I thought it was going to be another one of those hair books where the women sit around in a beauty salon gossiping, but it wasn't. It was a sweet and touching story about a woman who wanted to be married before the age of thirty-five with 2.5 children and a picket fence. When she didn't get her wish she cut off all her hair. That simple but very well written. I cried at the end so I deducted a point for that. I don't like sad endings."
5720,1,Kept my interest,"""Nappily"" was entertaining!. However, the characters of Venus and Khandi worked my nerves. Both were shallow and had agendas. A lot of time was spent on Venus and her ""finding herself"" which is what we need to do from time to time, but so much time was devoted to this. We were privy to the main characters' thoughts which was an insight into each of them.The book's opening left you ""hanging"". I surprised by the ending. I give the writing a four (which is what reviews are about?). I was not bored!"
5724,1,Solid SF,"I've enjoyed Alastair Reynolds' books since I stumbled upon Revelation Space. I was a bit disappointed by Century Rain - partly because I just wanted more in the Revelation Space series... partly because it didn't live up to the promise of Reynolds' earlier books. I enjoyed reading it, but not as much as I'd hoped.Pushing Ice is an improvement... it's a good solid epic space story. Reynolds has a knack for good ideas and good characters, and it shows in Pushing Ice. There's a particular conflict in the story that doesn't quite work for me; unfortunately it's central to the plot, but it felt a bit forced (like these people should have known better). I could have done with a bit more explanation/exploration of the bigger picture, too. Regardless, I really enjoyed the story and am looking forward to his next book."
5731,1,Itineraries for Touring & Exploring the Black Forest,"Written with the motorist and independent traveler in mind. Carefully chosen itineraries guide you to historic towns and villages, beauty spots and some lesser-known areas. Distinctive page symbols point out the information you need. Useful information gives opening times, transport, currency, accomodation and much more. Color photographs capture the true essence of this fascinating region."
5734,1,Compilation of ballads (with a great late night feel),"This volume is a compilation of ballads taken from albums Joe Henderson recorded in the period 1992 to 1997. The music is supurb - Henderson almost whispers through his saxophone - and provides the perfect setting for a pleasant evening. Those who seek a late night CD look no further! Those who wish to explore Henderson's work of the nineties in more detail should consider buying (one of) the albums used for this compilation: ""Lush Life"", ""So Near, So Far"", ""Double Rainbow"", or ""Porgy & Bess""."
5735,1,Great guidance resource,"Guidance for workout training, eating healthy, and caring for your body with ease and diligence. Recipes for making beauty products and remedies from organic ingredients. Guidance for simple menus and recipes for following a healthy eating program that the family (kids included) can enjoy.

5736,1,My sons really like this toy!,"This was a big gift from Santa to my 5-year-old son and it also gets played with by my 3-year-old son.I put it together in about an hour or so and that was fun for me. The instructions are relatively rotten, but I got it together. I agree that it is not the sturdiest. I had to clamp (AFTER superglueing) two important levels for the rappelling line to work. Whoever was in charge of getting parts to fit together missed the mark.BUT.... I got this toy for $20 bucks and I was willing to do some supergluing...so, the result is a toy that my sons love. There is a lot to do in this Bat Cave and they have a lot of fun doing it.We don't have trouble with it falling over - we just lean it slightly against a wall - no big deal."
5738,1,Who cares...my son LOVED it.,"My son received the bat cave for Christmas. He LOVES it! Of course, it required adult assembly. The adults did become very frustrated and annoyed at the lack of instructions. You would think the pictures would be enough! Once it was up, we knew with one little push, everything would come crashing down. We had to superglue some of the parts AND we screwed it into the wall so it wouldn't fall over every two seconds. The plastic parts do seem very flimsy but I think it'll stand up anyway. My son is only 3 and he loves this bat cave."
5752,1,Quality product,"These canisters are well made and the lids fit tightly. However, I ordered Cinnabar and was disappointed in the color. It is like burnt orange and I wanted something in a deep red color. Be sure of the color before you order."
5753,1,The picture is inaccurate,This product was very nice and I would have kept it had the color been what I saw online. The picture online showed a dark scarlet red canister set and what I received was a bright fire engine red canister set. It did not match my decor so I had to send it back - sadly.
5764,1,What a great toy!,"I had an RCA mp3 player that used cards. I decided to purchase this one based on its reviews and cost. I'm not sorry. The only thing I had challenges with was transferring music from my PC and CD's to the player. I searched and searched and finally figured it out. I think Creative needs to have a picture of the software in the quick guide so people know which window is which.I love the ability to organize and listen to music using several options: genre, artist, etc.. It transfers very quickly (using a 2.0 USB hook-up) and sounds great. I'm just beginning to play with it so I'm looking forward to finding out everything I can about it. It isn't much larger/heavier than an IPOD and is very versatile (not to mention a whole lot less expansive). I also like the fact that it's a ""mini"" external hard drive so I can store large files on it if necessary."
5775,1,Forget What The Professional Critics Say! This Movie Is Funny!,"I have never seen the original old Unfaithfully Yours movie but I saw this remake on HBO and I thought it was very funny! Dudley Moore, Nastassia Kinski and the rest of the cast were great and I'm glad that this underrated movie is finally on DVD and I highly recommend it. Dudley Moore plays a composer married to a much younger woman played by Nastassia Kinski and he goes kind of mad with jealousy when he thinks she is having an affair and has bizarre fantasies of doing her in! But is she really having an affair or is he letting his imagination run away with him? Watch this hilariously funny underappreciated movie and find out!"
5780,1,Great book.,"As a former teenage girl, I decided this book would be perfect for my teenage daughter. I was really surprised when, while talking to my husband, I learned that he had read and enjoyed this book as a teenager as well. (And remembered it, twenty years later!)"
5786,1,Northwinds - 'Great God Pan' (Black Widow),"Northwinds seems to have a good share of originality to their sound.It might be sort of tough to describe their work,but I'll try.A French progressive outfit that blends old school Sabbath with celtic music.Would that formula even fly?It does here.Notice some truly inspired heavy guitar work along with some superb keyboard and flute playing on 'Great...'.A total of six cuts,with each one averaging eight minutes.Tunes I couldn't get enough of were the title track,""Great God Pan"",their Sabbath cover of ""A National Acrobat""(talk about covering an obscurity-great work!!)and the epic ""The Forest Of Koncerei"".A real keeper."
5790,1,"A few kinks, but overall it works well","Unfortunately it hasn't been all wine and roses w/my View but overall I would say that I'm satisfied with it. After having to return my first view due to battery problems the second one I got has worked great. It has been reliable (so far) and it's a breeze to load w/my music, photos and short home videos. The sound is fine with a little tweaking and creating my own equalizer setting. The screen rotates to landscape to show videos so you get the widescreen view, albeit on a very small screen. The wheel works well to glide through the menu as well as volume control. It feels solid though definitely not noticeable on my arm when I'm working out."
5792,1,What can I say!,"I never took up any efective speaking book before. This would be my first. It has been very helpful and comes with examples that really boost your confidence. They let you see the bad, let you feel the good. Then you'll know what to follow and what not to. Recommended for shy speakers. -)"
5796,1,No appetite...,This product does make the appetite disappear!! However it made me very irritable while I took it. I took it for four days so I did not give it enough time to see how the fat burning part worked. The pills were also very long and caused me throat irritation. Everyone is affected differently when taking things so I would say give it a try you will notice the effects right away.
5802,1,A truly gripping book on an almost gripping person...,"The book Helter Skelter by Vince Bugliosi is perhaps one of the best tru-crime books I've ever read. From the story itself, to the incompetency of the LAPD; from the chilling descriptions of the murders to the way the book is set out, you just can't put it down. It's amazing how clsoe to Manson and his three co-defendants Bugliosi gets. If you're interested in true-crime stories, and even if you're not, this is a book to read, if simply to find out how horrifyingly brutal and cold humans can be.4 Stars, and don't forget to check out the photos."
5803,1,Great ballads.,"Very nice playing, especially on the ballads like ""I Got it Bad..."" ""Your Love Has Faded"" and ""Day Dream."" Hodges' solos on these tracks are achingly pretty and Strayhorn's arrangements are elegant."
5804,1,Ellington à la Strayhorn,"A recent documentary has noted that it is difficult to distinguish the respective compositional arrangements of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, so in sync were they in understanding the men of the orchestra and their sound. Perhaps. I have long suspected that Strayhorn soon became the dominant arranger, and this album of well-known Ellington works retooled by Strayhorn may prove the point, though the synergy was probably superior to either's contribution. Aside from such academic conjecturing, this album is outstanding. Johnny Hodges' saxophone is at the fore, with his smoothed-out Bechet melodic lilt. ***** for him! There is a soft, relaxed spirit throughout, evident in Jeeps Blue's and even Juice-a-Plenty. A caveat is that Jimmy Jones is at the piano, so do not expect the minimalism of Ellington or the sensitivity of Strayhorn. The high resolution digital mastering makes this 1961 setting as sharp as a tack. This is a very fine addition to the Ellington collection."
5811,1,it's all happening here,"this c.d is pretty kool it got all the latest hits out, in one so u won't need to buy another c.d this winter. i would recomened this to everyoneso get off ur bum and buy it now"
5820,1,Perfect for Jawbone 2,"Jawbone Bluetooth Headset with NoiseAssassin-Jawbone II (Black)[Retail Packaged]Jawbone Bluetooth Headset with NoiseAssasin-Jawbone II (Silver)[Retail Packaged]These ear buds fir snugly over the stem of the Jawbone II and fit snugly, comfortably in my ear. They were necessary for me to use the Jawbone as it requires both good ear fit and good jaw contact to work at all. Many, like me, cannot achieve both fits with the ear loops and buds that come with the Jawbone.In a perfect world there would be a Jabra gel half way in size between medium and large, but either works well for my ear. I suspect most ears would find a comfortable functional fit with at least one of the three sizes they sell (3 sizes, left and right per package). They only cost a few dollars."
5827,1,Good visual,"I teach Engish to freshmen and we read The Odyssey as part of our curriculum. This movie version is well done and I enjoy showing it to the students. (They enjoy it, which adds to my own.) It stays pretty true to the version we read and the monsters, gods, etc., are portrayed well. The only hesitancy I have with it at all regards Circe and Calypso. There are some brief sexual innuendos/situations with these two women, which there are more of in the story, but generally not in the story provided in freshmen anthologies. However, at the freshmen level, it's completely within boundaries to show it. Watching the movie adds a dimension to the written word, and provides opportunities for comparing and contrasting as well. I will continue to show it."
5831,1,The Odyssey is Impressive,"Considering that this is a TV Mini-Series I am impressed with the overall quality of this movie. The actors are terrific, especially Armand Assante as Odysseus and Greta Scacchi as his wife Penelope. The direction is swift and competent and the special effects are just that, special. I have been teaching The Odyssey for more than 10 years now and I'm glad that someone finally made a film of the story that can show the more visual aspects and intimate scene within this great tale. The old film with Kirk Douglass was awful. I enjoyed this film and so do my students when I have time to show (it is very long)."
5836,1,Good DVD,"Enjoyed it immensely. The sound is best in stereo. The DTS and 5.1 mix are both done poorly imo. But, the stereo sound is very good!"
5837,1,Great to learn lowercase letters,"We had read the original book before, this one is half that story, but it is long enough for a little one to work through each page with the magnets.My favorite thing about this book is that it teaches the lowercase letters (we had mastered the uppercase ones already), and this was a very useful tool because she loves to work with the magnets!It was easy for her to confuse 'b' and 'q', and 'd' and 'p' as they are from the same mould (but different colors)."
5838,1,I liked it!,"The other fellow said Patrick Stewart hammed it up too much, but I actually liked him in this part. I read to book too, and it is mostly ""everything you ever wanted to know about mid 19th century's understanding of whales... and more."" Limited action in the book. But I thought they did a pretty good job of creating the movie around the action in the book, and followed the story well. I have not seen Gregory Peck's version of Ahab, but I thought Patrick Stewart made a good madman."
5840,1,Favorably impressed!,"This little heater works far better than I'd hoped. I tested it in my toughest space, the 10 x 40 glassed front porch. For three nights, the outside temp was right at 27. The radiator on its highest setting kept the porch temp at 60! In other, smaller, rooms getting a cozy heat is no big deal. The only noise it makes is an occasional (low) click. I'd have given it five stars if the dial were easier to read, and it had a handle on both sides instead of one."
5847,1,Great start to a series(Monk).,"Introduction to a series which obviously became rather popular. This offering peaked my curiosity enough to read the second in the series. However, that is where I had to stop."
5851,1,Not quite Gone with the Wind.,"It was interesting to read The Foxes of Harrow again, as a ""senior citizen, since I was only in my early teens the first time I read...and enjoyed...the book. It is quite sensual, considering the year it was written. It has held up fine during the years. I probably understood the nuances better as an adult than as a teenager. Frank Yerby was a brilliant writer, and in this book he presents a balanced view of what white slave owners and their slaves faced during that pre-civil war era. I couldn't help comparing it with Gone With the Wind as I read it."
5852,1,A book that long? Are you kidding me?,"Yep, that was my reaction when I first heard of the girth of this book. I tend to believe that if you can't write a good story under 600 pages or a very little bit more, you can't write a good story period. I stopped picking up any book over 600 pages by authors I didn't already like years ago. And even though I really like the work of Lackey, Flint, and Freer, it did take me a few weeks to go get it and then read it. I read it in about two and a half days, a better pace than many a book half it's length. The characters are all worth reading about no matter who you fell most drawn to. The world is a little harder to adjust to than the run of the mill (DRECK!!) stuff that is usually based on northern European mythology were English is the norm and German and French are thrown in for 'culture' and 'scope'. Not only a good read but it has put any follow on's into the top portion of my must buy list."
5861,1,Under The Tuscan Sun,"This is a wonderful movie for those who have experienced loss, pain, and are on the road to the amazing good things that can happen...and do...in life! I loved this movie and just bought a copy for myself and my sister, who is a hopeful (and married) romantic! Very insipirational and moving for me. Would recommend it to my best friend!"
5877,1,item not the same as in the image,"not the genuine canon battery, but usable. the item received does not have ""canon"" on it, just like any replacement battery."
5879,1,Jane's Chem-Bio Handbook: A useful tool,"Among those involved with the planning and implementation of specialized, multi-casualty incident response, this book is quite useful. Field personnel, command staff, and planners - all will find it helpful. I found it to be concise, packable, and physically handy. About the only thing I'd change would be to laminate the pages for weather resistance.R.D. Lopez, Emergency Medical Services and Disaster Specialist, Dept. of Public Health"
5885,1,Vital Signs,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. Ive had it on VHS for years and am glad that I was able to find on DVD. Im a sucker for medical, and romance, this offers both."
5886,1,Sheets are great considering price,I think these are great they're nice and soft. That being said I'm not as picky as others. Picky abpit certain things but sheets aren't one of them!
5888,1,Sheets OK - package/label looks really cheap.,"The sheets seem fine but the packaging looks like something you would see at ""Dollar General"". They come off looking very cheap - not a big deal at all really unless you are giving them as a gift."
5897,1,"Not at all what you'd expect from fantasy, but...","still well worth reading, whether you are looking for something light to take the edge off a long day at work or something a little heavier to pose a few interesting questions. Small Gods is the only Discworld novel I've read, so I can't compare it to the rest of Pratchett's work, but it grabbed my attention and held it. It's a many-layered book, but Pratchett doesn't force the reader to go any deeper than they feel like. Knowing Latin is an asset in reading (he can come out and say more adult things which he leaves implied in English.) Also, this book doesn't have either a ""British"" or an ""American"" feel, which so much fantasy falls into. Overall, excellent."
5903,1,Compact Version of a Solid Translation,"If you are looking for a compact, pocket-sized copy of the New Testament, Psalms & Proverbs, this is a good one. The ESV is a respected, accurate translation. This copy is nicely bound and should last awhile with careful use. Of course, given the size, the text is on the small side. But that is the concession in the purchase of a pocket New Testament. Finally, the price is right."
5913,1,Possibilities in the Future,"Although the PET's are an interesting concept, perhaps you (the customer) should wait until something more hi-tech such as one with a laser pointer acsess and the Net Nabby actually communicates with you. There would also de much better graphics. This computing power isn't feesable now, but if you wait it'll be worth it."
5933,1,What a collection of artists!,This fundraising concert has the most amazing collection of artists you would hope to see in any concert. I saw a more recent documentary about the career of Sir George Martin that actually showed his Air Studios in their derelict state in Montserrat today after the cyclone all those years ago. Such a pity given the historic music that was produced there.
5937,1,Works,"5 stars for functionality. This works perfectly on a Canon SX50 67mm Adapter ring. The only thing I don't like is that it's hard to keep in your hand when removing, but I feel the same way about the original lens cap that came with my camera."
5941,1,Enter Slayer,"Like the famousMetal Massacre, Vol. 1, which is noteworthy for introducing the world to Metallica, Metal Massacre III's major claim to fame is that it unleashed thrash legends Slayer.The early Metal Massacre compilations are the best reflection of the American metal scene at the time, as such this 1983 release is full of power, traditional, and proto-thrash metal bands that are all clearly influenced by the NWOBHM scene. In addition to some of the ""name"" bands like Slayer, Virgin Steele, and Bitch, Metal Massacre III featured bands like Snowhite (later Znowhite) and Warlord that developed a cult following, as well Medusa, Test Pattern, Sexist, Marauder, and La Mort, who appear only on this album and were never heard from again.A lot of these bands and songs are raw and unpolished, but that was part of the charm of the early 80's metal scene. These Metal Massacre albums are a great way to revisit that era, and are a must-have for all old-school metalheads."
5946,1,Great product. Can find other options for less,"Bought this exact replacement for the camera battery that I lost. I also bought another version that was 1/4 the price just out of curiosity. While this one works great and I would recommend it. I would recommend the other one more because of the cost and it comes with car charger. Either way, cant go wrong"
5948,1,Canon CB-2LX Battery Charger,"Charger was an original OEM, but not the excact one pictured. it came with an axternal power cord. it was still a good deal, not worth fighting over."
5956,1,Awesome system,Great sound in all ranges.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is b/c my iphone doesn't fit in it very well.It would be nice if the manufacturer could provide an after-sale attachment for new ipods and new iphones.
5957,1,Brilliant design,"I purchased the IM7 harness and absolutely love it. It is solid and unobstructive for controls and speakers. For fun I even swung the unit, with IM7 in place, around in circles about 8 times at high speed to test its ability to stay secure.... NO PROBLEM!!! Hope you all enjoy yours too.Altec Lansing IM7 Speaker Shoulder Harness"
5959,1,Stylish Thriller With Crawford at Her Best,"Joan Crawford delivers one of her finest performances in this 1952 suspense thriller. ""Sudden Fear"" has all the classic noir trappings, with enough plot twists to keep you on edge. Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame are a perfect match for Crawford's cat-and-mouse theatrics - guided by David Miller's razor-sharp direction and Charles B. Lang's Oscar-nominated cinematography. Despite a less-than-stellar print and no extras, this Kino DVD is highly recommended."
5960,1,A Wake Up Call,"I enjoyed this book very much. Saw a lot of myself in the pages. Some good and some bad, I think all females should read as rite of passage. Will enlighten and encourage a different behavior. A book that should be read and passed on to others."
5972,1,Great DVD,"This is a great DVD, I almost thought some parts could be a little longer. I liked the questions from the participants, but it would've been nice to have a ""most asked questions video as well""."
5975,1,Educational & Entertaining,"This DVD is not only super informative, but presented in a way that dads/moms can understand and even recall. If you have about an hour you can watch an entire session... and there are six in total. Only wish it came with a workbook or 'cheat' sheet of the helpful information."
5986,1,An important addition to the mushroom breeder's library.,"This book is oriented toward those interested in developing improved strains of edible mushroom species. Highlighted species include Flammulina velutipes (enokitake), Lentinula edodes (shiitake), Agaricus bisporus (common white button, portabella, crimini), Coprinus cinereus (woolly inky cap) among others. Caution, this is not a how-to-grow book, but a technical reference for breeders. Reviewed by THE MUSHROOM GROWERS' NEWSLETTER, April 1993 issue."
5995,1,NUCLEAR WAR!,"A must-have for any fan of Thrash Metal. Blacky's meat-grinding bass sound and Snake's Venom-like vocals will make you wish you were born a Voivodian. However, the production sounds somewhat inadequate. Having seen Voivod live this past summer perform two of these tracks (""Nuclear War"" and ""Voivod""), I thought they sounded MUCH better in concert than on the album. Still, it's WAR & PAIN!"
5996,1,An 80's classic!,I don't know what it is about this movie but it's a classic 80's flick! Mark Harmon is at his best. The plot is a little predictable but it's entertaining and takes you back to the decade past.
6000,1,"Totally nutty, but thoughtful satire, poignant and goofy.","I thought this movie was hilarious. Depardieu, who usually plays more serious roles - had me laughing hysterically. Behind all the silliness is an intelligent satirical commentary on business, lifestyle choices, over-the-top political correctness, hang-ups. Everything gets made fun of, still poignant and totally nutty. A gem."
6001,1,Bed wedge is perfect size,"The bed wedge, combined with a Brookstone neck pillow, is giving my asthmatic husband the best sleep he has in years. The slant is gradual, and the pillow is wide enough to accommodate a man's wide shoulders, and still leave ample room for me in our double bed."
6002,1,A big read - if you have the time,"I'm almost finished this book and can't wait to get on to the others. This is entertaining, engrossing and educational. It has taken me forever to get through it but I'm learning so much about our ancient ancestors that it's worth each page."
6005,1,This is an amazing book.,"This book was required summer reading 2 years ago for my english II AP class. I thought it was really an amazing book. I loved the main character how strong willed she was even though she was more human and not cave man. I thought Auel did a great job writing it, but sometimes she was too descriptive about setting of the story. Description and imagery is good, but too much of it takes away from the story. I have read the rest of the series, but if you like this book you should read the others that go along with this series.thank you for your time,Loran"
6007,1,Wow...this is one of my favorite books ever!,"The Clan of the Cave Bear is very, very good. However, I only gave it four stars because it is a bit long-winded and its sentences run on. (It would have a long phrase, a comma, and then another long phrase. It got kind of tiring.) Ayla's abilities do not seem unnatural to me; Jean Auel did an excellent job of sculpting them into the story. Whoever said that Jean Auel ""really, really wants to be blond"" is sadly mistaken."
6008,1,Amazing,"It was a co-worker who recommended to read this series.. I was sceptical at firstespecially as my Husband said he had the hard copies, and I didn't even know it.But once started, it was not easy to put down. The description of events, surroundings and the Clan people, were amazing..so much so I bought the second book ""The Valley of Horses"".."
6012,1,Interesting,Interesting and a very informative story about how the Cave people survived. The writing was somewhat elementary and repetitive but with a good plot. I would not read the second book in the series.
6014,1,Couldn't put it down!,There is something both mundane and exciting about this book. I read it cover to cover. I couldn't put it down. It's a beautiful story and the author has put so much research into it. A must-read for all women interested in prehistoric culture and even men who don't mind books with a good believeable heroine.I first started this book when I was 17 but couldn't get into it at first because of the apparent mundanity of the story. But I discovered later that the beauty is in the details with this book. The characters and the author's descriptions of the landscape and culture of the people are just wonderful.I highly recommend this as an addition to a fantasy collection.
6016,1,Cave Woman,"I had the misfortune to read the other three books of the series before reading clan of the cave bear but that did not detract from the joy of reading this book.Ayla's story is just that,although the author has written about our ancestors one should not take it as a trueism.Ayla's constant fight for survival and her success inspite of Broud's dislike for her,simply because she is diffrent from him helps push the story along.Their battle of their will continues even after her brutily beats and rapes her.Her decision to leave the clan inserch of her own is out of selfpreservation,leaving her son is hard but so necessary.The book is highly intresting and this authors eye for detail is truly awsom.Keep on Mz Auel.There is a rumor that there is another book in the works.Hurry PLEASE."
6022,1,life,"what a wonderful movie for people that wants to watch how complications of life cam evolve into something that will will change your ideas for how YOU want things to be, and still be ok with. It could possibly happen in real life. bitter sweet. I cried but could also see the sweetness in how their lives completly changed pathways from how they thought it would be and how old roads ended up meeting again. It was all about life's ups and downs and about the message of staying to telling the truth and how people cope with that. I enjoyed the movie."
6027,1,Very solid and fun game!,"This is a great game, a very good mix of turn based strategy and action. You play by moving your team around the grid, choosing what to do and then see the results. (Turn based strategy) From there, they give you up front action of the players in combat, etc. It's a good fun game. The only down side I see to to it is sometimes you really wanna dive into the game and they make you run through this long history/lore of the game to give you some background. So far, I've been unable to find a way to skip it aside from just pressing buttons until it goes away and lets you play. That is why I'm giving it 4/5 stars. Aside from that, great game. I'm playing it on my Wii with a GameCube controller and memory card. (Required if you play on the Wii)"
6035,1,whoa,"Some people find have bad taste in music and for the rest there is Sea and cake whose originality and creativity is a rarity these days. No cool videos or haircuts not even a cool belt! but some damn fine music. just listen to ""all the Photos"" MAN!! Some people find this boring and i feel bad for their simple minds that cannot wrap around the sea and cakes sweet melodies. the colony also is fabulous among others."
6037,1,Outstanding Rock Album,"Picked up the album after I saw the band play with Clutch and COC - Very cool, mellow rock groove throughout... Kind of a funky COC/Gov't Mule kind of sound to a lot of the songs... Excellent choice for fans of ""stoner rock,"" especially ""Fear Death by Water"" and ""Poor Robert Henry,"" which have a definite old-school southern rock feel to them... Check these guys out, it's worth your while!"
6038,1,A new beginning...,"This was their first true recording project, although it was thier second full album. I give this album four stars, because, though I love this album and this band, Five stars would mean it's an album that stands next to Physical Graffitti, the White Album, and a select few other records. This album is a must own for fans who enjoy any of the splinter disciplines of what Sabbath, Hendrix, and Zeppelin started. An album worth the money, with many great songs and performances. If there are any criticisms, one would be the production. It leaves some room for improvement. Beyond that, I hope this band can continue to build upon this awesome release for years to come. Purchas and enjoy!"
6041,1,close encounters of the sexy kind,"As a nerd, I'd always dreamed that a race of nymphomaniacal superwomen would descend upon me from space and probe me to no end. Until the night it happened. It turns out excessive probing can be quite painful, not to mention humiliating. Femalien offers those nerds too scared to undergo sexy alien abduction a legitimate erotic alternative. Three billion thumbs up."
6052,1,Great Blu ray! Exciting flying sequences,"I have watched this movie 3 times. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The only complaint I have is the fact that the german tri planes are almost all red. Which is totally inaccurate. The only plane that was red in reality, was the Red Baron. Who was not even in this movie, otherwise all the americans would be dead. roflol:)Seriously though, the fighting sequences are great to watch, especially when you see the bullets flying through the air. If they would come out with more movies like this one, with the same technology, that would be great. Maybe less romance, and more flying action. the flying sequences were too short in my opinion. Worth buying and enjoyable!!"
6057,1,This game rocks!,"Ok, for all those people who aren't good at playing video games and would like to stick to the unrealistic NBA live 2003 where it takes you 3 seconds to get down court, stay off this game. NBA 2k3 is a great game. I could do the franchise mode all day! There is great graphics, and great gameplay. The ESPN setting makes it even better. For sega sports fans this is a great buy!"
6067,1,Well Worth Having,"This book is a really nice reference book for the backyard birdfeeder. It's not just a bird identifier book, it has chapters on bird survival and behavior. I'm glad to have it my small bird library and refer to it often."
6075,1,A Film From My Childhood,"I first saw this film when i was younger in the summer at an activity centre, and from that day i bugged my parents until they bought it for me. I have owned it on video for several years and i constantly watched it, so when it came out on dvd i jumped at the oppurtunity to purchase it. The story is about a lawer who is put in charge of a hockey team as his community service assigment. Gordon hates kids and he hates hockey. When Gordon was a child he used to play hockey so he is going to be a good coach if he could just get over the fact that he doesnt want to be there. This film is a laugh a minute with childish humour that still makes me laugh now"
6077,1,WELL DONE RAY J.,"This is a good come-back from the 'This Aint A Game' album, that album was good wit songs like 'wait a minute', 'where do we go from here', 'wet me' and 'formal invite',etc. However, this album is even better. You can tell that he has grown up on this album. I think he is making a name for himself in the music business, and wont just be known as Brandy's kid brother. My fav tracks on this album are: 'Exotic' - love this song 2 bits cant get enough of it. 'In tha Mood', 'Anytime', 'One Wish', 'What I Need' and the crunk track 'Keep Sweatin'. However, there are a few dodgy tracks on there like 'Quit Actin' - i was excited when i saw R. Kelly was on there bt was sadly disappointed when i heard it. 'The War Is Over' - i liked the last duet they did 'another day in paradise' bt after hearing this song they should have stopped then. However, overall its a good album ... WELL DONE RAY J."
6078,1,good stuff,the product is cute and just what i was looking for. they were very helpful when i called and asked a question prior to making my puchase.
6082,1,One Reason and one reason only -ONLINE HOCKEY!,"Following up to the excellent 2K2 on the dying Dreamcast, this release will finally allow all the hockey fans out there to play online with XBox Live! This will be the only hockey title to have this feature. I can't wait to play against my brother in Toronto and not have to wait for him or I to visit!"
6091,1,Wonderful Stuff,"This is a superb album with some brilliantly written songs that I find very easy to relate to. Raymond always writes songs from the heart and if more people knew about him they would love his music. Okay they might be quite simple songs but they all have something to say and although Country and Western is not really my thing, this to me is different and I don't see it as Country.I have grown up listening to Raymond Froggratt and there are some songs on this album I find hard to listen to, as they can be a bit cheesey but songs like 'everybody is losing' and 'you sing so blue' are beautiful songs which say a lot. Definately worth listening to if you like songs with good lyrics that come straight from the heart."
6092,1,Good Historical Fiction,"The year is 1852 and we follow a wagon train as it wends its way across the country to the Oregon Territory. Along the way we experience Indian attacks, disease and much death, and some good things as well - romance and bravery. Binns tells the story well and with great feeling for his characters. He has a great feel for the trail as well: it's said that before writing this novel Binns drove a good distance across the Oregon Trail, seeing the sights he would later write about first hand. As a work of literature and not just a genre piece, this novel succeeds handsomely."
6094,1,riveting dvd for toddlers,"my 22 month old son is somewhat interested in Elmo's World on Sesame Street, but he was riveted to this entire DVD about Firehouses. I don't know if he grasped all the concepts yet, but it's a decent DVD with solid safety concepts in it about fires & firefighters."
6095,1,Very Good Western,Randolph Scott and Budd Boetticher combine their talents once again to make an exciting western/civil war movie.Scott is ask to leave his Civil War duties back east to run a stageline full time to deliver gold to the union.The transfer from the Warner Archive line is beautiful. Very crisp and colorful.All-in-All gets a B+ from me.
6097,1,"Lovely color, pretty horses, great cowboys","One of the better Roy Rogers films, especially for fans of Trigger. When diamond-smugglers hide their stolen treasure inside the horseshoe of a gorgeous golden mare, Roy Rogers and Trigger are hot on her trail (Trigger for reasons other than Roy's, obviously). When Trigger is accused of murdering one of the smugglers, Roy takes the rap and goes to jail. The plot takes on more curly-cue twists than the designs on Roy's fancy saddle when the mare gives birth to Trigger Jr., and Trigger is taken by the thieves. Roy, finally out of jail, uses the colt to catch the bad guys and get Trigger back. If you're a real Trigger fan, don't miss 1946's My Pal Trigger, which follows the prized palomino from his birth through his first meeting with his pardner Roy. Another great Trigger movie moment is in 1952's Son of Paleface in which he costarred with comedian Bob Hope.Staci Layne Wilson"
6101,1,Monster Rancher Advance 2,"The agme starts out with good game play, but after a while you lose the needed story line."
6103,1,brilliant pop nostalgia,"calm, soothing, comforting. listening to this just now put me back in the womb of the dreamy days or 80's brit pop. my friend said it was depressing to him, but not to me. it put me inside an atmosphere that felt familiar -- but most definitely not a depressing one. the vocals, the music...it's all so lovely!"
6104,1,Works as expected,The camera works fine and was easy to setup and use. I'm not good with distances but I'm guessing the range was about 200 ft
6118,1,1984 Review,I thought the book 1984 was great. It really made me think about weather or not I was pro Big Brother or con Big Brother. At the end of the book I decided to diagree with Big Brother. It is too powerful and controling. There are some forms of Big Brother that we think nothing of and don't even care that they're around even though there it's watching your every move. 1984 was an awsome book that kept getting better and more interesting with every page.
6120,1,"Now, more than ever, you should read this book!","Pros: This book seemed to be a science-fiction book about the future, but in truth, it was a sci-fi symbolism of totalitarianism in Orwell's time. Yet, this book is so timely today! It reminded me of the way Bush and friends control our thoughts with smart words; GOOD Americans believe in the war and TRAITORS believe in other causes. We should always keep our own opinion and forget the always-swaying popular opinion. And that was just ONE of the many things I learned from this great book! I highly suggest this book.Cons: It was a bit repetitive and it's a very heavy read."
6125,1,Good but not great,"I think Orwell spent 2 much time on developing his world and his own language (new-speak) and not enough time on the story and chartacters. This is quite a simple book and very stright-foreward. The characters seem unrealistic and not very likeable, but his world is amazing in it's intricate structure. He planned out Oceania down to the very last detail, If only he had spent the same amount of time on the story and charactersthen This would have been a definite calssic, but as is, I still cannot say I found it as amazing as the other reviewers. But this is a great introduction to literature, just don't take it in a classroom setting as it kills the enjoyment of reading it"
6128,1,21st century reading,It was interesting to read this book again in 2006. It is fascinating to read this book and then analysis and compare the different governments in today's world.
6150,1,love it!,"I always have a hard time finding a concealer that is just right. But this concealer I found years ago, and I've been using it ever since! I have dark bags under my eyes and this concealer helps lighten them up. Definitely recommend it!"
6160,1,Chilling & Fast Paced,"As of now, this is Leonard Goldberg's last book in the Joanna Blalock series and, in my opinion, the best yet. It deals with a very touchy subject: Smallpox & Terrorism and bits of 9/11 are added in the book as well. Joanna Blalock, a forensic pathologist at Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles is called in by the FBI to do a top secret autopsy of an unidentified man found murdered at LAX, Joanna and Jake fear that they are once again being pulled into another terrorist investigation; the previous one having nearly cost Joanna her life. While the investigation into the corpse's identity is in progress, another emergency intervenes when a man with symptoms of smallpox arrives at Memorial and everyone who has had contact with him is quarantined in the hospital's basement isolation center; including Joanna.Based on a scenario that has all the makings of a very real nightmare, Leonard Goldberg has put together a top notch medical thriller."
6161,1,Good Book!,"I'm a huge Anne Rice fan, and I bought this to add to my collection. She has a style of her own. If you are a fan, I would recommend adding this one."
6171,1,Fahrenheit451 is a great book and I would reccomend it,I gave fahrenheit 451 4 stars because it was an interesting and thoughtful book. It shows that books have been an advent to all major ideas.Without books creativity and thought would be stifled. Ray Bradbury`s classis story is a sure bet for good reading.I deducted 1 star because the book was sometimes hard to follow but don`t let that deter you from reading it.
6173,1,A Mindless Zombie,"Irony without imagination and the will to think for yourself.You're just a mindless zombie, a puppet for people to control you. Inmy opinion, that's what Ray Bradbury is saying in his book. - J. Litton, BDHS"
6177,1,Is this where we're headed?,Another book I read as a young man and dismissed. The book is so spot on. The difference is people tend to be obsessed with PDAs not walls in their homes.
6178,1,really good,"this was a good book. the part called ""coca""is the best (about cencorship) the book is kind of like ""the giver"" only a lot better."
6181,1,Fiction?,"I was first introduced to Ray Bradbury when I took up The Martian Chronicles at my community library. I was impressed. Now, several years later, I finally read Fahrenheit 451.The book is divided into three parts, and the first two were absolutely excellent. (The Afterword and Coda were, as well.) The third part of the story, however, lost me. Ray Bradbury decided, partway through the section, to abandon the easily flowing narrative that he had established in the rest of the book. Instead he picked up a very difficult to follow inner dialogue that lost my interest. Which made it even harder to follow for the rest of the book.But, Bradbury deserves a gold star for his insight into how society is working today (which he foresaw several years ago). We are giving up books and stopping thinking. Remember, at first, the government didn't have to burn books... People just stopped reading them.Love it or hate it, this is a book that rings with truth. And, whatever you do, don't burn it."
6182,1,something special,"A nice easy read for someone who may be interested in a futuristic fun read. Guy Montag brings to the reader a whole new life style that no one has ever experienced. I enjoyed reading this book because there was never a moment when I felt bored with what I was reading or thought of putting it down. I recommend this book to the young adult who is looking for an a relaxing, fun read."
6183,1,Love this book- so much to think about,A great read and very thought provoking. We read as part of a community grant - The Big Read. Would strongly recommend.
6186,1,This Powerful Warning for Our Future Is Powerful!,Bradbury creates a perfect dystopia in which life as we know it does not exist. The deep value of somewhat simple style makes this book one of the finest ever written. This book should be a necessity for anyone who plans on helping to preserve liberty for one's self and for all.
6189,1,Just reinstating what another has already said.,"I totally agree with ""Reader from Vermont"" Whoever you are, you summed up exactly how I felt about the book. I chose to read it because of all the hype. I was disappointed, I expected more. I feel that it is a good book, but overrated."
6195,1,Burn Baby Burn,"I have enjoyed reading this book. everyone will enjoy it after the first reading. It may be slighlty difficult in the beginning but if you continue to read you will find this book to be very deep, and compelling. I feel as if the more you read it, the more you will enjoy it because you will absorb more information that you may have missed on the first reading. Go Montag!"
6199,1,Excellent Read,"My daughter has to read this for her 10th grade english class and I decided to check it out myself. It is not as well written or as compelling as 1984 but it is still a very good read. The author makes a number of excellent points. To me it felt like film noir mixed up with some comic book qualities in my imagination. Still, a very good read with lessons to share."
6201,1,F. 451,"I really enjoyed this book, but the story line was a little different then I had expected it to be. This is always a fun book to read, which I will be reading in the future as well."
6217,1,Amazing book!,"I got this book to read as a part od the Nerdfighter summer book club, and I am so glad that I bought it. This book is amazing. It is incredible to think that this book was written over 50 years ago and Ray Bradbury pretty much predicted the decrease in book sales and increase in television viewers. This book is awesome and one of the best books I have ever read. It has completely changed the way that I read books and has increased my appreciation for the written word. I highly recommend this book to every single person who is able to read honestly."
6219,1,Great BUT hard to follow.,"This is amazing, all predictions and foreshadows came true in our present day lives. Amazing story a must read."
6223,1,Fahrenheit 451,"Fahrenheit 451 is a book about a man named Montag. His occupation is being a fireman. When this book takes place, which is in the future, the firemen are making fires for books instead of extinguishing fires. Montag meets a girl that's new to his neighborhood and he walks her home. On the way, he finds out that her name is Clarrise Mclellen. He also found out that she was quite peculiar. Clarisse asked questions like if he was happy."
6235,1,where has ramsey lewies been all my musical life?,"It's rare that I can find a piece of music that can relax me after a long week and get me grooving at the same time. This CD does it. It also gets my 1 year old son shaking his nappy so strong is the rhythm. Familiar songs given a piano jazz working maybe an ignoramus' view but that's what it is. I am amazed this trio weren't hawked to me as part of a back catalogue release sooner. But this proves there are some musical gems yet to be re-released in the noughties. Ramsay, your public needs you - where are you?"
6239,1,Good value,This product was delivered by provider on time and the quality is better the original I bought directly from my cell phone provider and way cheaper! The only down side is that the cord is short so it is difficult to talk on the phone while it's charging (unless you are hands free).
6241,1,Cood Customer Service!!,Ordered 2. One worked and the other didn't. Contacted Company who sent another at once. Got it i a few days and didn't have sent the broken one back. That saved me a lot of time. will do more orders with them in the future.
6242,1,Motorola car charger OEM?,"The car charger I ordered and got works great with my phone, but when I got it, it didn't look like the one the seller had pictured. He said it was on OEM. The one I received just had a small blue dot that lit up. The charger does look like it would be an OEM. I read from one seller that the one with the small blue dot was the newer model but I just checked the Motorola site and the one with the all blue glowing top is still the one they show. Reading a review by another buyer on another sellers site I found he had the same problem I did. So you may get the charger that is actually pictured and you may not depending on the seller. (Charger works great the reason for the 4stars and not 5stars is the charger did not look like the one pictured. If you really want what is pictured you may want to ask the seller if it is the one pictured, if you don't care what it looks like and just want one that works good then you can just order it)"
6244,1,"Glitches, Glitches and did I mention Glitches?","Well, the game is ok, as long as you don't want to finish it. Most of the game is just wandering around pointlessly to find things and getting lost a lot. The major problem is that at one point Gimli is invisible when you need to talk to him and the fact that every single game freezes up when you try to leave Moria. Other than that it's well.... ok for being Lord of the Rings merchandise."
6247,1,love the convenience,"I have the Plantronics BlueTooth for my cell phone, so when I was looking for a headset for my desk phone I knew that style and size worked for me. The fact that there are different sized ear buds is the key, since everyone's ear is shaped differently. My only complain about this headset is the fact that even though I have made the adjustments stated in the book, sometimes I get an echoing sound (only on my end) when I am talking. This does not always happen."
6251,1,Worth the Indulgence,The only reason this isn't a 5-star review is the hefty price. This briefcase is terrific and just the ticket for a baseball loving guy who traded in his glove (but not his love for the game) for a desk. It's heirloom quality and I may well come back in 20 years to give it a full five stars if it ages as well as I expect.
6252,1,Surprisingly complex,"I was happily surprised by this book. Given the snyopses, I expected the usual woman-as-victim-of-cruel-husband trope. Instead, the book presented a complex marriage, with both parties at fault; in fact, to me, the wife was in the wrong and was abusing her privileges for at least three quarters of the novel.The secondary and tertiary characters were well drawn, entertaining, and captivating. Trollope managed to convey myriad nuances of the male-female dynamic, avoiding stereotypes and common topicalities of many Victorian novels.Enjoyed this one a lot."
6254,1,Interesting View Into British Culture,As one would expect these producrions are beautifully presented. The quality of the acting is superb. England seems to produce character actors of great skill and presence. I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of themes presented
6258,1,Big band Cajun,"An interesting CD which gets better each time I listen..Being used to the basic home grown Cajun style of four or five people standing around an echoey room, the 'Big (ish) band' style of the CD came as a bit of a shock - initially somewhat disapointing.. But now, I love it!"
6263,1,Single in Saudi,It is interesting but these nurses are very naughty. Gives nurses a bad reputation. No wonder the countries in these regions look up us as immoral.
6268,1,Interesting obscure book.,"All I know of this book is that it has a lot of family history, and it is very hard to find. I've heard that it is available in limited viewing at Saint John The Baptist Catholic church in Johnsburg Illinois but couldn't find it. In any case if you can find it I'm sure it will cost an arm and a leg."
6274,1,"Good,but its not like his other movies","I went the store and i saw this movie on the counter and they had Van Damnes pic on it so i got it,i watched it,I wasnt pleased,i mean the movie was excellent,but where in the hell is Van Damnes high flying kicks,I am like a huge fan of Van Damne.This is like the only movie i didnt see him do his fancy kicks.This movie is worth watching,but if u wanna see his kicks dont get this one."
6277,1,"Not bad, actually","You don't watch Van Damme movies for the acting, realism or historical accuracy.With good reason.However, some predictable clichés and highly unlikely events aside, this film is pretty decent, has lots of action -which is what Van Damme does best - and is worth having if you're a Legion fan."
6281,1,Good tool to help with pulling,Definitely too big for my 10 pound yorkie. I was able to tighten it around her neck by sewing it and now it works great. It takes a while for the dog to get used to but makes such a difference when walking her!
6283,1,works,really work as they said it would instant control. nice walking a dog that doesn't pull you off your feet the moment you go out the door. longer walks more at ease
6303,1,"Very illuminating, enjoyable book","There aren't too many English-language histories of inter-war Poland, so this book is very welcome. It is easy to read and provides many interesting details on subjects (often regarded these days as obscure) such as inter-war Danzig and Poland's troubled relations with Lithuania and Cezchoslovakia. In many ways, it is popular history more than academic history: it has little to say on the inter-war economy and social structure of Poland. Its account of Polish diplomacy could be a little more rigorous, but the author, though clearly sympathetic to Poland, does not flinch awkward facts. One drawback is that the book hardly draws at all on modern research."
6307,1,Aijuswanalisen!!!,"Soulstar, Soulchild, whatever, just keep the Musiq COMING!!! Musiq is a talented, original artist. Not in an eclectic Erykah Badu kind of way, but more like a Curtis Mayfield. Shucks this CD is so good that the first time I listened to it in my car I stopped at the package store to get a pint of Hennessy.... It's old school brown liquor GOOD!!!! Like a good vintage wine, it keeps getting, better & better with each listen.... His creativity with the Monopoly game in ""Womanopoly"" is sick!! Fantasia can have her ""Baby Mama"" anthem, Musiq keeps it real with ""Babymother""! Aijuswanalisen!!!"
6311,1,Jusbeautiful,"At first I didn't really care for this album, but after a couple of listens, I love it. Neo-soul is here to stay and Musiq is the greatest. My favorite tracks are Womanopoly, Babymother, Who Knows, and so on. This cd is hot and I can't wait for the next one."
6326,1,The ESPN broadcast.,Great game... poor price for an ESPN broadcast. None the less a great championship game!
6330,1,Good Stuff,The item was exactly what I ordered and the person who received it as a gift loved it. I'm happy!
6333,1,"When you need orgainzation, this really helps","The Executive Job-Changing Workbook by John Lucht is a Companion to Rites of Passage. It has numerous forms that are very useful in organizing a job search. It is clear, easily usable, and helps one control the organization of a varied job search. It is very cleaverly designed to take apart so that you can take one section in a briefcase on interviews. This helps recording and tracking search letters, phone calls, interviews, and thank you letters. A great help in a time consuming process."
6335,1,Love the simpsons,"Good collection of episodes for the price. My family members are big Simpson fans, so we like collecting both the seasons and the specials. Funny, funny stuff."
6338,1,"Nice CD, but mislabelled","This CD is not Touch Sampler 5, which has not yet been released. This is Touch Sampler 00, released to commemorate the millenium. It's a nice CD, and the track listing is right, but the product title is incorrect. See [...]"
6342,1,Great little square for the price,"When I bought this square I considered it a disposable unit that would probably get bent broken or stolen within short order. After checking it against my Starrett and Mitutoyo squares I was surprised to find out that it was very accurate. Surprisingly, it is also pretty durable. While I am not a big fan of the zinc heads on most consumer grade squares, this one is well made, accurately machined and so far, durable. The etched and painted blade is easy to read although not as easy as the Starrett or Mitutoyo ""satin chrome"". Granted, you can buy 8 of these squares for the price of one of the Starrett or Mitutoyo units.While I would never consider replacing my 6"" Mitutoyo square with this one I will not hesitate to run out and buy another, or two or three Swanson squares when my current one finally does get bent or disappears.Overall, I would give this square five stars for value and four stars for quality."
6349,1,Fun but Ludicrous,"This is a great 'B' movie.There is no real comparison with the first one (1963).That one was an intellectual haunted house story. This one is just juvenile.The idea that the Dudleys,man and wife caretakers, could take care of a forty acre lawn as well as a monstrous castle by themselves struck me as hilarious.""No one from the town will come here"" she says.After the catastrophic damage in the house, I really felt for the Dudleys.The picture was just fun."
6351,1,Great Mystery - Not So Great Horror Flick,"If you like super-natural mysteries, then you'd like this film. It is technically a horror film, but it's really not that frightening (though there is a scene in the movie that made my mother jump about three feet), and as a result, is not for people that watch horror films for the fright. As a mystery, however, it is really quite good, and deserves to be watched over and over, just so you can find all the hidden clues for the answer at the end."
6357,1,Better than the original,"Don't form an opinion against it merely because Hollywood tells you that you shouldn't like it. At least in this remake, there's a believable reason for the house to be haunted instead of ""just because"" as it was with the original. This was scary when I first watched it and there was enough suspense without gore. Granted, it isn't as scary the second time around, but I've enjoyed it enough to watch it again and again."
6360,1,Ian Barnett,"I think that ""A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court"" was a entertaining and educational book. The book is about a boy named Michael who moves to Kentucky after his father dies. In Kentucky he is astounded to see so many fundamentalists, where in Philadelphia he had seen so many Catholics like himself. While living in Kentucky, Michael learns many things about the Fundamentalist Christians, as well as his own religion, Catholicism. His Uncle continually challenges Michael about his religion and tries to convert him to a Fundamentalist. This book was very interesting and worth the while. This was one of the best apologetics novels I've ever read."
6364,1,Stephen Dwyer,A PHILLY CATHOLIC IN KING JAMES COURT was an excellent book abou the catholic faith. It taught me that Mary was important and that the bread we eat at church is really Jesus. It also taught me how the amish culture in Kentucky was like. The part I didn't like though was that Michael learned the whole Catholic faith in just a couple of weeks. When it actually takes years of study to learn all those tihngs. Other than it was agood book and educational.
6365,1,Student in Mr. Puntel's Religion class,"I felt this book was very interesting and it gave me a lot more knowledge about Catholicism. Most kids Michael's age would not have shown such an interest for their religion, so it was a little hard to believe. For the most part it was a very good book and gave many important facts."
6366,1,Religion Review - LSCHS Student,"After reading A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court by Martin DePorres Kennedy, it got me to thinking more about the religion I practice, Catholicism. As the book starts out, Michael, having just tragically losing his father, is thrown into a world; it would seem he is not ready for. As he gets to know his Uncle Les's fundamentalist view of the bible, he begins to realize not everything they practice does follow the bible. He begins to see arguments arise and he himself is challenged on the ways of the bible. The most significant change seemed to be his debate with Pastor Brown. Though Michael had seemed cornered he slipped out of harms way once again. In my opinion, this book gives an excellent overview of the issues that people have disagreed on and also why there was a split within the church. Overall, the book may have seemed boring to some, but the depth of knowledge it provided made me get a deeper understanding of what we really practice at mass."
6370,1,"A colorful narrative, rich in detail.","This book is the definitive work on Columbus. Morison is famous for making the same journey that Columbus made with largely the same equipment in order to prepare for writing this book. His experience shines through in the detail thatMorison lavishes on his subject.As is the case with any great biography, Morison has become enamored with his subject, highlighting his strengths and successes while downplaying his weaknesses and failures, but you know that going into any biography and can adjust your interpretation accordingly.The story here is told very well, keeping the reader engaged and turning pages. Additionally, the book dispells many of the myths and common misconceptions about Columbus and really fills in a complete picure of the man.Well worth reading for any fan of history or biography."
6373,1,A Critical Introduction to the GB Theory,"Since Chomsky established the GB model in the early 1980's, many introductory books have been published. Culicover's book came out by the end of the GB fashion when most people were attracted by Chomsky's new ideas of the minimalist program (MP). However, this book is not out of date at all, since Culicover illustrated the GB theory in a very critical way providing with quite a number of problems which cannot be solved at ease within the GB framework. All those problems are interesting issues that generative syntax has to manage. Though the author gave some suggestions, the issues remained open both to the GB framework and the MP followers. After reading this book, you may realize that the GB model is not as good as most people believe and that the burden of the MP will be heavier when it has to take over what left insolvable in the GB."
6374,1,Good Book!,"This is a very good book! My sister and I used it to study for the ASVAB. Don't worry too much about the test, look over this book and relax during the test!"
6383,1,Worth the Cost,"I used to have an ATI TV PCI card, which is great for image captures, but gave me (and numerous other people I talked to) a headache for video capturing itself. The ADS USB Instant Video is a good deal for the price, and is excellent for good-quality video capturing (Excellent frame rate, just make sure other programs are off and the capturing isn't [messed] up at the start). Plenty of other excellent features, the software is a good-quality editing package. Compared to the ATI card though, capturing images is a bit annoying. Otherwise, it's worth it!Connections are very easy, and it's quite user-friendly and easy to learn, as I'm not a techie!"
6386,1,Wedding Tie,This tie was purchased for a family member's wedding. It is exactly what the bride requested and is exactly as described. The seller also included cleaning instructions and was packaged very nicely.
6389,1,Gyro is a great gift,I've purchased several of these as gifts for children I mentor in the public school system. I like them because they are educational and durable and hopefully are an item the child will keep for a long time.
6394,1,The final chapter of Jean de Florette,"Originally titled ""Manon des sources"", this movie is the conclusion to the store ""Jean de Florette"". It is done in French dialogue & English subtitles.The camera captures the beauty of the French countryside in all its splendour in this movie.Jeans' daughter Manon, has grown up and taken over the family farm, following the tragedy which occurs in the first installment.She seeks to extract revenge on those who have harmed her family.There are some amazing revelations in the movie, which will leave you shocked.A truly wonderful movie, well acted, directed and filmed.It is important to watch the first installment (JdF), before viewing this movie."
6396,1,A whimsical and humorous adventure with memorable characters,"I read this book as a child, and recently succeeded in finding it again (having forgotten the title.) Good Luck Arizona Man is the story of a white boy raised by Apaches, trying to discover the secrets of his own past and heritage while keeping his Apache identity. He goes on a search for the lost gold of the Apaches, which is tied up with his own mystery. Unfortunately, the mountains are filled with bizarre and dangerous white men also searching for the gold: and the Apache chief has sent men to ensure that the prophesy (he who finds the gold must die) comes trueThe book is humorous and whimsical, with many surprising plot twists. I doubt that the portrait of Apache life and customs is very accurate, but the white men are equally ridiculous. In any case, the characters (and their names--Head Toter, Tied-Up, Miss Utter Delight, Fantail and Poop, Old Wickiup, Missing Toe) are hilarious and unforgettable."
6401,1,Over a hundred pages of wonderful solitude,"I read this book in my freshman year of college. I loved it. It has many characters that flow together. The story has a magical realism to it. Characters die and come back to life, people live for years on end. It follows the lives of a family that deals with wars, tragic love, and mysterious dealings. I thorougly enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to enter a magical world filled with vibrant characters taking on all sorts of political and social issues to heart and then bending them as far as they can go. Think Dali."
6402,1,A timeless classic,"The One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of the most interesting novel I have ever read. First it starts with a married couple who are counsins, afraid that they will have a child with a pig tail, a myth about what happens when you marry close relations. This novel has the most confusing set of characters with the same name carried on from generation to generation. And this novel has some of the most interesting events that you will ever read. As you read this novel, you can actually see each charactrer falling into their life of solitude, one by one.This novel is very good, and I highly recommend it."
6406,1,Fantastical history of a common clan,"This surrealistic excursion, told matter of factly in a style reminiscient of James Joyce, traces the life of several generations of the Buendia family, ordinary folks living ordinary lives in a small Colombian town who accidentally become witnesses to such monumental events as civil war, plagues, social oppresion while cherishing passionate encounters and obsessive fixations on obscure activities. Only in the final pages does it become clear that all which has transpired over the generations was foretold as the rise and fall of the Buendia family by the mystical gypsy Maquiliades. I suspect this literary masterpiece is more impressive in its original Spanish version, but its constant surprises and matter of fact style compel the reader's attention."
6418,1,First Pratchett I've read and I'm very impressed.,"A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk. Discworld is at once absurd and complex, yet held against the fabric of our reality, it's just as plausible. I'm hard pressed to think of a more likable character than Corporal Carrot. The modest anti-gun message was subtle enough to remain unobtrusive."
6421,1,Funny!,"This movie is about a kid who thinks he is moving to Chicago from ?So he decides to back at bullies,teachers,etc. Then it turns out he isn't moving!& that's all I can tell!Buy It!"
6422,1,THE USUAL SUSPECTS,"MY KIDS AND I LOVED THE MOVIE. IT'S YOUR USUAL KID OVERCOMING HIS FEARS AND BEATING THE BULLY STORY, BUT IT IS FUNNY. I THINK I MAY HAVE ENJOYED MORE THAN MY KIDS."
6425,1,Almost perfect,"I read this book as part of an MBA module. I didnt know anything about Activity Based Costing at the time and so the book was a little difficult since it was not meant to be an introduction to the subject. After I did some research and became more familiar with the material, I realised how great this book is. I have read it twice. The book is well structured and the authors use plenty of real life case studies. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is that I would have rather seen a large section at the end of the book with more detailed information about the case studies. I read some Harvard case studies that were mentioned in the text and it was really helpful because they put things in perspective. I think the authors should have included two or three case studies with their analysis at the end of the book. Other than that, I dont think that there is a better book about the subject out there."
6430,1,Nice introduction to the world of Chaucer,"Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales are nothing short of genius and one of the few glimpses we have into 14th century life today. Romance, Comedy, Adventure and Fantasy - there should be something here to amuse everyone.If you're a little to intimidated by the original Middle-English version then this is the book for you. My suggestion is to read this version first, then get a copy in the original Middle-English and read that."
6431,1,He writes with ink and parchment...,"I bought this book after reading the Pardoner's tale in my High School English class. It's wonderful, and the translation is great, not to mention that Chaucer is one of the best writers of all time. I think that I may slightly prefer Shakespeare, but not by much.. and many of the tales have things in them that I didn't think people even would dare talk about hundreds of years ago.. that was really cool. I will definitely read this book again, when I'm in the mood for it. ^_^"
6433,1,A good translation.,"The Canterbury Tales is my very favorite book. I personally enjoy the original Middle English version and would highly suggest it to all who are interested in it. (I purchased a 1929 copy of Everyman's Library Series The Canterbury Tales from my favorite used bookstore.) Though I have read my Everyman's Library version so many times I can repeat many sections word for word, I also own Nevill Coghill's translation and it is delightful. It is one of the best translations of the book which I have read. I, of course, would suggest reading it in Middle English, but if you are frusturated or confused by the language then I would recommend this translation. It sticks closely to the feeling that you get from Chaucer's original text. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the Middle English version will always hold the number one spot in my heart."
6436,1,Chaucer appeals to everyone,"The Canterbury Tales is so appealing due to it's diverseness. Chaucer was involved with every level of society during his time. This is shown with how the characters are so well-rounded. The short, but insightful description of the travelers is also helpful in picturing this group riding on thier way to the shrine of Becket. A great book everyone should read, but one of those you have to be in the mood for. Also don't expect a continuing theme or story, but short stories that sometimes leaves you hanging."
6438,1,Classic,"In order to understand English litterature and the English language, many have read, or at least tried to read, Chaucers ""Canterbury Tales"". I too did begin (and sort of finished) the work in Middle English, which is not as hard as one might be lead to think, but is quite labourious and painstakingly slow at times. With this version, a great compromise has been found, translating it as true to the original as possible yet in modern English. I know that every time you make a rewrite or translation, things are lost, but sometimes it is necessary, or just quite convenient. This is one of those times.It is great fun reading the Canterbury Tales. The structure of the work makes it very accesible and easy to pick up after some time away. You could treat it as a whole entity or as a collection of short stories centered around a group of persons on a pilgrimage. One of the books that any decent home library shouldn't be without."
6439,1,Very emotional...,"Dear readers, This book was definitly worth reading. Not only does it give information about the finding of the "" Unsinkable Ship "", there is also a story going on at the same time about her fateful night. I have to tell you though, it's heart-wrenching and emotional at times. Some of the information it gives is about the machines used to find the TITANIC, and stuff like that. That was a little hard to understand for me, and it probably would also for young children. I hope you enjoy this book, as you go back to the TITANIC."
6441,1,Piper is NOT Ugly!,"Coyote Ugly is a sexy ""feel good"" movie. We get a nice introduction to Piper Perabu, who may well be the next Alicia Silverstone or Cameron Diaz. It is basically a story of a naive girl from New Jersey who comes to New York to persue her dream as a singer/songwriter.When she realizes that she isn't going to be an instant success, she takes a job in club with the title name. Her dancing skills improve and her fear of perfoming in front of crowds starts to diminish. She incidentally meets a nice young man whom she starts seeing, and though there are troubles, her move to the top is going strong by the end of the movie.The plot is very predictable, but the acting is well above average. It was nice to see of movie of this genre with relatively little foul language. I don't believe the ""F"" word was used at all. All in all, a nice and enjoyable movie that is suitable for most members of the family. I recommend it."
6446,1,"A cute, entertaining movie.","I'm pretty sure for all of us guys whose seen the trailer for the first time thought this movie was targeted for the male audience. But guess what, producer Jerry Bruckheimer fooled us! It's a... chick flick! But it's a... good chick flick! Not only is Piper Perabo's character is infectiously loveable, but the other Coyotes are hot and sexy as well. The plot isn't extra-ordinary, but it's fun to watch with the help of the great soundtrack and funny moments. The DVD features a behind-the-scenes look at the movie, cool graphics, and a music video with LeAnn Rimes."
6448,1,Really Good Movie!,I saw this movie because I`m a Leann Rimes fan and she`s in it.I was pretty impresed with this movie and I highly reccomend it to anyone almost!Definately a must-see!
6449,1,Great Movie,"I love this movie,i watched it the first time with my best friend and then realized that i had to have a copy of it because its such a great movie"
6454,1,Garbage blends rock and pop into a winning combination,"Shirley Manson's melodious voice flows through each track of Version 2.0 flawlessy and beautiful, backed up by Butch Vig's stellar percussion, and Duke Erikson and Steve Marker's guitar. Taking in each song of Garbage is a joy. Some might be over-syntesized but if you break that barrier you can see and feel the genius that is Garbage. You journey from the Euro-dance style of ""Hammering in my head"" to the genuine rock-pop sound of ""I think I'm paranoid"". Garbage Version 2.0 aims to please."
6458,1,Don't forget to take out this Garbage!,"I was unsure as to how Garbage planned to mutate their music to produce a whole new CD. I loved the first album, but feared the upcoming release would simply be more of the same. Fortunately, it was! I am not sure how to explain how Butch Vig and Co. manage to keep me interested from song to song other than pure magic."
6461,1,Ahem. Please allow me to change my mind.,"Rather than skipping this CD and buying only ""Strauss Dances,"" as I recommended in June, buy both and copy them onto two sides of a 90-minute audio cassette.Rolfe Kent's soundtrack holds up very well over time -- except for the last number, a vocal not heard in the movie. Rearrange and re-engineer the songs as you like them. I put ""Tivoli-Rutsch Walzer"" on the tape where it should have been.You might also find Django Rhinehart's ""Honeysuckle Rose,"" which worked so well in the movie, and insert that where it should be. Lose the ""Back Where You Belong"" vocal and let Sting sing last.On the other side, let the Gaudier Ensemble serenade you with ""Tivoli"" and whatever other dances you like. Voila, the perfect tape."
6463,1,Understanding Six Plays,"In Understanding August Wilson Professor Bogumil covers six of his plays: Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Fences, Joe Turner's Come and Gone, The Piano Lesson, Two Trains Running, and Seven Guitars. The book opens with a chapter on August Wilson as an African American playwrite that talks about his life as well as what sets his plays apart from thos of other African American playwrites. Professor Bogumil ties in Wilson's plays to societal facotrs, and has crafted a very fine and scholarly work that makes August Wilson's writing more approachable and understandable to anyone from students to casual readers."
6464,1,Nice Map Book,"This map book has kept me on track several times. I have a garmin GPS as well but sometimes I like to know where I am going before I leave or see if the GPS has picked the way I want to go. The maps also work by them self, once I lent my GPS to a friend and I had to navagate on my own using the the maps to get to a new place, and it worked! I like the binding too, very durable and handy."
6468,1,Good Book,Good book although some aspects are very general. See also Surviving Financial Disasters By Tiffany R. Love it comes with a CD ROM.
6490,1,The Shipping News,"I enjoyed the movie so much and loved the sound track, which I have really enjoyed and would recommend it to everyone who enjoys music with a Celtic sound."
6491,1,Great Tomcat overview,"Just recently finished reading and studying the content of the book Apache Jakarta-Tomcat by James Goodwill. I have used Tomcat as a basic JSP engine for sometime now, but admittedly knew only the basics. Godwill in his book goes through how to setup the Tomcat server, as well as various different utilities and advanced configuration.As a result of reading this book, I now know how to use the Tomcat Manager, configure the tomcat security realms, and integrating Tomcat with Apache. In addition, was learned alot through the examples on struts and SOAP.All in all this book is great for someone looking to broaden their understanding of Tomcat."
6495,1,"Great ,but...","the nudity could have been left out! It have had the exact impact without. Redgrave was absolutely wonderful! Although I did not agreee with Ian McKellan's Oscar nod, his performance was mediocre compared to Jim Carrey's delightful performance in The Truman Show! The discrete nudity was the only downfall of this well made and written film."
6507,1,The comedy fighter anime,"I must admit I bought this anime for my girlfriend, she is just getting into anime and picked it out at random, so it was a very random not really thought about purchase. But I am still plesantly surprised by this purchase. Funny and action work well together in this anime. All the people in the anime are ones you want to learn about. Especially Kenichi himself. Can't wait to check out the rest of the show and hopefully if it ends well I'll be picking up the next season."
6509,1,1st Impression,"This was the first time I ever bought something off the store online, I wasn't expecting it to come in on time, much or less receive it cause of all the scandaling now a days. Very impressed and can't wait to buy more online"
6515,1,"A warning, however, regarding IPods","I bought this to use with an Apple IPod. It is a great card and works well for the most part, but it does NOT work with my IPod. Even though it is recommended by Apple (...), it can't supply (enough?) power and the IPod's battery drains in seconds."
6516,1,nice,Its great information made me just want to read more it showed me how i can achieve things on mind and spirit in this religion amazing!
6522,1,Tales of British wartime Derring-Do!,"It IS a true tale and a lot of the detail is correct - till about half way through when an ""Irish spy"" arrives in the UK on behalf of the Germans. Not needed in the real world story - the twist is needed to add some tension at the end of the film.Clifton Webb acts like Clifton Webb - that is to say like a plank of wood! However for the period it is well done.Spot the pennant number on a Castle Class frigate in the background of one scene and then go and watch ""The Cruel Sea"". Guess the Admiralty ""lent"" the British cinema the same ship in more than one movie!Topical (early 2008) because as of late the identiy of the ""body"" used in the real war has become subject of fresh debate."
6532,1,Bonsai Pruner,"Nice and simple to use, especially for a beginner who is not looking to spend a fortune on the basics.Rust a little to quick if left out side (mostly my fault) but is easy enough to clean. They are sharp and do the job and I got 2 for my money. The also have a traditional Japanese look to them which I like!"
6536,1,nice,it's a nice bra for support. i like it because it's full coverage. it's pretty much the same as my other victoria secret bras. but i paid less. :)
6541,1,Good CD,"As a historic re-enactor, I'm always looking for good music. I also liked the 1 click purchase feature and downloads.You don't get liner notes. This is something Amazon should work on!I would recommend this to folks who enjoy the period."
6556,1,Acquaintance Brings History to life !,"I recently had to read An Aqaintance ith darkness for a book report. When i was assigned the book i was not happy to have to read a boring cival war book. An Aquaintance must have been anything but boring. Emily Bransby Pigbush, a 14 year old girl lives in Washington D.C. until her mother dies. she is then sent to live with her Rich Uncle instead of her best friend. It turn out her Uncle who is a Doctor, gets people to body snatch people straight from the grave. The whole thing turns out all right. this is a great book to read if you are a fan of cival war hitory. I enjoyed every moment!"
6565,1,Handy,Although handy the box could have a better way to hold in place all the useful screws. Overall it is great purchase.
6566,1,Not bad,"Kit has a lot if parts. Some are great for certain glasses, others are too small. Would be great if half the kit was full of larger screws."
6568,1,Comprehensive guide to ski touring in the Tahoe ares.,"My copy of this book is nearly destroyed from all the use it receives. This book is not just for winter. Many of the tours described have also turned out to be excellent mountain bike routes and hiking trips. The descriptions of the areas the routes traverse could be expanded, but the route information itself is first class."
6573,1,Great card but win7 users be wary,"I recently purchased this card for a new build. The card worked great at first with the MSI drivers but a few days afterwards I kept getting horrible connection issues. I'd stay connected but webpages would take forever to load and when in WoW I would get lag (people running in place) and disconnects. After reading reviews I tried ralink drivers RT61. These drivers worked great with connectivity but then, every once in a while, caused me to lose total connection followed by a BSOD (blue screen). After dealing with the BSODs I found out that this card runs off the Ralink RT2561 chip, went to Ralink's site and used their updated drivers...everything works fine now.summary:1) use Ralink RT2561 drivers.2) enjoy"
6584,1,Decent entry level receiver,"I've had this receiver for a couple of years, I guess.It still works flawlessly, as did it's Pioneer predecessorbefore it developed a hum in one channel.It has plenty of inputs and outputs. I'm happy that ithas digital audio (fiber optic) input as the only soundoutput my brand new LG TV has is a digital audio.The remote can be a bit fiddly and, like many otherproducts produced abroad, has a less than understandableuser manual. I waded my way through it, and my systemsounds good, but understanding all of the features byreading about them in the manual is difficult.I would certainly consider replacing this receiverwith another Pioneer product. I've used them for yearswith few problems."
6585,1,DONT BUY FROM AMAZON!!!,this is a good reciver but i got it at circuit city for 120. i live in california so im not sure if they have circuit city's anywhere else.
6588,1,Good transition book,"As an experienced C/C++ programmer, I wanted a book that could fairly quickly get me up speed in Java. I'd say that this book met that challenge. Though it's 700+ pages may seem a bit daunting at first, it was an easy read for myself.To finish my first Java project, I had to rely on on-line help and a few other books, so don't expect this to be the only Java book you read. But as a start for an experienced programmer it's quite adequate."
6593,1,Better,I read an bridged copy of this book when I was just a boy. It was a good book then. I decieded that I would reread this book. I was surpised that not much was taken out. It was still a good book. I am looking into getting more Holmes' books.
6595,1,chris's review,"this was one of shelocks best books. this book was suspenceful,exicting, mysterious and shocking. in this book all kind of things happen,i mean think about it ok, your in 1814 and your dad has been atacked by a ""hell hound"" so you think his son has just enherited his mancion and his money. she he calls sherlock holmes to find out what happend to his father, and as he gets to start looking around the place he finds that the father had another son but did not knew about it. this son was even living on the property, and this son was the killer becuse he whanted to have the manchion. the conflict is great, we have person vs.person, person vs.nature, person vs.animal. this was a great book just to read, allways had surprises and suspence, it was a great mystery.it was a great thing to see that the hound was only a starved animal."
6599,1,Hound of the Baskervilles,This book was used as an example of English literature of the period in an English Literature class for 8th graders which I teach. All of the young readers enjoyed the book and I am very pleased with the quality of the item and the children's responses to it.
6614,1,Bighorse the Warrior,"If you have an hour to two hours, and have any interest in Native American History from an Indian perspective, Tiana's story of Bighorse is a gem to find! Short, but sweet, this biography was told out of love, but also told because the the Indian's perspective of American History is often muted and/or erased. This book definitely keeps their spirit alive!"
6654,1,Psychological thriller!,This movie really scared me when it came out in theaters years ago. It is still pretty exciting and leaves you wondering if the guy is really crazy or his dummy is alive!
6655,1,"great lil printer, BUT","I bought this to replace my original HP 4L Laser jet after 15 years. This seems to do a great job so far, much faster downloads and clean print,BUT BEWARE.... IT DOES NOT COME WITH A USB CORD TO CONNECT, so if the printer your replacing has the old stle connecter (as mine did) be ready to spend another $35.00 for a usb cord. That is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars."
6669,1,I went to school with the author,"Camika was always serious at ETSU, so to see her actually write a book with humor almost sent me to my grave. I enjoyed the book and it's good to finally see the author relax and live a little. I never thought she'd be an author either. All she ever did that made her smile was play Spades. The book was all that and I'm really just glad to know that I know someone who is taking the bull by the horns and following her dream. Hey Camika, remember that water gun fight with the Omegas and the time we kidnapped the guy we thought was on line for Alpha? Those were the days. I'm a supporter for life! Oo-oop!"
6696,1,Excellant Christian Music With A Classic Style,"Loved the song ""Teach me to wait"", sung as duet with a beat that makes you want to start singing along. The other songs are also very enjoyable with a classic gospel style that was refreshing but not ""old timey"" enough to feel dated. I especially enjoyed his versions of ""Praise the Lord"" and ""This Day"". I bought this album to get the song ""Teach me to Wait "" which I had heard on a Christian radio called Songtime but I was also very satisfied with the album as a whole."
6704,1,You can get it cheaper,"I purchased this card because the unique capabilities of our network required it. So I can't speak for it's features...But I only paid $25.00 for it. If you shop for this item on on-line auctions, you can get a very good deal."
6709,1,Nice but not hot enough,This product looks nice and is easy to operate but it doesn't keep coffee hot enough. I'm not one of those people who likes their coffee scalding hot either. It definitely does the trick but that's my only beef with it. It might work better with a closed-top mug.
6710,1,It works ok.,"This warmer will do exactly that - keep coffee ""warm"", but definitely not hot. I guess if it kept coffee hot they would have called it a coffee ""heater""... It's just ok. Keeps coffee from going luke-warm or cold."
6721,1,Effectiveness depends on the cup,"This pad does get pretty hot, but how well it keeps your beverage hot really depends on the cup that you use. The problem is that most (all?) mugs have a circular bottom, so the actual surface area that contacts the pad is pretty small. That being said, my drink never really got colder than a step hotter than lukewarm, so I guess it works fine!Safety is somewhat of a concern, though. It uses a simple on/off switch, and I'm not sure what will happen if it is left on for days at a time. I think a system where it is only on when a cup is on it would be awesome.Your cup also sits about an inch higher off the table, so risk of knocking it over is a bit higher.Overall, a good and cheap solution to the everyday first world problem of keeping a hot drink hot."
6725,1,Love it!,I was worried that I would buy this product and it wouldn't work because of the price. The Mr. Coffe mug warmer works and is worth the money.
6729,1,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer,"Bought three for home & offices. Large heating surface keeps hot coffee hot and warms cooled coffee eventually. Wipe the warming surface after spills; it will last much longer.Wish the ""on"" light was bigger & brighter as reminder to turn off."
6730,1,Fine product,"This coffee warmer works great. It works better if the cup has a lid, I use a box of guitar stings to cover the mug. My only problem is that I forget to put my coffee cup on it when I am busy reading, etc. I blacked out the white Mr Coffee logo on mine so it remains entirely black except the orange light."
6742,1,If you don't love the Scots...,"Being a fan of Peter Mullan, I wanted to see this -- I think his first directing effort. It's hard to take, more than a little over the top -- but in the end, it is incredibly moving and a remarkable work."
6743,1,Modern Entry in Fantasy Romance,"With a heavy helping of humor, Jennifer Crusie treats the reader to a fun and witty escapist romance. No, it's probably never going to happen this way, but it's fun, it's charming, and the dogs will warm your hearts too. The Lucy character manages to be smart, cute, sassy and independent, which is a big improvement over some of the lame ladies in romantic fiction. Zach, as the macho policeman, is a bit much but able to be taught. Crusie also allows the reader a certain amount of imagination when it comes to the lustier moments. This book might just be the answer for a cold winter evening."
6744,1,Getting rid of Bradley,I enjoyed the book once I got over the readers voice. The book was exciting and fun to listen to i alway enjoy Jennifer cruise books.
6745,1,Nice..,"It was a very cute story but I personally prefer ANYONE BUT YOU over this story. The character Zack in this story is a bit rough around the edges for me. Although at the end he did soften up a lot, but I felt his character was very rough. However it was a nice, humorous story, and it does keep the reader interested through out the plot."
6759,1,Good depiction of WW1 air war,"For the war buff only. Outstanding flying scenes, even if some of the aircraft types are wrong. John Phillip Law is good as Von Richtofen, though too tall. The Baron was a small man. Don Stroud portrays Roy Brown as sort of a cowboy. Brown was an officer and a gentleman. American actors don't play Canadians well. If you like the flying, I highly recommend Howard Hughes' film 'Hell's Angels' (1930). As real as it gets!"
6764,1,"Outstanding movie, lackluster dvd edition","Moonstruck is a movie that easily deserves five stars. However, this DVD edition of Moonstruck has been edited to a full-screen format from the original widescreen. As far as I'm concerned, when publishers edit a film in that manner, they in effect are butchering the film-makers' original vision. One grossly butchered scene involves Cher and Aielo (sp?) together in the front seat of a car: the viewer is allowed to see only one actor at any one time, because the full-screen format will only fit one actor onscreen at once. This causes the audience to miss exactly one-half of each actor's wonderful performance. What a shame.To my knowledge there is no widescreen version of this outstanding movie available on DVD. That's just too bad."
6770,1,LOVE THEM FOR DAYTIME!,"Pampers will always be my favorite diapers and frankly you get more in the ""Baby Dry"" than the more tailored pampers that have more gel. My baby doesn't break out with ""Baby Dry"" like they do with the more tailored ones. The only thing I don't like is they don't hold enough wetness at night. But when you have a baby that pees a gallon, I guess you'll have this. ;)"
6771,1,Pampers,"I used Pampers swaddlers when my baby was first born and LOVED them!!! It's silly, but since he's outgrown swaddlers and I've started buying less expensive diapers, I've missed the powdery clean smell of Pampers in his room, I also figured they would be a lot better than Huggies because of the price, so I was excited to find a good deal on these Pampers. Turns out they're just fine--they are softer than Huggies, but when they get wet they feel like they are full of gel, kinda weird. I don't think they are worth paying more to get, but I didn't have any problems with them. Oh, and my baby is around 20-21 pounds, and when I am done with this pack, I think I'll move to size 4. He's only 10 months (so a little chubby), and the diapers are getting a little small around his waist. Plus, if he sleeps for a long time, he challenges the capacity."
6773,1,Very happy with purchase.,I am so pleased with Amazon Mom especially with buying diapers. The Pampers economy pack gives plenty of diapers to last me until my next delivery. I love the price.
6780,1,Great diaper but not a size two,"I love the Pampers Baby Dry diapers. My daughter has never had any leaks or diaper rash using them. I bought the economy pack thinking they'd last a while. But at three months old and 11 1/2 pounds, I'm finding that the straps barely fit and that the leg holes are digging into her skin. I'm going to have to give them to my sister-in-law's newborn so they won't go to waste."
6782,1,Not too Shabby,"Pamper diapers are pretty good. They do not hold up as well as huggies as far as leaking goes, but for the price on Amazon its worth it!!"
6798,1,best for the $$$,"these do a very, very good job. huggies supreme hold a bit more liquid but for the price the best you can get. actually like better than the pampers cruisers and they cost less. with the amount in the box - one case is good for almost a month. rarely leak - even w/ a 2 year old at night."
6800,1,fits our baby the best,"as every new parent out there we were completely confused with the whole diaper situation: what brand is better, what are the differences, what size fits, is chlorine-free option important, etc. we've tried/tested almost every brand available on the east coast, including some store brands. Pampers came out on top, hands down.- the absorbency is great. other brands remain wet inside causing diaper rash.- the elastics are snug, but not tight. we didn't have any accidents with leaking. not counting one, when we overtightened the diaper by accident.- the cut and nice and generous. fits chubby legs well.- the material is soft. doesn't feel like you are putting sanding paper on your baby.one complain: very strong powdery smell. but we got used to it."
6812,1,Impossible to use just one.,"These are fine wipes, nice thickness and scent. But it is seriously irritating that you can't ever pull out just 1 with one hand. I guess they overlap too much. It reminds me of the magic trick with endless scarves tied together that just keep coming out of the top hat. We're constantly shoving them back in the dispenser. This won't keep me from buying again, but it is one of those quietly irritating things you deal with every day."
6817,1,Have the diapers changed?,"I was using Huggies Little Movers for awhile until they were out of stock of my daughters size so I decided to use Baby Dry. I've used them before and I don't remember them being this cheaply made and flimsy. Honestly, if I had my eyes closed and touched them, I would have mistaken them for Luvs. Not that there is anything wrong with Luvs because the price is so cheap, but I expect the quality to be better for Baby Dry diapers."
6823,1,smells good,Wipes smells good. They come out of the dispensor great. They are a little on the thin side. I would buy again.
6827,1,baby diapers,"I tried Cruisers and Pampers and Huggies. Huggies Supreme leaked. The only two that did the job were Cruisers and Paprer Baby Dry Diapers. Unfortunatelly Cruisers overpriced although they fit the best. Baby Drys does the job with a more appropriate price tag, but their fit is poorly designed"
6828,1,Best diapers we've used so far,"No diaper is perfect, that's why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. These are however the best we've used so far (and we've used quite a lot of different brands and types). Fewer blow-outs and seems to hold a lot of pee overnight. Thumbs up :)"
6834,1,A Marked Reduction in Leaks,"Another reviewer mentioned that Pampers are the best for long, skinny babies. That's what I have, and I can vouch for these being much better than the Huggies that the hospital sent home with us. My son managed to pee out of those without hardly touching the diaper. I have no idea how he did it. These diapers were much better, although they weren't totally blow-out-proof. Now that he has grown out of the Newborn size and into size 1, I am still using the Pampers Baby Dry, and I think they do the job just fine, although if there is a diaper that is 100% leak-proof, I would love to know what it is."
6835,1,slow shipping,"I've always loved pampers and this was such a great deal so I jumped on it. Everything came and all was good, but it took 2 weeks for the shipment to get to my home. In that time I had to buy another pack of diapers. All of my other amazon shipments usually only take a few days, maybe a week. I just do.t understand why this one took so long. Besides that things were fantastic."
6836,1,Good diapers with occasional leaks,I was using Pampers Swaddlers when my daughter was a newborn. I found that the baby dry diapers were cheaper than Swaddlers and decided to give them a try. They are not very soft like Swaddlers and are without the indicator strip but they are good and they leak occasionally when she wears them overnight. My daughter is 19 months old now. The shipping is amazingly fast and so I keep ordering them again and again. The price is less when compared to other shopping sites and in stores and it even goes down when Amazon have an e-coupon.
6839,1,great diapers,"Switched to these after Pampers downgraded their Cruisers. They work very well for us, not to mention they are more affordable than Cruisers too."
6846,1,Good diapers for a decent price,"I found that these baby dry diapers hold up well during the night for my son. They are not as soft as pampers cruiers, but work great. I found amazon to be the best price around, (are they were shipped right to our door!)"
6853,1,"delivered diapers..come on, a win/win","This is the biggest box of diapers that I can find in my area and it's tough for me to get to the store so having these delivered to my door is amazing. They do ship directly in the box, as is, in the picture. So if you live in a condo/apt/etc. and need privacy with your packages or are concerned that someone might take them, maybe not a good idea?"
6855,1,great diaper for the price,I have been using these diapers on my 6 week old son for a couple of weeks now an havent had any issues with them like some people say they have. They are thinner then the swaddler dry max but I think these do there job great. I have not had any leaks with these at all. But my son is a sleepy baby and just got out of the NICU so I change his diaper every 3 hours to help wake him up. I do prefer the swaddlers dry max as I think they are a nicer and thicker diaper but if your looking for value for money these are fine.
6871,1,Shoo Goo,"My son, who is a skater, needed something to repair his favorite skate shoes, duct tape just didn't look good! He saw a video recommending Shoo Goo, it sounded like just the thing we needed to fix his shoes, so we tried it. It worked great, but I wish that I had chosen the clear, as I chose black and the result was less than I expected. I will definitely buy this product again, but I will choose clear instead of black!"
6875,1,I Loved the Story if nothing else,"I thought that honoring Audrey Hepburn was a wonderful idea and ever since I found out about the special, I had wanted to see it. Although, in the beginning, I did not particularly like Hewitt's interpretation of Audrey, after I watched it a few more times, her performance grew on me. I now find myself watching the tape weekend after weekend, hanging on her every word, waiting to see what happens next.(even though I have it memorized.) The story is amazing with all the different love struggles that she goes through. My favorite moments are all her proposals and break ups. I think that anyone who likes a good Romantic flick would love this movie. It is definately worth the watching."
6900,1,"Great Dress, Even better price","I along with 3 other bridesmaids purchased this dress last summer for my best friends wedding. It looked great on different body types and you can't beat the price. We ALL went a SIZE UP in the dresses. Which is different than some reviewers said. I thought the measurements were accurate but their related size was too big ie. a small should really be called an extra small etc. Even still, I love these dresses so much I think I am going to use them (in different colors of course) for my own wedding!"
6912,1,good mallets for toddlers to play with,"I bought these mallets as toys for my toddlers to bang on their drum set. I reduced one star because the plastic round part of the mallet may pop off and could be a choking hazard. It can easily be fixed and I really think they're okay to give the kids as long as your watching them (or your kids have matured enough to know not to put the plastic in their mouths). Given that toddlers have a knack for breaking things and/or losing things, I think these were worth buying."
6916,1,Have you ever seen moves like this?,"As a young man watching this movie, it instilled in me a since of pride and dignity knowing the challenges of that era did not stop the greatness that is now forever preserved on dvd. I'd have to agree with the great Gregory Hines who was known for this statment: ""The best tap dance number on film...the Nicholas Brothers and the big white staircase"". These brothers stole the show for me. Get it for your library."
6922,1,Sad but true,"George C. Scott reprises his role as Patton in the 2nd part of the movie ""Patton"" It picks up where the movie left off, with the end of WWII to the tragic car accident that left Patton paralyzed. Eva Marie Saint climbs aboard as Mrs. Patton. Beautifully done!"
6928,1,Either Amazon or Windsor messed up. Only received 1!,"I received only 1 canvas, even though it says it's a pack of 6. The 1 canvas I did get was great and I already painted on it. I had to chat w/ customer service and they advised they would resend me the order 1 day shipping, but then I looked at the delivery estimate and I won't get it until 9/18/12- 10/5/12, which is pointless. I just read all the other reviews and this seems to be a common occurrence."
6933,1,"Interesting, sometimes thought provoking","This disc consists of four different stories. While only two of them really deal with robots and are the thought provoking stories, the other two are quite watchable. They're all well written and performed. It's a short disc, so you don't get a lot of bang for your buck, but it's worth seeing if you're interested in the social aspects of artificial life."
6942,1,Good!,I would have wanted to know before buying it that the silicon was hard and is not as soft as I thought. However it is a good protector for the phone.
6948,1,Crazy About Alabama in Arizona,"Crazy In Alabama is engrossing and entertaining with the excellent re-creation of the mid-60's with respect to cars, fashions, and the civil rights movement.All actors were superbly cast for their roles. Not bad directing Mr. Banderas; You may have another artistic venue or outlet, yet. There are two stories simultaneously being told here. Yes, they are both effective and do meet at the end of the road for purpose and not filler. The title itself is also double edged meaning ; It is indicative of the racial tension and madness in Alabama happening while Lucille is on her cross country/Hollywood quest (to lay certain ghosts of the past to rest as well)..."
6950,1,Great Silk Pants Except:,"Great Silk Pants Except My Husband wears a Size Large Pants in everything and with these pants I wish i would of ordered an Extra Large, they are a little short on him (Looks like he's waiting for a flood).I ordered the Burgandy and Blue and the colors are so Deep and Rich.Very Nice. They wash nice also."
6951,1,Over all quite pleased,"I have two other Sony VCRs...but except for two short comings are no better. These two failing occur in the pause and slow modes in which there is too much video noise. All other features work quite well, with the flash rewind a dream. The remote also deserves high marks for its ease of use.Best of all is the picture quality which ranges from very good to excellent... I'd rate it a best buy."
6956,1,No surprises,This order arrived timely and was exactly what was advertised... now I just need to dedicate time to going through the program.
6958,1,Nice to have in your collection..,"Just like the other Final Fantasy Music Collections, this CD is a ""must-have"" one (although it's not the best of Uematsu). Since the theme for Final Fantasy VIII is ""love"", this CD gives you the sense of sweet, loving and relaxing. The first track is ""Blue Fields"" and followed by a super hit, ""Eyes on me"", track which is a newly rearranged one (But still very good). The rest of the CD gives you the same sensation. I find this CD is good for my relaxing day and before bed time and everytime I listen to it, I just like it more and more. As I said, if you like final fantasy series and Uematsu's work, you will like this CD."
6963,1,SEEMS TO WORKING GREAT,"Not greasy and i feel like I can see a difference already after less than a month. Will buy again,"
6990,1,Nice.,"This book surprised me. For being one of Gardner's first books, its a great one. He tosses around tons of different concepts and ideas with ease. He paints a vivid picture of of a universe in which ""The Technocracy"" regulates lifeform's behavior by eliminating all of the non-sentients. This in it's self makes for some pretty interesting rules. In this story, the main characters must not only deal with these rules, but also bend them. And the way that happens mixes a recipe that isn't your typical sci-fi fare.Very interesting stuff."
6992,1,Excellent Compilation,"This compilation of early (31-34) Calloway features excellent sound quality and a first-rate band backing up the King of Jive. At a great bargain price, this set is recommended for those who like their 30s swing served hot."
6993,1,deja vu,I don't have anything to add to the other five-star reviews apart from this: I too received this book in 1979 or 80. I recently dug it out and gave it to my six year old son and he LOVES it. Evidently the passage of time and the advent of video games and digital animation has not dimmed this title's appeal.
6995,1,Nice maps but literally just covers the Gulf coast,"The maps are great as expected from Michelin, but note that this book covers the Gulf Coast only. No complete state is mapped. The Atlantic coast of Florida is not mapped. It covers from Brownsville, TX to Miami, FL but only for about a hundred miles inshore."
6996,1,Good,"The book was shipped very well and not damaged from shipping. But, I have to say there was damage from many sharpie marks scrawled on the bottom of the book."
7001,1,I'D BUY IT AGAIN,LOTS OF GREAT FEATURES AND WILL HANDLE COMCAST DIGITAL CHANNELS. THE REMOTE IS ANNOYING TO USE.
7009,1,Almost Perfect!!!,Very Fast shipping. Product arrived in perfect condition. Pins were a perfect fit. Washers were all same size there should be one slightly larger than the other per set... No big deal though.... since the washers do not move for proper door functionality I simply wrapped the smaller washer with electrical tape to give it a snugg fit and it works perfectly fine.... other than that small but fixable detail ... Perfect!!
7012,1,Hank Williams Hillbilly Hero boxed set,"This will give the casual listener some songs he may never have heard as well as the old Hank standards, but is not to be confused with The Complete Hank Williams boxed set. For some reason the songs recorded in 1952(and others) are not included. If this is not important to you, this is a great value at less than $20. The quality of the recording is excellent as is the packaging. Check out the other sets from Proper Records as each is a great value.Eddy's Song"
7013,1,Great Stuff,"I usually hear all kinds of new music while listening to the hardcore channels on www.di.fm or in this case, www.happyhardcore.com I really enjoy this fast (140bpm) type of music when I work out, though I like most electronic music in general. Personally, disc 1, mixed by SY is my favorite. I would say that it is mainstream happy hardcore. Disc 2 is more just hardcore/gabber. I find that disc 2 is more annoying than enjoyable to listen too. Disc 3, mixed by Kevin Energy, combines what the first two discs have to offer. Disc 3 starts out happy hardcore but flows towards the end of the CD into more hardcore rave like that found on disc 2. Overall, I like the set and to anyone looking to buy it, it would not be a waste of money in my opinion. The more I listen to it, the better it gets."
7014,1,Decent Option,"These flakes (often powdery) are better priced (even when ~$15 for 22 oz) than anything available near the metropolitan area where I live. Used to pour this on everything possible before I got sick of the taste, now I sprinkle for a hint of cheesy taste and B12/nutrition."
7019,1,IT SURE BEATS CRIME AND PUNISHMENT!!,"I just finished reading Candide for an Advanced Placement Senior English class, and suprisingly, I actually enjoyed it. Having toiled through many long, hard books troughout the year, this hilarious, SHORT, easy-to-read book was a relief! I loved the satire, and how Voltaire is constantly poking fun at people and their ideas--at times, I laughed out loud at the way he describes things. Although it is not the best book I've ever read, I definitely recommend it."
7022,1,Oh What a FAntastic Tale,"This is a hilarious romp through the 18th century world that Voltaire knew. This book provided him to make fun of the intellectuals of the day (cannibals who only eat Jesuits) the politics of Europe and the social mores of the elite. His characters include the noble Candide who combines his good heart with his reliance of Gilgamesh like helpers in order to succeed. His hero worship for Dr. Pangloss, the Rasputin like philosopher (and later Martin) bailed him out of some situations but perhaps more importantly his lesser, Cacambo saved his life. All of the fantastic adventures that Candide experienced were all designed to reunite him with his true love Cunegonde.Many years later, Upton Sinclair wrote a ""Candide"" like, utopian socialist fantasy novel, Metropolis that I was reminded of while reading this novel."
7027,1,Refreshing,"This was the first book by Garwood that I have ever read. She has the most intriguing way of ending almost every chapter with one liners that compels the reader to read on. In chapter 24 she carries the reader on an emotional climax only to have it come racing back to reality with one devastating line.I will definitely have to read more of her works, and would highly recommend her."
7033,1,"not one of her best, but still good!","I have always loved Julie Garwood's books and am ALWAYS waiting for her to come out with something new. Ransom is not one of her best books, but it was still good. She is such an exceptional writer that it seems hard for her top what she's already done. The characters Brodick and Gillian seemed to be missing something. They just didn't seem like they were as well suited for each other as some of the characters from her other novels. I was actually more interested in Ramsey and Gillian and really think they deserved their own book. That would be a GREAT story, I think."
7048,1,Great and intense...,"I am a histroy buff, and I thought this was a great movie. Very intense, very good quality production, war is indeed hell...."
7062,1,Sweet Read!,"Jim the Boy by Tony Earley is a sweet novel set in North Carolina during the late 1920's. Unlike other books set in the South of recent memory, though, this book doesn't describe an abused young man or a dysfunctional family but rather one of great strength.Although Jim's father dies only a matter of days before he was born, Jim is raised by his mother and three uncles who never married. Throughout the book, it is these men, who earn their livelihood from farming, who teach Jim some of life's greatest lessons. From learning how to hoe a field to confronting a firends devestating illness to seeing the grandfather he never knew as this old man lays dying, we as readers journey along as Jim experiences life between his tenth and eleventh birthday.Reminiscent of the equally lyrical style found in Plainsong by Kent Haruf, this book is a pleasant read for a summer's day."
7064,1,Lovely little book,"Jim the Boy by Tony Earley is a wonderful novel...beautifully written, poetic without being overblown or contrived, moral without being preachy. I recommend it highly."
7074,1,Sometimes it is good to be trapped!,This is first cd he produced on his own so I cut him some slack. It is a original concept for his cd. I love the guest appearences and the albums rhymes.
7079,1,Very balanced and fair.,This is one of the few religious books that just tells one side (the Roman Catholic faith) with no antagonism to any other side and no self-righteous pontificating! It is also very accurate as to what the Catholic Church professes to believe and why. This makes it a good book for non-Catholics to read who just want to know what Catholics really believe and function in their church.But it no easy read. This book is for serious study and not recreational reading.
7088,1,Good quality,This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount. Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though.
7103,1,Ok - alternate universe. So?,"Why people are absolutely clobbering this movie, I don't know. As a guess, I would say that the title makes you think of the video games, but this is aboslutely *nothing* like the video games, be warned of that from the outset. However if (unlike many others) you can get around the fact that it is completely out of the ordinary for the mario universe, you'll be rewarded to find a great movie with a quite interesting story. I only dock this a star because of the expectations issue. This has no business having ""Mario Bros."" in the title, but otherwise highly recommended :)"
7109,1,"Interesting, But Not Exactly for the People-Magazine-Type Reader","Mr. Erikson wrote a thought-provoking book, but it is certainly a product of his times. Such notions as homosexuality being deviant (his word, not mine) behavior and was more of a symptom of a psychologically damaged individual has not held up to present scientific evidence. Overall, the book is a fascinating dissection of childhood development and how it possibly manifests itself in adulthood. But reading this material wasn't exactly a cake walk. I doubt many casual readers could wade through Mr. Erikson's book without developing MEGO (My Eyes Glaze Over) Syndrome. For what it's worth, I enjoyed most of it."
7111,1,excellent!,"not a huge fan of Mia Farrow but she was EXCELLENT in this! this film centers around her and her husband who live in an old apartment building in NYC and theyre trying to have a baby. They have a few problems with a nosy old couple who turn out to be witches after their baby, and it turns out the husband was in it all along. no one believes her when she suspects these people, so they are all against her. i dont want to tell you the end, that would spoil it, LOL i know its fiction but the only thing i have a problem with the film is the fact that witches are always being portrayed as evil, and they are not...i guess alot of films would not have been made if they didnt believe that."
7117,1,Unbelieveable video and interesting stories,"Unlike most of the reviews here, I was able to play this HD DVD without any problems. I use my Xbox 360 to play HD DVDs, which is able to automatically get any updates that are needed.Anyway, the movie follows the stories of multiple Italian people, all of different ages and background, as they embark on different milestones in their lives. The video is full of beautiful shots with great hi-def detail. The narration really adds to the video as none of the people speak English.I definitely would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Italy. My wife and I went there a few years ago and were happy to once again see places that we had visited."
7125,1,Great Player!,"This player is a great one! But this player would not be good for jogging,because it skips a little when you jog."
7129,1,Interesting Nantucket History,"Having read the Mayflower by Mr. Philbrick some time ago and knowing how he was motivated to write that book, it interested me as to his motivation for this book. I was not dissapointed as the book is through in facts and presentation. As you already know, his writing is very vivid and complete not leaving the reader constantly guessing or speculating as to what transpired. Also it was a selection for our Sailing Book Club which motivated us to read it. Glad we did."
7131,1,"Good Book, Made Me Nauseated","I enjoyed reading this book. However, it did make me nauseated. Author goes into a lot of detail."
7138,1,Treat your relationships like the work of art they can be,"Funny, smart, erudite, Steve Chandler affirms that our biggest and most powerful erogenous zone is our brain. Chandler deflates the myth that love just happens---true love, whether of a friend or a spouse or a pet, is cultivated and created, over and over again. Great stuff."
7143,1,Works as expected,works fine..connects to my wireless network and doesn't tie up the phone line when downloading. no complaints..
7148,1,Great Purchase,Installed in seconds. Great performance. Excellent to eliminate phone line dependency.
7153,1,Wireless works,"Tivo Wireless G USB Nework Adapter for Tivo Series 2 works great. I have two tivo's which this allowed me to link so I can record different shows and watch them in either room and don't have to have wires everywhere. I like it, no love it. The price on amazon was about 20% cheaper than in stores I looked at. I would recommend if you have the need and interest."
7161,1,"Lots of money, but works",I got this for my TiVo series 2 box so I could use a better method of network encryption other than WEP. Worked great for that. It's heavy enough that it doesn't fly around like other plastic type devices. Seems to be a bit expensive.
7163,1,It's a NIC,Works fine with little to no configuration or setup. On a tivo it works right out of the box.
7165,1,Easy To Install,"The unit works pretty well most of the time but sometimes looses wireless connection with my cable modem. My installation places the receiver one floor below the cable modem with about 60 feet between the modem and receiver. The best signal strength noted so far is about 40% or less. Placement of the receiver can be critical, when I first installed it no signal was received from the modem and I had to relocate it higher in the room to get a only a minimal signal but it did work."
7173,1,Great Voice,"From the first time that I heard her on the Next Friday soundtrack, I was impressed by her voice. Listening to her album, you get to hear a great voice over quality production. To top this off, she did a remake of Guy's ""Let's Chill"" and it is tight. SHe is one of those artist who gives an even mixture of music tempo on her CD. There are ballads, fast tempo and mid tempo on here and the songs have meaning. ""Still Your Son"" and ""She Can't"" same to be personal songs and you feel them. Great CD."
7174,1,Great,"This is a qood quality vest, and it will work for a festival. I would say that it's more costume quality than I expected, and the gold grommets are pretty noticable. The vest doesn't look as much like suede in person. But my husband really likes it, and he will be wearing it."
7177,1,A personal favorite,"Panned by critics and written strictly to make money, I still find the story compelling and Faulkner's treatment of it excellent."
7192,1,"Original, Compelling Drama","""A Star Is Born"" the 1937 release is excellent drama and with the theme of fame and popularity. It is done in Technicolor, and is not the musical version with Judy Garland done in the 1950's. This original stars Janet Gaynor as a promising Hollywood starlet known as ""Vicki Lester"" - she came from a farm family, and her original name was Esther Blodgett. Sometimes her character tends to be an overly sweet hayseed, but she keeps her vital with excellent acting. Frederick March stars as the established movie star, ""Norman Maine"" who falls in love with and helps Esther start her career, but he realizes as her star rises, his is fading. He is a heavy drinker, older and a proud man. Seeing that he is sinking into obscurity, he cannot play second fiddle and commits suicide.This version stands up well even today and has great stars such as Gaynor and March as well as supporting cast of Adolphe Menjou, Andy Devine, Carole Landis, and Lionel Stander."
7198,1,Very good,"Here you'll find Elton John's music transcribed down to a tee. This is a welcome change to nonsensical 'interpretations' that conspicuously sound exactly the same as the melody line. You want to play 'Bennie and the Jets' from the starting heavy chords to the verse to the jazzy piano solo, here you go. Blue Eyes, Rocket Man, Someone Saved My Life Tonight (excellent song)... it's all here. In some instances (like Honky Cat for example), there's just no point in bothering to learn the music EXACTLY, because Elton John just improvised within chords in the first place. So it's best for you to do the same unless you want to pore through pages of the same music phrased slightly differently. Next time it would be better to include the more 'precise' songs in Elton's catalogue.Anyway, this is a great collection. Some of the songs aren't very well known but get the album they're on and you're away. Hours of fun."
7201,1,Quite a story,"If Big Foot Wallace actually experienced these events he was a great frontiersman, Or was he a great storyteller? Everyone interested in western history will enjoy this book."
7208,1,Of Mice and Men,"George and Lennie are very good friends. They are always doing things together and travel together. Lennie is the one who always makes trouble and Veorge always helps him. But now, Lennie just causes a serious problem that Veorge even can't help. Lennie is a huge guy, has a ind of a young child, and George is small and quick. Two of them are totally the opposite, not only the way they look, and the way they act, but they have a same dream. I like this book and I will recommend you to read it, because it is great and it will always give you surprise. Also, you will learn their friendship."
7209,1,Companions,"George and Lennie were the best of friends. Lennie was a huge man. He was a hard worker. Lennie was not very smart. He got himself into alot of trouble because he could not understand many situations. Lennie's main concern was to pet nice things and that is what got him into the most trouble. With his size, Lennie did not even understand his own strength. George took care of Lennie. He did all the thinking that Lennie could not do himself. He had patience with Lennie, while other could not. No matter what he still stuck with Lennie and took care of him. Together, they had a dream and wanted so bad to reach it that they felt it was always within one step their grasp.This book showed the greatness of friendship. I would recommend this book to my friends because it shows the meaning of friendship and patience. This book is about dreams and how important they are in pushing someone to reach them."
7210,1,Friendship,"Fiendship is very important to everyone. In this book Lennie always does something wrong, but he never know what is wrong. George is his only friend, always protects him from danger. They belong to each other. The ranch of Soledad is where they work. In this new work place, Lennie really keeps George in hot water and George has to make a hard choice. They have a sweet dream of land , which belongs to themselves. Will this dream come true? I like this book, because Steinbeck's story is so exciting that I held my breath until I finish reading to the end."
7212,1,Authentic tragedy,"This is an authentic, somber tragedy, set in early 20th century California. We follow a dreamer, and his companion who is a child in a giant's body. They travel from place to place on foot to find work then to finally end up on a farm where dreams and life come to an end.Stienbeck depicts these pathetic, hard, and lost lives with an eye for detail. This is a simple story with a simple dialect. A good read.LORD BlessScott"
7214,1,"of mice and men,tweety,kmb,at maces lane middle school","of mice and men is a great book.my favorite character is lennie. lennie is my favorite character because he is so kind, he listens to george and he loves rabbits. lennie is always talking about livin off the fat of the land and tendin the rabbits. lennie is always getting himself and george into trouble and george always get them out. george has to take care of lennie because he has no one else. lennie has to be careful on the ranch because the bosses son curly sufers from little man sindrom and he hates leinne because he is so big. this book is filled with suspence so i would recommend you to read it"
7229,1,Kevin M. and Jonathan D. at Maces Lane Middle School,"The book ""Of Mice and Men"" is about two men trying to survive in the great depression. One of the characters, Lennie, is a mentally retarded person that cant remember anything and likes to pet things. The other man, George, is a smart guy that is burdened with taking care of Lennie. These people are trying to make money to live on a farm. They come and work on this ranch where they meet many surprising people. This stories themes are dreams because Geaorge and Lennie dream about living on a farm and other dreams. Another theme is violence because it tells about some violence in the book. This also shows how life was in the great depression."
7235,1,Pretty Good....I've seen better DLC MLMS,"The book Of Mice And Men by: John Steinbeck was a pretty good book, not the best i have seen but pretty good. In the story there are two hobo's named Lennie(retarted) and George(sane). They have a dream of living off the fat of the land. They go arould the country looking for jobs to get a little bit of money for some support. They end up at a ranch working with alot of guys their age and enjoying the stay, but not for long. Lennie has been getting george in trouble all of his life, and now was not any different. In the end Lennie kills Curly's wife and George has to kill him. In the end, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head, with Carlson's gun. I would recomend this book to everyone who likes funny, but depressing books, John Steinbeck is a very good writer."
7247,1,Classic for a reason,"This book is a very brief but moving tale that will leave you thinking. Stienbeck's mastery here is in character development. He creates a cornicopia of characters in a genius way, quick and to the point. Somehow, in such a short amount of time, he creates characters you feel you've known your whole life.The scenery is well built as well, and the story itself is interesting and timeless. It could be set in 2006 just as easily, and still be relevant. It's a very relaxing read, and flows smoothly.You wont want to put this book down, and you'll only be busy about an hour reading it. This book is just as entertaining as I'm sure it was in 1937, and can be called a classic."
7256,1,Good book,"It was a short and interesting story, not complicated and easy to read. You would like it too. I recommendIt."
7258,1,Of Mice And Men,"I like Of Mice And Men by John Steinbeck because the definition of the characters was so realistic. I also liked the fact that it was in the novella form so the possibility that the story might drag did not happen.I would recommend Of Mice And Men not only to afficionados of Steinbeck, but to virtually anyone who enjoys real-life prose."
7265,1,"Pretty good, but not all new to me","I bought this book when my twins were 9 months old and I wanted some guidance on daytime napping, and a lot of friends had recommended Healthy Sleep Habits... I didn't mean to buy 'Your fussy Baby', since mine are too old for that- so be careful when you buy this package that you get both books. I had already read a lot of books on sleep training, and while there were some really good tips here, I found 'The Contented Little Baby Book' by Gina Ford more direct. Weissbluth allows for more discretion which I think a mother needs, and overall I think this is a very good book to be read in conjunction with other philosophies, and you can adapt what works for your style and babies. A must-read if your baby doesn't sleep very much and you think it is OK that way- it's not!"
7271,1,'Feel good' movie,"Every time I watch this movie, it makes me 'feel GOOD'! It proves that LOVE will find a way (although sometimes it takes a genius to figure out what that way will be).I loved the romantic parts of this movie, especially the idea of the 'first kiss' which Drew Barrymore got to experience over and over because of her short term memory problem.It could have been better without the crude humor but the relationship between Adam Sandler's character and Drew Barrymore's charactor is reason enough to watch this movie.The ending never fails to give me chills..it's heartwarming and terrific!"
7272,1,This movie is histerical!,"Yes Adam does always play the same role in every movie he does but I knew that going in. Overall I found this movie to be cute and sweet. I thought Drew Berrymore's character was great, she did a wonderful job and I thought her comedic timing was great.I also thought Doug(Lucy's brother;played by Sean Astin)he was so funny. I thought Sean Astin was extremely funny in this role.Rob Schiender is funny, but he is also always playing the same weird bizarre/your character scares me roles that he got a bit annoying. Overall though I thought this movie was really good and is a perfect movie to see if you are on a date!"
7279,1,entertaining,"Even though nothing in this movie resembles reality, the plot is funny and entertaining. Adam and Drew have chemestry. Overall it is a good natured romantic comedy that makes you daydream about the silly things that people do for love."
7291,1,music for piano and drums,"this music is a must listen for people who are piano's lovers and appreciators. the music that stimulatives, bring relaxation and brillian all at onces"
7296,1,Worth waiting for!,"I have been waiting for this CD for quite some time, and it was worth the wait. I think her first single ""White Houses"" is an awesome song, and the video is fun! She is very talented, and her growth as an artist is shown on this CD from her last one. In my opinion, there is still some room for growth though, as she continues to develop as an artist. Very much worth buying and listening to overall."
7300,1,I'm a Purist!,"Clay has THE voice and it is an awesome gift. The studio/production sound is not. Clay's voice comes through despite the over-production of this cd. This over-production sound (they say ""music""?) make so many cds the same. I would love to hear him sing with more simplistic background music, letting his voice carry the songs. Pure Clay! I wonder what type of cd Neil Sedaka would have (or still might?) produce for Clay. Yes, I was looking forward to the complete Clay-rendition of ""Solitaire.""All in all, this is a GREAT CD, especially for his first one. I admire his morality and greatly appreciate a cd that I can listen to with anyone w/o concern for the lyrics. Thanks, Clay!!! I look forward to your next cd...and your next...and your next......"
7301,1,Clay Aiken can sing...but not top 40!,"I'll admit that Clay Aiken can sing. There's no doubt about that. But the question on everyone's mind (as was on Simon Cowell's during the second season of American Idol: The Search for a Superstar) is does Aiken really have a voice for pop music? I agree with Cowell: His voice tends more to the Broadway musicals than to actual top 40 chart-topping. His debut is solid, though. I think he should've won the second season - he had the more distinct voice. MEASURE OF A MAN measures up...but just."
7304,1,Great Album. I love it.,"I've been looking forward to hearing this album for months. I love it! Clay sounds wonderful. Shine, Perfect Day, and Measure of a Man are probably the most well-written and well developed as far as production and writing on the album, but some of the 'lighter' pop material like Run to Me and Touch are incredibly sensual and full of yearning just the same. I could hear Run to Me on a movie soundtrack. There are a few specific production moments that are lame-that seem to be 'riffing' just to try to fit in more with what's out there and it doesn't quite work, but it only happens on Invisible and Touch. Overall, I really, really LOVE this album and I think harder rock, alternative music listeners would too. Several of the songs appeal to an alternative audience-people just have to get past the fact that Clay didn't write them himself, but he sure does sing the hell out of them. I'm thrilled that RCA found a balance between American Idol Clay and Recording Artist Clay. LOVE IT!"
7316,1,Measure of a Man,"At first I was a bit disappointed. But I have listened to this CD many times now and find there are some really good tracks. Clay's fan base is so diverse that he and the producers are trying to have something for everyone on this CD. Therefore, there are bound to be some that each fan likes better than others. I hope that the next CD will include some of the great songs Clay did on AL,like Solitary man, Buttercup , etc. I find Clay's voice powerfully moving and entertaining on this CD and I can't wait for the next one."
7320,1,A CD to enjoy many times and for many years to come,I have listened to Measure of a Man by Clay Aiken three times and have not skipped any of the songs. I don't think that I have EVER done that with a CD. It is very enjoyable and he did a terrific job for his first time out and I am looking forward to future CD's because I know they will only get better with experience. I am reserving one star for later when hopefully RCA lets Clay be Clay!
7324,1,Breath of Fresh Air,"Like the man himself, Measure of a Man is a breath of fresh air. Perfect Day is the most distinctive track, diverting from the power ballad style Clay Aiken has perfected, and sure to be a hit on the charts (reminds one of Elton John a bit?). This is the Night continues to evoke strong emothions even several months after we first heard it. My only criticism is that Clay is a top-notch vocalist who should take more risks with his style...he will surely succeed...with pipes like his, how could he not?"
7327,1,Aiken's album is tops for me,"I have read a couple of articles on the new Clay Aiken album, Measure of a Man, and I have to say I am very dissappointed in how people are bashing the albums songs. Personally, I love the album, I think that he can sing any song and make it sound fantastic, because he has an amazing talent. Maybe everyone should stop critizing him for not being what they think he should be, and start appreciating what he truly is, and gifted singer with a strong solid voice."
7335,1,2 months later.....,"I bought this cd immediately because I watched some of AI2 and was mesmerized by Clay Aiken's voice. Truthfully, I didn't expect much at first, as it seemed to be a hurriedly put out album. (I expected it to be cover after cover.) But, the first time I listened to MOAM, I was impressed! To those who criticise the lack of ""edginess"", you can get all the ""edginess"" you can bear from some of the rest of those ""artists"" out there....So going on two months later, where is that cd? In my home, my car, my husband's car....you get the picture. Clay should win a grammy for this cd!"
7340,1,Decent Debut,"Clay Aiken is one of my favorite singers from American Idol. My negative complaints about this album are: some of the songs on the album have corny lyrics and the album is overproduced. Overall, this album is a decent debut. Favorite songs: I Will Carry You, The Way, Run To Me, Shine, This Is The Night, Perfect Day, Measure Of A Man."
7360,1,A great pop album!,"Finally a male vocalist comes out with a pure pop album that just send me to heaven. There are a few weak songs that stops me from giving this 5 stars. But there are some gems here such as ""When You Say You Love Me"". Great album and wishing him more sucess."
7366,1,gets better with time,"When I first heard this CD, I was very disappointed. It seemed that most of the songs were slow songs. About a week later, I decided to listen to it again. The more I listen to this album, the more I enjoy it. I would have liked some more upbeat songs like ""Invisible"", but the songs are really great. It's a good ""middle of the road"" kind of album. My kids and I are having fun with this album but I hope his next one is more upbeat."
7371,1,Talking Watch,"The watch speaks the time clearly, and it is easy to set. What I didn't like was that the watch is not water resistant.The company that actually sells the watch (Maxiaids) is outstanding. I had a problem after receiving the watch, and they exchanged it with absolutely no hassles. They even paid for the return postage."
7372,1,Works for me,"Actually, it was a stocking stuffer for a blind friend who also has the problem of low sensation in his hands. The design passed his test because he could use it. I couldn't say that for other products that are designed for the blind yet didn't work in a design sense."
7393,1,Still sounds good,"I've had this album since it was released. It was unusual then, and it's unusual now - but still good. Like a dark Tindersticks with distorted guitar. If you want to hear something different, try this."
7394,1,Barhaiya! Really excellent,"This is a fantastic resource. I have just received my copy and already I am in love with it. It is very well-written, and strikes a nice balance between the structure of the langauge and usability. I especially like that the author is no fan of prescriptivists, and so presents ""Hindi as she is spoke"". I would not say that it is ""better"" than Snell's TYH, but it takes a slightly different approach, and is, in my opinion a great complement to the other work.My only gripes are the way that all the devanagari is stuck at the back (grr!) and that I had to buy the book and CD separately. Even with those minuses, it is absolutely worth it, and I would rate it a must have."
7397,1,Great Read,"I stumbled upon this book at work one day, and after finishing it I bought the entire series for myself to add to my library."
7400,1,Sanctuary The Complete Second season,"This is an great serie. I don't have or want cable, I saw the show online and wanted to buy the DVD. Could not find in stores so I went to Amazon to find the show I want to buy. THe company delieved in a timely manner. How I just have to get season three, can't waite. I recommend this company they have reasonable prices and fast delievery."
7427,1,Good book,It was really good. And I think if u like Jules Verne's stories you should read twenty thousand leagues under the sea
7428,1,Kindle book - very smart &easy transfer-- excellent book to possess.,The book in e-transfer format for Kindle is very fast and hassle free. The book is in very good condition and the contents are excellent to read. Worth possessing. ---thanks
7429,1,Classic!,Literary classic that I am glad that I read. I just wish I read it years ago. I will have to go back to my childhood home to see if I can find the book I had when I was a child.
7433,1,"Great book, in a great size!!","I love Jules Verne's writing. This book is small enough to fit in a purse or glove box so you can take it with you anywhere. If you like steampunk fiction, or old west, read some Jules Verne"
7445,1,real interesting Book,"there was a time when SNL was on the Cutting edge of TV.but those days have long past&too be honest the plug on the Show should have been pulled at least 11-12 years back.but in it's early days it set the standards for shows like In Living Color""&what you see with ""Madd TV"" among other shows.I always wondered why the Show had so few African-American Cast Members over the years?Eddie Murphy is Missing something badly in here for me.of course you would want too hear Eddie Murphy reflect on the show.interesting stories on John Belushi.He was something else.this book deals with alot of various topics."
7446,1,A great read for fans of SNL,"I'm a big fan of SNL, so I was quite excited to get into this book. It did not let me down. The reading is very easy, and the format facilitates the transmission of information one wouldn't normally know: the writers, actors, producers, etc. do most of the talking here in short interview snippets, filled in occasionally by explanations of context from the authors of the book. It's a great situation, which allows for memorable moments like Will Ferrell saying Chevy Chase was the worst host he ever worked with. It's fascinating stuff, and I'd recommend it to any SNL fan."
7448,1,Saturday Night Alive!,"A legitimate page turner. As a fan of SNL I enjoyed each moment. I particularly enjoyed discovering that some whom I thought to be jerks turned out to be very likeable...of course the opposite also applies. To those who say SNL is ""not as good as it used to be"" I say it is so much better than it used to be. Don't get me wrong, I loved the originals and the Crystal, Guest, Short and Shearer years were fabulous, but Farley and Murphy and Gross and MacDonald and Sanz and Meadows and Ferrell and Morgan and Kataan and Fey and Fallon and Dratch are also great. It has big problems of course, too many hosts whose movie is opening that week, and characters repeated too often, but on the whole, it's always exciting and funny. I only wish that 'Live From New York' included more cast members."
7453,1,"Good Show, but sad.","I really enjoyed this movie. The sound effects are great. It's way more intense than the first one. I haven't read any of the books but, I would really like for there to be another movie. I believe the it has a really sad ending. All in all, it's a good flick. Watch it today if you like fantasy."
7464,1,Great Family Movie,"This is a great and fun family movies. The video is excellent. The audio, 7.1 DTS master audio was some what disappointing. The audio was average and by far, does not make the top 25 list for best sound (audio track) on blu ray."
7465,1,"Good, but not as good as the first.","I really like it. Of course I am a sucker for these fantasy movies. I even liked Golden Compass. This one was better quality than the first. But just didn't move me as much. I have only seen it once in theater and once on disc. Maybe as I view it more, it will get me."
7470,1,A good sequel,Not like the first but it is a very dark story in the beginning. Good special effects. Narnia is taken down a different path in this story line.
7479,1,Triumphant!,"This book gives an excellent insight into Booker T's life. The unknowns, the lack of a childhood and the fear that existed then is unimaginable. This book gives inspiration to those who would be thinking of giving up."
7485,1,great introduction to value investing,"In recent years I have been learning a lot about value investing as opposed to stock speculating. One of the books I've found most helpful in this process is this book from Curtis Montgomery. His application of the time tested ideas of Sun Tzu to the sometimes crazy world of investing is at times quite sublime. Filled with many examples from the real world of investing, this book is a great introduction to value investing."
7494,1,Best In Class,"I've used this product for years. I'm fair and with one morning application, I'm able to spend the entire day outdoors in the southern CA sun. Some great things about this product is that it doesn't sting like some other sunscreens, it has a good consistency (not thick or greasy), lasts a really long time, and really works.The only downside is that it makes a fair one like myself look somewhat pasty. It is a white lotion and leaves a bit of a white finish. I really wish Eucerin would market a tinted version."
7499,1,Not too shabby. . .,"Album editing is a terrible terrible thing. Sometimes it can lead to an amazing song sounding horrible (i.e. Capleton Pure Sodom version on More Fire) and on Thug Nature it reigns supreme. Songs like the opener Coochie Daddy and Buck a Catty are nearly destroyed by the record company's torrid display of editing. However, if you set the editing aside, which is terribly difficult to do, you end up with a pretty good record from the now veteran Spragga. Apparently Spragga set out to make a straight head knocking dancehall album, and he succeeded in doing just that. Check out ""Analogy"" on the Superstar, also used by the following track ""Bait"", ""Stunna"" and ""Di Rooster"". My personal favorite is ""Playa"" with one of the wickedest rhythms I've heard in a long time. Overall, if you can get past the editing its a very good album, definitely worth buying if you're a Benz fan, or maybe if you're a hip-hop fan that is starting to listen to dancehall."
7501,1,Very nice collection of hard to find Eliza songs,"I've been an Eliza fan since I first heard her sing ""Hard Times in Babylon"" and I thought I had every album she'd done. ""Retrospecto"" is an excellent collection of hard to find songs. What drew me to the CD was ""Wild Horse"" which also appears on a Putumayo CD ""Women's Work."" When I realized there were 19 other songs here, I grabbed the collection. I'm quite pleased.Favorites include:Wild Horse--luminous, you can almost see the wild horse of the singer's dreamsBuffalo Gals--great fun cowgirl songHer Melancholy Muse--beautiful pianoThis is maybe not the best introduction to Eliza. I'd think about ""Hard Times in Babylon,"" ""Beautiful World"" or perhaps ""Land of Milk and Honey"", but this is still a great CD if you know her work and love her voice.Rebecca Kyle, July 2009"
7506,1,How to Lie with Statistics,"The author in this book discuss little stories about ancient statistics that may or maynot be true. It's an interesting book with many photos to illustrate the sense of statistics and it's easy to read you can finish it in a day or too depending on your time. Very thin book with only 128 pages, I was able to fit it right into my pocket book with no problems. It's a very good book belive it or not I had to do a paper on it which was easy because the book give me plenty of ideas and examples to use which help me complete my project."
7510,1,"Great, but not up-to-date",This is a great book. It does however have at least one SERIOUS short coming. The figures are very out of date. It would be nice if the examples were taken from the 90's or at least the 80's. Most of the statistics in this book are from the 40's and 50's. Good general information but could use some additional updating.
7516,1,Fine introduction to a great altoist,"One of the greatest Ellington's solloists can hardly be adequatly presented on a single cd, and that's the main reason why I give only four stars to this collection of romantic but swinging music.Could the choice of the great alto-sax player's tracks have been better?Probably, but there are more than enough top class performances on this CD, so anyone interested in learning what Johnny Hodges was all about - in Ellington's band and in smaller groups - is well advised to purchase this edition."
7518,1,chico hamilton timely,cheeks grove is the hook on this cd . chico has that groovy back beat and always a top notch band....worth a listen BIG DADDY
7523,1,hammer head,"I got the ""Dead-on"" hammer, I love it. However, in the website they would give a free Pry bar with it. I didn't get the free pry bar. their website sometimes confused me."
7525,1,Beat Takeshi's american picture,"Brother is a good movie. With the classic structure and style from the kitano's movies (it means slow, explosive and very emotional), now adding a different background: LA. (With a sceen from the beach like all his movies!) If you like the classical movies about jakuzas, samurais, and all the ethic from budo, hara kiris... etc. you'll love it. And if you like gangster movies with mexicans ""Cholos"" ""pendejos"", B-boys, nigg**S and that stuff, you'll love it too. Is not his best movie but is one of the most i liked."
7527,1,Very quick review,"I'll get around to writing a better review eventually. I liked the movie, and just wanted to point out that Denny revenge scene wasn't too light because he wasn't finished. Because of the ending events happened differently then he thought they were going to."
7529,1,Denso spark wires,The Denso spark wires were what I expected. I was a little disappointed that they did not have the seperators already attached. But all in all a good buy.
7532,1,Language,"In this country where English is a foreign language, it is good to know that some fight to preserve its propriety and eloquence."
7534,1,a good time for all,"Characters brimming with personality, and locations beyond imagination, it's hard not to get lost in the imagination of Periphery Stowe right along with Riggs.Though at times showing evidence of being a first novel, it hardly detracts from the beatiful prose and obvious skill the author has for writing.spread it around to your neighbors, your kids, your neighbors kids, all will enjoy.I'm just wondering what tricks Wagner has up his sleeve for his next book.."
7548,1,This CD Rules!,"This CD is awsome! It has tons of great artists and really good remixed songs. It's perfect for partys where theres lots of energy and people are dancing. It is targeted for people who enjoy pop music and I'm surprised that no body has revieved it before! I had this CD but it was misplaced and I absoloutely loved it although I did get tired of the Eminem remix after a while. The oridginal ""My Name Is"" was soooo much better!"
7549,1,Mixed Feelings,"The rice cooker has a lot of functions that we love!! Mostly we like all the automated settings that it has. The ""throw the stuff in there and start at a certain time"" is awesome! Especially because the housekeeper can prepare the rice for us and set it to start cooking later on that day. The little chime that it plays when the rice is done is really cute. Sometimes the rice is a little hard for our hispanic taste...perhaps, that texture is fine for other cooking styles. It takes soooooooooooooooooooooo long to cook. We like making the rice mushy like our cuban parents made for us which takes a long time. It is a really nice size, especially if making large amounts of rice is necessary in your kitchen. It is perfect for when we have guests. The design is cute but it does take up a lot of counter space. Overall, if I would be purchasing one again, I might not opt for this one but i'm not completely disatisfied."
7556,1,So far so good,I've only used the bike rack once but it worked just fine. Easy to mount and steady on a long drive.
7558,1,Great product,Finally I found bike rack that fit for my car 1995 Toyota Celica. This mount rack goes over the spoiler. It's very sturdy to carry my two mountain bikes.
7574,1,"Not exactly, but good anyway.","I'm not a huge fan of Elton John, but I loved this CD! I was hoping for more of the music from the movie itself, especially the Kline/Branagh version of ""It's Tough to Be A God"", but I was very happy with what I got. I do hope that Dreamworks releases another CD, with more of the score and the Kline/Branagh song, but I'm still very happy with this cd."
7580,1,Interesting stories of American heroes during WW2,This book was an interesting colaboration of stories by Tom Brokaw. It takes place during World War 2 and touches on every subject for combat heroes overseas to heroes in America making supplies for those overseas. I really enjoyed this book even though some of the stories were a little slow and not action packed. Still they were writen with good insight to give you the feeling you actually know the person. There were many man and women who put their lives on the line for their country and they need to be remembered so that the youth of America will learn the lessons they are telling. Overall this was a good book with good explanations and descriptions even with the occasional story that I think should have been left out.
7582,1,Good Book,"I purchased this CD for a college assignment on the war generation. I picked a perfect book. Tom Brokaw truly captures an entire generation with detailed accounts of their heroic challenges they faced. I believe that the only downfall to this book is Tom Brokaw's voice. As nice as it sound on TV doing the news, it seems to be a bit monotone. It started to drive me nuts several times while listening. I guess that's why I chose to purchase the book on CD so I could just stop it at any time and then pick it back up an hour or two later. Overall, it is well worth the money."
7591,1,Golden Dawn - Updated for our times,"The Golden Dawn by Israel Regardie updated by the Ciceros is a very complete edition. It is a hard read, only because of the detail and sheer volume of information. But it is very illuminating."
7593,1,"Very good on preparation and appreciation of tea, would have liked more on the processing","The strengths of this production lie in the detailed instructions for the preparation of various types of tea, mainly Chinese, and the bits and pieces of tea lore imparted in the interviews (although individuals familiar with the world of tea aren't going to learn much new from them--but it does bill itself as an ""introduction"" so no surprise there). The videography is artful and the selection of tea vessels used during the preparation of the various teas is a visual delight. My only real complaint is that the amount of footage of the processing is much less than I expected from reading the promotional blurb. Personally I would have liked to have more material on the processing."
7594,1,bose system,"I am really happy with my radio/cd player, it has great sound, and I am not having to go into my daughter's room to use our stereo, which is right below my neighbors' bedroom, the sound quality is perfect, and I definetely have liked everything that I have purchased from Amazon over the years."
7597,1,Historic and amusing,The cards are a mixture of characters and caricatures of golfers in the far distance past.Masters and duffers combine in an interesting and amusing collection. The dress is so different to what the modern golfer wears. Collectors will value.
7600,1,Great for Beginners!!!!,"I bought this set and was glad I did. I wanted to learn to speak, read, and write hindi. Within 2 weeks of buying the book, I was able to pronounce and recognize the hindi characters, as well as begin to read some words. I cannot say that I became conversational, but I can pick up words here and there when someone speaks to me. I appreciate the listen and speak lessons that the tapes/cds provide. It is really important to learn the different sounds of hindi, especially some of the sounds are not ones we use in english at all. I recommend this for beginners. if you really want to advance though, you have to take what you learn, and talk to a native speaker, because that is the only way you will advance is if you use what you learned. This covers the basics to get started."
7601,1,Comforting,"I got this for a friend who had a miscarriage. I first read it and was very moved, often to tears. An excellent book! Recommend getting this along with two other (in my opinion) even BETTER books: I'll Hold You in Heaven Remembrance Book and Mommy, Please Don't Cry."
7602,1,"It was a good book. It is a good healing book, journal.",This book was very good to help with the healing process. I used it for a journal and it's a great reference book! I would recommend this to anyone who has lost a child.
7609,1,Great show,"This is such a great video to teach your child about self esteem. Plus, it's just plain silly! I really like Larry Boy and his suction cup ears. Boy, do these guys really like to act silly! My toddler just loves watching these guys and it really is refreshing to see something so positive for a change."
7616,1,Good read,this was a book recommended for a class i was taking; it did deliver solid information; good book : comprehensive and inspiring.
7624,1,New rice cooker,"It does take a long time (2hrs) from brown rice, but it does come up perfect. I tried the quick cook and the time was down to about 75 minutes. I did see the same unit in the Food Lion from about $60 less. Should have looked there first."
7626,1,Zojirushi rice cooker,It does a good job as a rice cooker except it takes a bit long to get the rice cooked.
7628,1,Rice is nice,"When I first decided to buy a rice cooker I went to my local department store and purchased a small one. WHAT A MESS!!! it went all over the counter, it took longer for clean up then to cook the rice. Well, I returned that brand and started reading bout all the different types of cookers.After I read all the reviews about this rice cooker I decided to give it a tryI am very pleased. It is very consistent no problems.Even the quick cook is good. I cook my brown and white rice and it is perfect each time. I haven't been able to get my steel oats to come out the way I like yet.All in all a good little rice cooker."
7630,1,Isolation repairs a split personality.,"Lots of people beat stress by turning to large bodies of water. They swim, they fish, they daydream on these waters. The Atlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf--they each have calming properties. But our heroine hasn't heard of the healing properties of blue water, so she turns to an isolated cabin practically buried in the snow. Her healing starts when physical pain from the cold snow intrudes on the life of her mind. Each of her split personalities pulls together as she first succombs to her inner pain then triumphs over it. Survival in a snow bound cabin becomes her first priority. The reader is asked to make a tremendous suspension of disbelief in order to accept the heroine's cat with split personalities too. But if you can accept that she talks to herself as one of several personnas, then why not her cat?"
7631,1,I use as a desk chair. HAHA,I use this as a desk chair. I am one of those people at the office you laugh at yes.... but it really helps my back and helps me to do little exercises while I am on the phone.
7641,1,Slowdive meets Radiohead,"Very nice couple of songs. ""Winternight"" sounds like early Radiohead or Catherine Wheel with a slight Slowdive atmospheric sound in the background. A nice mix. ""Jumble Sailing"" has kind of the same atmospheric sound to it, but is a cute pop song. Too bad their album ""Lido"" isn't all like this."
7645,1,Fast becoming one of baby's favourites!,"""Get your fingers ready to twinkle...""That's how storytime begins with this book, which will encourage active participation even in babies who aren't signing.Very cute pictures of babies and helpful captions for parents on the pictures of signs make this a book you will enjoy together again and again.The series is slightly inconsistent in that only one book - Itsy Bitsy Spider - features a lovely REVIEW of signs on the back page (maybe they had an extra page because that song is short?). I found the review very helpful, and wished the other books in the series had one, too...it gives the baby yet another signing sing-along opportunity!Still, I think Twinkle Twinkle is her favourite of all these books, and we have had many MANY requests to read it in just the few weeks it's been here.Recommended for ages 1-2 only, as it's a very basic song that older toddlers will probably not sit still for for long."
7647,1,Bones 3-Bike,"I bought this rack to halt 2 bikes most of the time, and for this task the rack does a phenomenal job. With 3 bikes however, I find the spacing is a bit tight. I have a Subaru Forester hence it is easy to put the rack at the back without folding it. But for a smaller car folding the rack and expand it again can be a 5 minutes job."
7652,1,Menotti's Amahl,"While the video presentation of the opera is truly early TV (Black & White, etc), the production is absolutely fabulous. The acting, the voices, the story is very moving. I feel privileged to have it in my collection."
7653,1,Christmas classic,"I didn't read the description carefully enough and did not realize this was made in 1955. I would have preferred a more modern staging. However, the singing was first rate and I enjoyed it."
7659,1,My son-in-law's favorite,"My son-in-law could not believe we had not seen this movie so we bought it for a vacation time together. It was interesting, not exactly what we expected but it was fun."
7660,1,A Connecticut Yankee is a wonderful all time classic!,I love this movie and was so glad when it finally came out on DVD. The Emperor Waltz was just an added bonus because I only got it for the first movie.
7662,1,Two classic Bing movies,"I bought this movie because I wanted to see A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. I hadn't seen it since I was a boy and I remembered really enjoying it. But I had never seen The Emperor Waltz. Both movies are classic Bing movies, where he is the Sauvé ladies man who sings his way into girls' hearts, but I actually found myself enjoying The Emperor Waltz better than Yankee. It wasn't nearly as silly as Yankee and it was quite romantic. If you like Bing movies I'd definitely give these a try."
7666,1,Nice addition to my collection,"Quick shipping, good price, nice colors, wish the brown/plum was more plum than brown but otherwise nice! Much better than paying full price or higher price in stores, will order from here again"
7670,1,Good enough to buy,"After checking it out of the library, I found ""Goodbye, Columbus"" good enough to purchase for my personal collection. What a riot this book is in parts. I had a class in college where we read parts of it to ""show what a chauvinist Roth is,"" but I really didn't get that impression when I read the *entire* novel.And the scene where Ron is listening to his graduation album just cracked me up.Don't remember enough about the short stories to comment with any authority, so I'll leave those alone."
7672,1,Typos,No doubt that Philip Roth is one of our most talented and courageous writers. Too bad this Kindle Edition is so riddled with typos that they distract from the power of the prose.
7677,1,Great value for prep material!!,"Questions cover, with excellent difficulty, all areas of exam 70-229. These are the style of questions all Microsoft exams should contain to maintain the credibility of their certifications.This review is a good heads up on how Microsoft is changing their exams to cover hands on work experience versus fact regurgitation. Very handy sample Exam on CD with Questions randomly generated from the Readiness Reveiw.A better publication than the 70-229 Study Kit."
7685,1,Very thin,The shirt was for my husband. It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he wouldn't wear it by itself.
7690,1,Muddy is Clear,"Someone reviewed this CD and said it was Muddy's best and I beg to differ. ""Hard Again"" is probably his best CD but this one is very good. The selections are all well known but it doesn't matter. If you like the blues and appreciate the various nuances that performers can add to their presentation then you know that no matter how many times you hear Muddy perform, say, ""Mannish Boy"" (No B ooh chile), each time presents a different revelation. McKinley Morganfield, through his music, remains a giant."
7693,1,You Nasty,"Short remains steadfast w/this release. Production varies, even E. Sermon drops by w/a dope beat for Short to spit to. If you're a fan you will not be dissapointed. His lyrical pimp hand remains strong throughout the duration of the record. Add it to your collection! PEACE"
7697,1,Oasis's most definite.,"I have recently bought Oasis's Definitely Maybe album as a DUAL-CD, where one side of the CD is the album and the other side is a DVD. The DVD stuff is pretty cool and hilarious at times, especially with this one crazy British guy, who keeps on flipping-out during the interviews. Definitely Maybe is a great album to own, but you know...I always had one problem with it and that is the recording quality itself. The album just sounds muffled! I can't believe recordings from the early 90's already sound a bit primitive now a days, even though they are on CD's. I began to notice this with a lot of my albums from the early and mid 90's. Although, I think Definitely Maybe was recorder with a style/techniques that makes it sound even more muffled. Oh well, it's still a great album and most DEFINITELY Oasis's best."
7705,1,Great Product,"Love the product b/c you can take it with you. However you can do a lot of the same things with theknot.com, Wedding Channel and other great sites online. But I still recommend this for any bride who wants to be organized. Could use a part on guest lists and how to pick them, sit them, etc."
7714,1,The Witch of Blackbird Pond,"Kit finds herself alone in the world, and so she makes a decision to surprise her Puritan aunt and uncle and hope that they will take her in. From the start Kit has trouble in her new home; the Puritan lifestyle is strick and not at all exciting, and Kit keeps making mistakes without knowing it. She finds a friend in an old woman who lives by the pond, and unknowingly brings herself and this woman into danger.This book is a great read for children; it's interesting, historically accurate, and not scary."
7719,1,An interesting look back in time,"It was a good story. I thought the title of the book was misleading and an odd choice compared to what the story was really about but I liked how the characters were easy to distinguish from each other and were memerable. A great ending. I learned something from it too, on how people were treated during the war when they were not from this country - which is sad. Though it wasn't one of my favorites, I'm glad I read it."
7720,1,This is one good book,"I've heard from alot of people how boring this book was. For me it was ok. I love the plot but the whole setting in the 1600s was what I didn't like, and one chapter was all dedicated to some political guy, I didn't like that either. So some parts are really boring other are ok and other are REALLY good, for example the last part, I love that part. I love that sorta thing."
7727,1,Highly informative book,"This book is great to aid people when they apply to major colleges. The author include tips and things that he notices, when he was/is an admissions councelor, to help people be accepted into college. The book also teaches the reader on ways the reader could prepare themselves for letters of recommendations, interviews, *essay writting*, and obvious course that students may take in high school that will appear on their transcript. Will definately aid people with college applications."
7735,1,Rainbow's End,"I highly recommend the book Rainbow's End by author Bob Adamov. From Civil War intrigue to Lake Erie island suspense, it is action/adventure packed with a touch of romance. Great reading from start to finish."
7737,1,Maybe not Oasis' best but still way good,"I don't see why critics and even other Oasis fans keep downing this album. And I certainly don't see why it was thought such a failure . . .""Some bands will never sell that many records in their whole career"" . . . With the exception of Magic Pie (it just rubs me the wrong way) I like every song on this album. Be Here Now is one of my favorite Oasis songs it's just plain head bobbin', foot tappin' fun. Don't go away is by far the best track on this album. And I love Girl In the Dirty Shirt. Oasis rocks and I'd like to talk to anyone who feels the same so e-mail me at yub_yub@excite.com"
7739,1,Oasis,"oasis is a very talented British rock band reminds me of the early days of the British invasion of the sixties somewhat like a mix of the Beatles and the Rolling stones.Be here now by oasis,is a overall good album so if you,re into British rock? I recommend it and give it 4 stars."
7743,1,New Sound,"If you want the best Oasis for the Oasis sound, purchase ""Definately Maybe"" or ""The Masterplan."" If you want a great album of a different sound, buy ""Be Here Now."" The band was on its best behavior and performance, taking the time to make 12 quality tracks.Some of the top tracks, ""D'You Know What I Mean,"" ""Fade In/Out"" ""Magic Pie"" and ""All Around the World."" I hope that on their next album, Noel takes the time to sing lead on a few more songs. I have yet to hear a bad Oasis song with him singing lead."
7745,1,Bringing water to life !,"It's always a burning desire to capture as close the minute details in a scenary picture or the scenery itself. Water often proved to be the hardest to express its formless self.This book discussed in details the interpretation of water features using the different media like oil, pastel, water colour. All along, it had been thought that watercolour produces the best details with depth. But the book shows that other media can achieve similar effects as well.Many examples are discussed in step-by-step approach and illuatsated in sequences to teach about the built-up, so it's a simplified step to learning. Many medium are explore adding to the variety of expression that beginners can explore.Well formatted and recommended for beginners and intermediate painters."
7753,1,A Princess of Mars,"The writer of the original Tarzan character books uses his wildly creative imagination to create a story line which follows this hero John Carter from the aftermath of the Civil War to his mysterious transportation to Mars. Carter engages with the nine feet tall red warriors and the ""little green men"" (Is this where that phrase originated?). Mars is strife with the same racist animosity as his dear Earth. His fantastic ability to power through the gravity of Mars places him in a position of power on the planet and enables him to play the hero in big and small events on Mars. The Princess? Yes, she is lovely and lovable, and a bit of a warrior herself. E. R. Burroughs wrote this book for a WW II audience, so your grand or great-granddad and grandma will remember this writer through his books, movies, and TV shows."
7757,1,A Princess of Mars,Extra ordinary in both its imagination and the age in which it was written. By far the best of the Mars books. Burroughs ability to paint landscapes with words and easy delivery of emotional gratification makes this worth the read.
7759,1,Excellent Read!,"I am sorely disappointed that the movie John Carter did not incorporate more of this great work of fiction. It keeps you riveted from the start, the Barsoom of Mr. Burroughs would be a astonishing place to visit."
7763,1,Great Story and Presentation,Burroughs tells his stories in a way that captures your mind and involves you. The Princess of Mars we wholly unique and refreshing!
7765,1,Hooping Fun,"I really like the video ""Hoopnotica"". The instructions are easy to follow but hard to master. I'm glad I can rewind. I would recommend this video to everyone how wants to learn to hoop."
7772,1,"Nice, could be bigger","Very nice! Great quality. I was surprised, however that I could actually use a bigger one. Even when I make just one latte, my espresso machine does such an awesome job at creating foam - my milk generally foams up and over the pitcher."
7775,1,Okay product,"I've had this steaming pitcher for a month and it is already rusting, however that can be fixed with the right cleaning product so it doesn't really bother me. This pitcher is really sleek looking and holds 20 ounces if you fill it to the top."
7778,1,"A little rough, but worth the low price.","I received this product on time and it has been a treat to read these books. It was kind of strange though, because my copy of the Fall of Reach is very worn, but the second two books are brand new. I guess I can't complain though. I recommend these books to anyone that is interested in science fiction, even if you have no interest in the Halo series of games."
7780,1,Did you like the game,"If you like the game and don't mind reading you'll love the book. The book the Flood is pretty much a recap of the first game, but First strike is about the area between Halo one and two. Also, Fall of Reach tells where Master Cheif came from."
7781,1,great books for the scifi and video game lovers,"excellent source of entertainment and knowledge of the Halo universe.Love the books, love the game. Love the game, love the books. It's thatsimple."
7785,1,Marxist Critique of Love and Marriage,"I echo the sentiment that this is not a self-help book. If you're Joe Six Pack looking for some quick-fix PowerPoint presentation style solution to your marriage problems, you won't find that solution here. If that's your lot, just find a therapist who can set you straight in person. This book is a good old-fashioned Marxist-style critique, complete with denunciations of the connection between love and capitalism. In some ways, this book is more about capitalism than it is about love. I just wish Fromm were still around to write a book about Internet dating."
7789,1,GREAT SONG!!!,I REALL LIKE THIS SONG....VERY CATCHY IN WORDS AS WELL AS MUSIC.MY FAVORITE VERSIONS ARE:THE FULL INTENTION MIXES!GRAB A COPY...WELL WORTH IT!
7790,1,I'm a pretty big sugarcoma fan,"First of all I have to comment on what someone said about Otep down there, Otep will always kick Sugarcomas ass, in every aspect. Better screams, better lyrics, better music. Actually the screaming here just sounds like she's constipated, but I still love the cd."
7792,1,Chicane and Bryan Adams...together at last :-),"Dont Give Up is one of Chicane's most commercially sucessful tracks (alongside Offshore and Saltwater) and i thoroughly reccomend it. One major gripe i have is that there are only three tracks on the CD, thus not making much value for money, but this track , which makes Bryan sound good, is still worth it. The Tomski mix is probably the best, with the strings at the beginning (at around the 2 minute mark)a beautiful addition."
7795,1,Great Ideas with some entertaining philosophy,"I highly recommend this book. The techniques in the book really do work, no matter what one thinks about the philosophy behind it. I'm 23 and have been running regularly for about 12 years, though only semi-competitively for about a year. In my sophomore year in college, I was training for the possibility of going into OCS and ended up overtraining. I suffered a relatively serious stress fracture by doing the things that the author of this book warns against. I recently completed a marathon using the techniques in this book, and was amazed at the improvement in my time, and the way my body felt after the race. These techniques are solid, especially for experienced runners looking to improve their distances/times. The Eastern philosophy sprinkled throughout the book is entertaining and, as with all philosophy, good brain candy to chew on."
7798,1,HowI Rate my Baseball Pals.,"This book was a really good book. I especially like how it's a sports novel but also explains life lessons. The story is about two friends that both want to pitch for their baseball team but the team only wants one pitcher, one of the friends is the captain of the team and decides the positions and assigns himself pitcher. The other friend feels left out and they split up. This book has some great morals, 1. Don't single one person out. 2. Let everyone try. 3.realize your friends. By: Dominic, A Sixth Grader from Mainep.s. Matt Christopher ROCKS!!!"
7803,1,Good Analysis / Poor Solution,"This book provides a good overview of what children should learn year by year, subject by subject, and how parents can help them achieve their educational goals. One reviewer complained that the authors overemphasized the importance of limiting T.V., and reading to kids, but I am a teacher and can tell you that many parents don't bother to take those basic but crucial steps with their kids. The authors offer a good analysis of the problems with public education today (which both parents and schools can contribute to), but their main solution to the problems of the educational system is standardized testing. As a teacher in Texas, where high-stakes testing rules the public school system, I have learned that placing such overwhelming emphasis on an annual test does not raise the standards of students' educations; it has actually caused too many schools to teach to the test, cheat, and neglect the needs of gifted students in order to prep the slower ones for the tests."
7813,1,Workout - not instructions,"They aren't entirely clear this isn't a linear follow up to the first DVD in the ""Series"" which is focused on technique and movement. This one is more of a straight up workout dvd that is presented over 3 levels depending on your own fitness level. It's not bad and I do hope the series comes back."
7817,1,Quality Bose product,"As usual, another quality Bose product, however it is tired and has been replaced by a newer version of this model which I understand is more effective at canceling out noises."
7821,1,Backgammon Attache,"This backgammon set is beautiful and if you like backgammon, then it is a great addition to your game repitoire and worth the value."
7829,1,Content of CD,"I was a bit disapointed by the CD, I thought it would be much more music that could be recognized from the movie. When I heard the 1st track movie scenes flew across my mind, but that was the only one! Maybe exept for track 13. If you like french rap, this is CD gr8. If you just want the movie music, get the 1st and 13th track somewherelese..."
7832,1,A powerful novel,"You may find this book slow-going at first, but stay with it. As Orual begins to ""find her niche"" she develops into a fascinating character and a strong protagonist. I thought this novel was extremely moving and highly enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys C.S. Lewis, mythology, or a story featuring a strong and likable female protagonist."
7836,1,Great product - customer service not so good.,"Of the 12 lights I bought, one didn't work. I'm still waiting for the company to tell me how to get the broken one replaced. I'll change my rating when that happens."
7838,1,Easy to work with it!!!,"It is really easy to work with it.You can create and write wherever you want, using the whole space or half of the card.Perhaps it just doesn't have a variety of clip arts available, but a least you can import pictures from anywhere.It works perfect well with Avery cards, you just select the model number and print."
7846,1,Scandinavian Cheese Assortment (2 pound) by igourmet.com,The recipients of the gift of four Scandinavian Cheeses were pleased and offered thanks for the items as well as for the considerate effort.
7854,1,"The Dark Side of the one they call, ""Batman"" A new side of the Bat Critter!","I watch the movie on Standard, but I finally watch the HD DVD version. Although the movie was ""Ok to par,"" the HD version is awesome and at times it is brilliant, yet at times it was just ""OK,"" I have it for my HD Collection but it doesn't top some other HD DVD movies (Seasbicuit or Phantom of the Opra). I love the dark side of Batman and that made this movie a little better than a playful hero. I'm happy with the purchase and its a good collection for your HD's."
7866,1,"Cool movie but NOT ""THE BEST EVER""","I know you recent movie goers have just come out of the theatre recently. I did too. We're charged up but don't get out of control. Get a Bat-grip on yourself. The BEST Batman movie was the 1989 Tim Burton original. Batman Returns comes next and Batman Begins is somewhere around there. The Schumacher ones,while not being superb, still have their moments.The Batsuit did make Bale look sometimes like FATman. The Batarangs were rusty looking and not cool enough. I like the action sequences and how the story circled on fear. The early training stuff seemed to go a little too fast.All in all, Batman Begins is a good movie. I just think people need to think twice before they label Bale better than Keaton. HEEEELLL NOO!!! :O"
7875,1,"Incredible film, above average blu-ray","Batman Begins is an all time favorite of mine and one I wanted to have on blu-ray. The transfer is excellent. At 1080p at 73"" (Mitsubishi 2008 DLP) the picuture is stunning. No macroblocking in fast scenes (like in the DVD release). Audio sounds amazing in 7.1.However the extras are a bit slim."
7878,1,A Serious Batman,"Batman Has always been one of my favorite comic heroes. This movie departs from the somewhat whimsical, goofyfied villans of the last few installments and returns to a more serious feel. It explores how Bruce Wayne evolves into Batman from his Ninja like training to his cool gear.His mentor becomes his nemesis in a great finale. This is a really cool movie. I am an amature film maker so the ""making of"" features on the dvd are a real education. My only critique is that some of the fight scenes are shot so in tight that you don't get a good look at the action."
7884,1,Better than the last two movies.,Fantastic come back for the film series with Christian Bale as the Cape Crusader starting his war on crime. Christopher Nolan recreates the series with a dark mood that almost rivals Tim Burton's first two Batman movies but he does lack the flare and the bravado that Burton brought to those films as well as the underlining sense of evil that Gotham had in it's core. Nolan meanwhile does give a sense of realism to the madness of the city and it's hero and that's where the movie big surprise is. I think that this is a great come back for the series and I hope there will be a sequel to it to see where Batman goes from there.
7889,1,Buy it,"Works. Simple product to use. Must be careful in nesting the bottom bracket to make the bike stand straight. I hook it on the down tube, lift the bike and slowly move it forward as I let it down. That helps rotate the stand under the bottom bracket. Need to watch carefully that it is nested properly and not up toward the hook."
7896,1,"Good, just touch pricey.","I picked up an iSkin for my MacBook Pro and I think it is great. It fits well and has a good feel about it. The keyboard backlighting is clearly visible under low light conditions. My only gripe is that it seems a little pricey for what it is. Still, I think it is a good investment for a laptop."
7910,1,An OK Book,"This is an ok book. It is action packed and holds your attention. I think that the main charecter, Dick Shelton, is a lot like many people today even though the book takes place in Medieval times. Dick did not know that he was fighting for his enemy Sir Daniel, the man who had killed his father. I think this is one of the best historical fiction books that I have ever read. I hope that you will like it as much as I did."
7915,1,good amp,"I wanted an amp to play MP-3 music, and this is perfect----simple, easy to hook up, and good quality sound thru my fairly inexpensive speakers.No complaints."
7917,1,"Good Product, Poor Documentation","This is a great product saddled with unclear instructions.The single biggest thing to note about this amp is:Input 1 is signal sensing. If you connect a source in this input that has quiet passages (like classical music), it will turn itself on and off resulting in an audible ""click"". This was made so it can turn itself on when it senses a signal is completely normal. So, if you plan on using it as an amp, you have one ""always on"" input. Other than that, it's a nice sounding amp for not a lot of money."
7923,1,A Beautiful Read,A beautiful read. And I mean beautiful. As I read I could envision see the beauty in the patterns being described. It is both history and description. I would definitely recommend this book.
7930,1,Need of New Editors!,"I love to read Bible stories in the fictional form. They add life to the old stories we've heard so often. This book does a great job in telling us the story of the ancient kings. I've read other reviews, and they speak of many typos. Well, in the Kindle edition, they may have corrected some, but they missed quite a few in chapters 18 and 19. Because I am a student of the Bible, I found some of the repetition somewhat tedious. It was still an enjoyable read. I wonder if we could get the rest of the books in the series for free when we find typos in them."
7932,1,Great Christian fiction,Lynn Austin beautifully combined the historical facts of Hezekiah's reign with her imagination of how one event may have led to the other. I was constantly looking at my Bible to be sure the scripture references were correct; they were!
7933,1,Exciting read,I really have enjoyed this book for it's amazing details that bring the listed bible scriptures to life. The research that was used makes it more credible as I also go back and read those verses in my own bible.
7936,1,Engrossing read,"AFter reading this, I had to search the Old Testament for the story of Hezekiah, Ahaz, and Isaiah. Very entertaining read. Can't wait to read the next one."
7943,1,You should have seen this already...,"This is just Five Faces Of Darkness, the five part third season premier from the original Transformers TV show. If you grew up back then, like me, then you should have already seen this yourself back in the day. If you didn't, or you're new to G1 shows, this is ok but not essential to your enjoying The Transformers: The Movie. The F.H.E. Video of these episodes has been available for rent at my local ... for years & years. Since it's not likely to be available here, check your ... or, better yet, go to ..., check out the CTLP and get your episodes on VHS from one of the many video traders/sellers who have many if not all G1 episodes on tape. That's what I did for the episodes I wanted that haven't been released by Rhino Video yet."
7950,1,Good book....little disappointed,"The book was an easy read for the in-training investigator. I was however a little disappointed by the one mistake about the Greenbrier Ghost, it said the year, which had the last 2 numbers switched in the paragraph, I probably wouldn't have caught it if it hadn't been for the photograph of the tombstone directly below it.Besides, that little mistake, I found the book enjoyable and it gave me a lot of ideas on what to take into my next investigation."
7952,1,Beautiful story but needs technical work.,"The story is lovely, and I am quite sure my grandchildren will enjoy it. The illustrations are sharp and colorful. There are two troublesome problems. First there is an incomplete paragraph half way through the book. Even worse is that it takes several taps to enlarge the tiny font. On some pages one tap did it. On others, it took several taps. A few times I gave up."
7955,1,Bjork rules!,"Bjork might be somewhat of an acquired taste, but even if you don't like her you have to admit that she is completely original and unlike any other artist out there. Bjork is always ahead of her time! Not all the songs on Post blew my mind but the ones that did (HyperBallad especially) make this album one of my favorites. Become a Bjork fan, you can always wow non-Bjorkers with her wonderful voice and melodic weirdness :) (Plus, Bjork is so adorable! I love seeing her in interviews just to hear her talk! :)"
7958,1,"Good here, bad there","This album is a mix of some really great songs, and some bad ones. Army of Me, while a decent song, does not allow Bjork to use her amazingly expressive voice, which is what makes her so good. Hyperballad is the best Bjork song ever, and the song that got me hooked on her. The Modern Things is good, not incredible. It's Oh So Quiet is awesome, great change of pace. Enjoy is decent, but sounds more like a song for Homogenic or Vespertine. You've Been Flirting Again bores me to death every time, I usually skip it. Isobel rocks, good beat and melody. Possibly Maybe also rocks, and falls just short of Hyperballad for the best lyrics on the album. I miss you is an embarrasment, along with the worst Bjork music video I've ever seen. The band that kicks in at about 2:00 saves it a little. Cover me is pretty boring too. Headphones is cool if you listen to it with headphones on.Overall its not the best Bjork album, but you should buy it just for Hyperballad, It's Oh So Quiet, and Isobel."
7962,1,Ringo and band on fire,"Having seen Ringo and his All Starr Band play live in Liverpool and Glasgow last June, I pretty much knew what to expect from this Blu-ray. I wasn't disappointed! Ringo plays to a formula that works a treat. He keeps the crowd on their feet pretty much the whole time with so many hits from both Beatle days and his solo career. What a treat to see Don't Pass Me By, complete with piano introduction! The band are tight and the picture and sound quality of the blu-ray are excellent. My only disappointments are that it runs for less than an hour, there are no extras on the disc and information about the gig and musicians is almost non-existent. There is also a mistake in the credits where the band is shown as including ""Mark Har"". The keyboard player is former Crowded House member Mark Hart. An unforgivable error. Having said all that, the disc is very entertaining and recommended."
7964,1,One Of Shakespeare's More Challenging Works,"Cymbeline is one of the later Shakespeare plays that is rarely staged and probably even as rarely read. The plot has elements that are familiar from several of the earlier works and many of the characters borrow from more familiar characters in other plays as well. Nevertheless, Cymbeline is a rewarding play to either view or read. The Arden version that I recently read was useful but for the footnotes which focused on various usages and interpretations of the language over time which I found distracting and finally chose to just ignore. The play itself because of the familiar elements will appeal to those who have read the better known works. Cymbeline revolves around a layered plot that includes the devices of mistaken identity, evil and deception , unbridled ambition and political intrigue. It is a rather long play with 5 acts and 27 scenes. Having the benefit of seeing this well staged would enhance the reader's experience."
7965,1,Different,"This cd was alot different than waiter. The first track is the next eight put together. Long ambiant phases between dark synth driven songs, much more digital than the pervious album. his vice is possibly better in this cd, definatly worth the ep price"
7971,1,Jesse a good story,"I liked this book , the story was interesting and it showed different sides of American culture from the eyes of an immigrant farm worker."
7972,1,Jesse,"This book is about two Mexican brothers,Jesse and Abel who are tired of struggling to be abel to live the next day. They both work long hours in cotton and grape fields to be abel to put themselves through college, but no matter hard they try things always get in their way.Recommendations:I think that i would recommend this book to everyone adults and my peers.I would like my peers to read this book because it would help them to see that no matter who or what comes in their wat , never give up but keep on going because if it is for the good it will only make you a better person."
7979,1,"Review of ""Fresh Cream""","This is a very good album. It was received as described, and I find the content to be very entertaining. It was, overall, a very good purchase."
7980,1,Interesting perspective on anger when secular view isn't enough,"We are doing a neighborhood discussion group based on this book; all of us coming from different spiritual affiliations. I have heard the neighbors saying it is a fresh perspective since they mostly hear the secular pychological views. So, they are ready for a new perspective. I figured the 13 step was like the 12 step for Alcoholics and included a spiritual view. I am sure the author was not meaning to bate and switch; just simply trying to appeal to the masses of all affiliations and of all different levels of understanding trying to offer something different for people to consider. It has dramatically helped me."
7988,1,Not opened yet,This is a Christmas gift for my son. He has a very nice red truck and always keeps it looking nice
7993,1,Remarkable work of history,"Benny Morris rose to the forefront of Israel's 'New Historians' in the 1980's with the publication of 'Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,' which provided radically new evidence which altered modern perceptions of the region forever. Morris retains his important findings in Righteous Victims and expands on them, covering virtually the entire history of the Israel-Palestine conflict. I found the earlier chapters leading up to the creation of the State of Israel on the earliest Zionist settlers to be particularly interesting; Morris presents a picture which indicates that the current bloodshed is by no means a product of natural necessity. The ethnic cleansing of Palestine and subsequent military occupation is the cause. However, Morris becomes overly ideological in the concluding sections of the book, allowing his harsh realist politics to creep in. Nevertheless, this is arguably the most comprehensive single volume about the history of the conflict."
7998,1,What a great product!,"We received on time...number 1. Number 2 we really like this. My girls, ages 9 and 10 are in soccer and the day they got it they spent 2 hours using it. Even my 6 yr old boy uses it and thinks it is awesome. The velcro straps that hold the ball in place are well made. It does take about 3-5 min. to put the straps around the ball depending on if the straps have been tangled with or not. Other than that...great product. I used it myself and it gives you a good workout and helps with coordination of the ball and ball contact reflex."
7999,1,Glad i ordered it!,"I recieved my steam Wizzard vacume yesturday and I sooo Glad I ordered it. The steam at first takes a bit to get started and it does drip water out (when ur done steaming use the vacume to clean up the water that dripped out :) thats what i did)while its warming up but when the water is warm enough the steaming works great i used it on my couch to remove an accident left by my neice. Steamed it, vacumed it and it came out very well!"
8003,1,A great ladder,"If you want to purchase the Little Giant ladder as seen on TV, watch out. The one advertised on TV has a 300 lb. rating and is classified as industrial grade. This one has a 250 lb. rating and is classified as a household rated one. All in all, both are excellent. This one weighs about 6 lbs. ligher than the industrial grade model. In addition, for those struggling with its weight, you could break it down to two ladders and save your back."
8005,1,"Not the best, but very good work","First of all, I have to say that I don't like disco music. Well, I've bought this album and I don't think I've made a mistake. I must admit that there is some I don't agree with (Body language - Freddie, what were you thinking about! ) but, besides Under pressure, Put out the fire and Las palabras de amor, some songs are real good stuff, such as Back chat and Life is real. Moreover, everybody has to admit that the songs are not skunky disco stuff, because in them there is a lot of hidden good ole rock."
8006,1,Soooo Bad..... I love it!!!,"Please, for your own safety, dont listen to this album without listening to Queen or QueenII. That might ruin your impression of the gretest band in the world. This album is so exceptionally bad it turns right around and becomes good. These songs are so horribly un-Queenlike, i was rolling around on the floor laughing. Now if you'll excuse me, im going to dance around the room to staying power..."
8009,1,"Even when they're mediocre, they're still good","Queen moves forward into the dance rave scene of the times of the 80's. It's not that bad considering. Just don't expect the heavy rock of early Queen here. It's all enjoyable, Freddie's ""Song for Lennon"", ""Put out the Fire"", ""Calling All Girls"" and ""Under Pressure"" are among their best. Remember, a mediocre Queen album is still better than no Queen album and even a mediocre Queen album is better than most bands could dream of producing."
8011,1,"Different, but still enjoyable....","Hot Space is not the same style as the other queen albums, but they just tried an other style, to see it's success. Not as succesful as they thought, but it is a good album. Songs like Staying Power, Action This Day, Put Out The Fire and others just may not be called worthless. Cause they aren't. Let's see how I rate the songs:Staying Power: 8/10Dancer: 8/10Back Chat: 6/10Body Language: 7/10Action This Day: 8/10Put Out The Fire: 8/10Life Is Real: 7/10Calling All Girls: 7/10Las Palabras De Amor: 9/10Cool Cat: 6/10Under Pressure: 7/10 (I know this is their greatest hit from this album, but I don't like it THAT much)That's my review about this album.Keep On Rocking!!!"
8026,1,Funny and interesting,"We liked this movie. It has interesting characters and subject that is at times funny, sad and touching. I would recommend it."
8031,1,Creative musical fun for sure!!,I love it! So does my 4 year old! He plays with it and creates different tunes & the price was right!!!
8033,1,freak come out at night,"r kelly goes back to his freaky roots on this one, if you wanna hear kelly talk about oral sex for the millionith time please get this, if you love bump-n-grind, 12 play and classic kelly then this is especially for you. fellas, ladies you better protection on this."
8035,1,R. Kelly's Biggest Fan,I love him...but I have to admit I'm kinda growing up and he's not growing with me. It's good but not his best. My favorite song is I Mean (I Don't Mean It)...totally tight!
8049,1,gone but not forgotten,"Dishing out heavy doses of moral philosophy, McDonald always keeps the reader entertained and thought provoked. Not quite on par with some of the earlier McGee's, but never-the-less, vintage McDonald. 30+ years of reading his novels, one can only morn the loss that Travis, Meyer and the rest won't have a new tale to tell."
8059,1,CONVERSE,THE SHOES WERE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY DAD. HE IS OLD SKOOL TO SAY THE LEAST. THE SHOES WERE LIKE PEOPLE BUYING THROWBACK JERSEYS. HE HAS NOT HAD ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SHOES. TRUST ME THE SHOES HAVE GOT TO BE COMFORTABLE OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RETUTNED INSTANTLY.
8062,1,Love them,"I've been looking for red chucks for a while now. I love these!! I would recommend getting a half size to a full size smaller though, they run quite large."
8064,1,Comfortable and Stylish,"My daughter shamed me into wearing these comfortable and stylish shoes, claiming that I was ""dated"" in wearing my regular running shoes. They are comfortable and I receive many compliments."
8069,1,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I received this scale just last week, and I am happy to report that it is everything I expected. I was sick of spending money on expensive digital (inconsistent) models, that stopped working after only a year or so of use. This unit provides consistent readings at eye level. It was simple to complete assembly of the two main pieces shipped in the box, and was simple to balance (and rebalance as necessary if the scale is moved)."
8076,1,"A Good Read, but not Gibbons' Best Novel","I am a big Kaye Gibbons fan, but I found this book to be a little weaker than the rest. The character development (usually a Gibbons strength) was not great. The book rambled a little bit. All that being said, ""mediocre"" Kaye Gibbons writing is still phenomenal by any standard."
8081,1,A Rough Start...,"OK, OK, we get it. You don't like or trust nobility. The heroine, Maddie, spends the first 1/3 of the book in a tedious round of snide insults with the hero, Quin, Marquis of Warefield. If you can make your way past the beginning, once a ""truce"" of sorts is called between them and she stops being so witchy all the time, I actually came to really like the story. The secondary characters were well done and I enjoyed what they brought to the story. By the end, I would have given this book 5 stars, but once I thought back on the beginning I knew I couldn't. As much as I liked the book, I don't think I'd read it again knowing I'd have to plow through those first annoying chapters."
8092,1,Not quite what i expected,"I expected to receive the album booklet/art with it, but received it in a generic case without the slightest bit of art. This was not mentioned online though the receipt with the item listed it to not have the art. Just a little disappointed that I'll need to hunt down the booklet and back art is all. however the album itself was in great condition, and read just fine."
8093,1,Pretty cool,"Most song on this cd i like. my favorite song is toxicity. i used to like chop suey but man, i've heard it over a million times. well, you won't be wasting your money. SOAD's first CD is pretty much the same. I bought this one first and you should too. It's rockin'. I would like these word to go out to everyone who reads my review ""do you cy when angels deserve to die?"" and ""do angels ever deserve to die"" well, bye. Don't forget to buy SOAD's Toxicity and there self-titled album it's not a waste of money."
8094,1,A lot slower but more into the vocals,"When system of a down's self title came out in 1998, I was most impressed with Serj's scream and the original songs that came out. The songs were fast and Serj's scream hit every song like bullets. I picked up this cd after hearing it off a friend.This album ""Toxicity"" is much more instrumental. Serj uses his voice more and Darren sings as well in Chop Suey and Needles. This album is much more wacky and different sounding than the first album. Songs like ""Bounce"" and ""Phsycho"" jumpy songs that don't capture as well as the other songs but ""deer dance"" and ""jet pilot"" not to mention ""X"" are catchy songs.This cd is great if you would want to hear Serj's voice and how he dramatically uses it in his poetic lyrics."
8096,1,"Original, yet classic",System of a Down is a great band because unlike everyone else their sound is so original. You can't compare them to any other band. Their lyrics are meaningful and are often humorous. This band is fast and loud and will make you crank it up and slam your head.
8107,1,Major Step Forward,"Let me start off by saying that I didn't care for the last album.This one however is light years ahead of the debut. Sonically it is phenominal, they got great sounds this time out.The songs are heavier and less quirky than the debut. There are some awesome heavy riffs with great grooves, however there are still some of the annoying (IMO) vocal interludes. Basically I tolerate these to get to the cool parts, fortunately those ""coolparts"" pay off big. Just saw them for ""Pledge Of Allegiance""and they were outstanding live."
8122,1,esay to recognize,it's very easy to recognize about leadership. i read more books about leadership more than 20 books. you know what? this books has importants keys of leadership on techinical side.
8129,1,Satisfying your supernatural cravings,"If you like battles against ultimate evil, religious overtones, and special effects - with a twist, rent Constantine. Yes, you have to suspend disbelief. Yes, you have to accept somewhat two-dimensional personalities. But if you get past that, you get a nicely shot, tense, supernatural crime saga with a couple of interesting characters. Most folks will have never heard of Constantine or Hellblazer, on which the movie is loosely based, but it's fine if you haven't. The movie is good enough on its own for an enjoyable night."
8132,1,creepy cool,"Constantine has accepted his fate and made peace with it. He knows that death and a hellish afterlife are imminent. Flawed and fatalistic, cigarette between his fingers, he plods along throwing himself into one horrific situation after another, in an effort to help a woman he doesn't even know. It's creepy and powerful. Angels, devils and friends. The guilty and innocent. Keanu Reeves is perfect in this role and it's a movie to watch again and again. Liked it a lot. Reminds me of Sandman Slim stories."
8143,1,"Typical Keanu, not so typical Constantine","This movie has almost no chance to make anybody happy. Constantine graphic novel fans will be disappointed because the character is changed and quite different from the books. Keanu fans won't see Neo (except for some time when Constantine was indecisive) and there aren't super kung fu fight sceens.That said, it's a slow moving, laid-back plot with a lot of back story which takes a bit to figure out. Rachel Weisz is very good but her character isn't developed as completely as it should have been. Keanu plays it very laconic (which, after all, is his strength) and it mostly works. But I think he should have been a bit more animated and I would have been interested in some sparks between him and Rachel.All in all, this is actually a pretty interesting movie, part The End of Days and part The Omen. I did enjoy it and I'm likely to get the dvd. Give it a rent, it's definitely worth a look."
8145,1,Great Visuals and some scenes will stay with you.,"I guess I'll begin with an admission. I moderately enjoyed the film when I first saw it even though I went to see it with someone who really didn't like it. But then a strange thing happened. Usually after I see a ""worthless"" film, I forget it within a week. However this did not happen with Constantine. I found myself thinking of some of the scenes even weeks after seeing the film. So it is a film that has stuck with me, and that indicates it has something special. I gather from the reviews that it appears to be a love it or leave it movie. I would be interested if the movie has ""stayed with"" any of the ""leave it"" group. For me, however, I have slowly fallen in the ""love it"" category, and I'm looking forward to the DVD."
8146,1,Great urban fantasy,"My husband wanted this for Christmas and he loved it. Ten more words are required so here they are. Take that, tips and guidelines robot!"
8154,1,Back to their roots.,"On this one, they go back to what they do best. This is a return, musically, to the sound they had on their first CD. They strip away everything else and just get back to basic rock 'n' roll, something they do better than most groups out there. My only minor comlaint is that the songwriting isn't up to their usual standards."
8179,1,You won't find the revolutionary Franklin here.,"This is a autobiography of his early years. He actually finished the second half of it thirty years later when he claims he has enough time & before he became too old. The two halves have been edited seamlessly. In this we see just hints of what England's future relations with the colonies will be. Franklin has considerable business relations with the British military & makes his fortune in business by the time he is fifty. He is just getting his feet damp in politics being one of the framers of the Albany Plan of Union in 1754. There is much in this of the Franklin we do not know. It is informal & personal. With all its facinating anedotes it would have been lost to the world if he hadn't been urged to write it. America first true international super star, but by the end of this book, not yet."
8182,1,Gentlemen,"Leader of this group of men going into the Yukon Gold Field was an English man who had vowed not to cross into American Territory, disliking Americans. He was admired by his three comrades. He was strong willed, would not ask his comrades to do anything he wouldn't do. Even when given advice from knowledgable frontier men he continued on his path losing the lives of two of his men. A wonderful description of the characters of all the men involved in this journey."
8184,1,It's a...WHALE...of a good time!,"Neat looking toy in terms of color and form. Resembles some kind of jetski or something. Fires four missles. One from the mouth, two from the fins, and one from the cannon on the handlebar apparatus. Mouth opens and tail flaps when rolled on ground. Fins even have a little articulation. Fits figures very nicely. Very fun and aerodynamic looking. Although I don't recommend doing it...I'm tempted to take this baby to the bathtub! Well worth it!"
8193,1,Seems to be working so far,I've been using it for about 3 weeks and haven't been very good at remembering to apply it every day but it seems to be working. I'm sure it would work better if I were more consistent.
8198,1,Almost there,"This is a great series, but like most anime, builds to climax near the end of the series. In this DVD there is some action but as usual, not all of the characters have shown themselves yet. So the final battle is not till much later in the series. this dvd still has fighting in it, but you might want to watch the later ones to see the better battles. its a great series and u should watch all the way through in order to get the full effect."
8200,1,"Youth, where are thou ?","Even though this movie is pivotal, and reflects a time long gone, even though the acting is great, I'm somewhat disappointed...it has aged!"
8204,1,Four friends...four pleasures,"Sharing thoughts, dances, and dining together was only the four-play. They shared something that only very close friends should ever share...and that night brought them closer together. Very sensual, very sexy...and a lot of fun. If you like RSD's, this is a good one for your colleciton. Terry is calling me to the bedroom...she just put in another RSD for a fun-filled Friday night...lucky me.Terry...I'll be coming shortly"
8206,1,Good Toy,My son loves this playhouse. He was only 12 months when we got this for him and loves going in and out of the house. the only thing i dont like about this item is that its easily knocked down by son. he leans on item and its always tipping over. i have to put heavy blankets to keep it up.its a great playhouse. spends lots of time in it! It also needs more balls. 50 balls is not enough it looks empty!!! if you get this make sure to buy the 150 count of balls to go along with it!
8212,1,The only thing needed for this purchase is creativity,"The Megaland by Playhut is excellent for little folks. It is durable and can take the wear and tear of cowboy and indians, space adventures to the princess in the castle. It has been turned over, stepped on, kicked, pushed around the floor and sat on by my year old son. My five year old and 3 year old have taken it a step further than the baby by making this playland their make-believe area. The balls are awesome because I get to keep them clean and they are very safe. It has been great for rainy days or when we can't get to the park. I have different pieces in different rooms. Since you can add on pieces I am going to invest in more tunnels. But you definately need a big play area when the entire megaland is set up."
8220,1,"Very cute play tent, great for small children","My 15 month old enjoys playing in her play tent a little, mostly just crawling through it right now. I think when she gets a little older, she'll enjoy it more. My only complaint about the tents are the velcro tabs that connect the tents to the tunnels and to each other. When you get kids tugging on this very light tent, the tabls can tear. It would be very nice if they made them to connect with zippers."
8233,1,20 Questions,"This is a very good version of 20 Q with a vast data bank. The only problem I can find is that it can't guess itself as the thing you're thinking of! You can set sound on/off (just beeps); answer yes, no, sometimes, or unknown; and the set speed of the scrolling. When it asks you what type of thing it is, things that are normally vegetable (like ""chair"" if it's made from wood, ""paper"", ""maple syrup"") fall under the ""other"" category. ""Vegetable"" only holds vegetables (parsley, spinach...)."
8238,1,a good bed,"We got this bed for our 2.5 year old. he loves it, sleeps well in it. putting it together was pretty easy, in some places the picture doesn't line up perfectly , but it's not too big of a deal, esp. for the price. It's a pretty sturdy bed, but I wouldn't let my son jump on it."
8249,1,A good intermediate book,"The book is well written and the author has done a great job to keep everything simple to understand even though he's talking about OOP! You'll get a good overview of things you can do with VB.NET, illustrated with good examples.Unfortunately, there is also many little technical mistakes in this book. Most of them might have been caused by the changes between the beta and release version of VB.NET but I have been disapointed to find so many of them! I thought that a book with the name Microsoft on it would be more accurate... It's not the case!"
8251,1,a tree growing up,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was a pretty good book. It was about a girl named Francie and she grew up in Brooklyn with her parents and her little brother, Neeley. It was a pretty good book because it showed you steps of growing up; it started out when she was around six or seven years old and all the way up to college. I would probably recommend this book to someone else to read because it was pretty interesting."
8255,1,Great Book,I haven't read a book in 10 years. My New Year's resolution was to read more books and this definitely didn't let me down. The story is well written and provides great insight into the early 1900's Brooklyn.
8267,1,Awesome!!!,"Review Clarification: This review is based on my viewing of this movie in the theater, and on Laser Disc. I have not viewed the DVD (any version).This is my favorite Clint Eastwood movie of all time, better than all the Dirty Harry, Spaghetti Western, and Sci-Fi/Space movies.I first viewed this movie in the theater, and I was completely blown away. I am disappointed that John Malkovich has chosen not to be in more mainstream movies, because I immediately wanted to see everything he was in, after watching this movie. (I immediately rented ""Being John Malkovich"" when it became available, and was quite disappointed when he was not the protagonist.) John plays a brilliant Psycho in this movie, and plays it very well. In fact, I actually changed my image of him after this movie. If I were to see him on the street, this is the only memory I would have of him.I recommend this movie highly. One of my favorites.MC White said: Check it out!!!"
8271,1,Interrogation Techniques,"Interrogation TechniquesOreste Pinto's ""Spy Catcher"" is about the art of catching and interrogating spies and special forces operators as practiced by a Dutch expert who worked for the British during World War II. In the first chapter, the author lists the qualities of the ideal counter-spy. Chapter two, deals with the extraction of information from suspects without using physical force to retrieve the information. The next eight chapters deal with actual cases and the author's role in them. In the eleventh and final chapter the author stresses the importance of perfecting our counter-intelligence procedures. This work is a highly interesting and readable book on a complicated art and science of interrogation."
8280,1,good enough,Does well unless you have huge feet (unfortunatly thats me) then a little care in which shoes go where is needed. It is a pain to put together.
8285,1,Good to have around,"I have a pretty small room and this shoe tree helps me maximise space.Its weight is a good advantage because I stack more than 24 shoes on it.Great product,cant wait to move into a bigger house so I can buy a bigger one"
8287,1,Great replacement for SRF-M70,"I own both the SRF-M70 and this new SRF-M75PM. This updated version offers an auto scanning tuner that automatically seeks out the next available station. This is especially useful when your traveling and have no idea what's on the dial. The only problem I've had with this unit is the hatch cover for the batteries, keeps falling off. I ended up taping it in place with some electrical tape. Except for this minor inconvenience, the new radio would have gotten 5 Stars in my rating."
8293,1,Electronics right out of 1983 but it works,"Soldered circuit boards? In 2011?Per instructions I mounted it high on a garage at 7.5 feet. We have wind right now and no false alerts.So, although I was taken aback by the 20+ year old technology, if it works, it works.So far, it does.The base unit does look like something you found in your mom's basement, though.Expensive, but the cheap ones never worked. I like the voice record, less jarring than an electronic alert."
8295,1,Good System,"I've used the Voice Alert System for about a month now. It works good but does false trigger some. I've tried moving the sensor and adjusting the sensivitity and it has helped. I may just need to tweak it a little more. It has never failed to trigger when someone has entered the area, which is the important part. I don't know that I would hook it to a siren but I'm very happy with the system. Instructions that come with the unit are very good but where a little unclear about how to hook up the external devices to be trigged. I plan to add a light to be activialed in the warehouse for night. I did buy an extra sensor for the driveway and some of the false alerts there are casued by birds flying in front of the sensor. It's a good 120' away and the base unit is inside a brick building in an interior room (2 walls). It picks up all traffic in the drive. Good system for the money."
8311,1,"Not as good as the first, but still very entertaining","This is the second novel in the Temperance Brennan series. Supposedly, because it's winter, work should be slow. Unfortunately for Temperance, it is not. She has a nun to identify and a house of burned bodies in Canada, and mysterious deaths in Charlotte. Not to mention that she has classes to teach, and a somewhat difficult sister to deal with. Still highly entertaining, and I really enjoyed the addition of some sociology elements to the story. A lot of similarities to the first one though and it all seemed to tie up a little too easily for me. All in all however very entertaining and I will definitely continue to read this series."
8319,1,A fine read but not as good as Deja Dead,"I was very excited to finally get to read Death Du Jour, and while I wasn't disappointed, I was expecting more. The setting and the crimes were great, wonderfully thought out with great descriptions, but I felt the story lacked the emotional depth that Deja Dead had. But I did read Death du Jour all in one sitting, so that says something about the quality!"
8324,1,A good collection,"I 've always liked this release for the following tracks: Ghosts of Cape Horn and Make Way for The Lady. The others are fine too with the sole clunker being the wretched The Auctioneer which is so out of place here. If I want to hear that nonsense, I'll go to a cattle auction. Originally a digital recording, it suffered from tape hiss which is odd for digital(the early days of)recording. The hiss is gone but the recording still doesn't sound right to my ears particularly the vocals. Suprisingly, this is a very short disc clocking in at a paltry 33.50. Another entire release could have easiliy fit on the remainder of the disc. I hate when labels cheat the consumer in that fashion. So be it, still worthwhile for some very good tracks. 10 tracks/full lyrics/33.50."
8334,1,Very pretty,This is a really pretty ring for a nice price.It shines a lot and seems to be very well made.The only think I don't like on it is that it says MADE IN CHINA in the inside.I would be a little ashamed if I would buy this ring for a gift.
8339,1,good movie about moonshiners,We like movies about moonshinning and bad guys and then there's comedy like the dog and romance. then this all happens with all the water.
8342,1,Feels good and smells great,"This product was not as ""tingly"" as some others, but did provide solid anti-fungal protection while I was traveling. I think that the product does what it says, but it's hard to truly quantify it since I was using it in conjunction with other products."
8343,1,Works well,Worked well on itch. Its certainly no miracle cure. Like other reviews say you have to use it everyday. I will probably buy this again.
8348,1,to pricey for me,"its a nice product. leaves you feeling clean and fresh , but the price is a bit outrages for the amount you get. (over a dollar an oz). i might pay 7 or 8 bucks for 13 ounces but 15 ? no thanks. 30 dollars every month or so for soap doesn't fit my budget. i gave it 4 stars for the product alone , but it certainly isn't a good deal."
8350,1,worked but for something other than what I bought it for,"My husband has developed a case of Tinea Versicolor in the last couple of years. Last fall, it got really bad, it was all over his chest and shoulders and was spreading up his neck. I found this product on Amazon and read a ton of reviews. I thought this would help him, or at the very least not make it worse. Unfortunately, it didn't have any affect on my husband, but... in one of the reviews someone commented that their daughter took their bottle because it worked on their acne. I have adult onset cystic acne and it had exploded on my face recently, so I thought, ""Why not"" so I tried a little on my face and thank goodness. It helped calm my face way back down. It didn't happen overnight, but consistent use with my regular regiment really got it under control. So at least this product worked for one of us."
8353,1,Flashback to childhood,"I ordered this DVD with the expectation that it'd be an amusing return to childhood diversions of getting up early to watch Star Blazers before school. I was pleasantly surprised how well it translated to DVD and how well the story held up. No, it's not a work of genius, and I had hoped for some ""DVD special features"", but it was everything I expected and then some."
8372,1,Good old music,"Us old farts need music too. I had it on a record and wanted a new one, because I enjoy this old real music."
8375,1,Interesting intense read,"Wonderful and classic work by Abbey. His descriptions of his desert surroundings take my breath away. Less engaging are his diatribes against the forces bringing in ""progress"" to the wilderness."
8379,1,This book may not be for everyone.,"The book was very interesting from a woman's point of view. There were things that I never knew. For example, I always assumed that women were the meek and unrespected sex of the colonial period, when in fact they were well respected. I did think that there were too many diary entries."
8390,1,For those with an interest in Philippine or World Music,"This album presents an impeccable recording and beautiful instrumentation and some very pleasant vocals. Like the country itself, the music represents a mix of the hispanic, asian and malayo-polynesian sensibilities. For those who have a deeper interest in Philippine culture, this is a must-get. But also for those who love authentic musics of the world, check this out. You won't be disappointed."
8391,1,Awsome!,"Brazilian movies can be real good, this one is not an exemption. Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas made an intelligent and exeptional movie. Just don't know why it was produced in black and white. Watch ""Central Station"" as well, you won't be disappointed. By the way: the song in the end of the movie is called ""Vapor Barato"" (cheap vapor) by Gal Costa."
8394,1,Heidi,"It had been many years since I had last seen this classic. It is a wonderful movie for any age. I thought I had remembered it a certain way and then when I saw it again, it was like I was watching it for the first time. What a difference watching it as a senior than when I was a child. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
8398,1,Crazy but good!,Watching this insanely disfunctional family makes one feel good about their own life. The show quickly grew onme and became addictive.
8436,1,A good introduction.,"""The Elements of Reasoning"" offers a good introduction to using logic as a basis for making arguments. If you want to improve your skills of debate, or familiarize yourself with Aristotlian rules of rhetoric, this is the book for you. I read it and enjoyed it, although much of it was familiar and a bit obvious. I think even an observant viewer of Sunday morning political shows will be familar with the techniques covered -- inventions, conjectures, definitions, as well as the age old structures of syllogisms and enthymemes. If you are already familiar with such things, no need to read this book."
8438,1,awesome,"I have not yet bought this CD, but I did see her play live in Maui last week.... She has an amazing voice, you will not be disappointed!"
8439,1,Good movie,I haven't seen this movie since I was young. I think high school years. I watched it yesterday for the first time in year's and I remembered it being a little bit more funny and fun to watch. Still was a good movie though. I like the guy who is always being moved around and just wants his red stapler.
8441,1,cult classic,"This low-budget sleeper from the mind of Mike Judge is a quirky, funny film that cuts to the quick of corporate America. It skewers the hierarchy of the typical soul-stealing, cookie-cutter/cubby-hole workplace. You'll never look at a stapler in quite the same way again."
8444,1,Office Life,"Exactly why i quit my office job, I laughed so hard, all while an intense anger grew inside me towards my old bosses. Damn printer !#@@#@, i hate you.The movie stays funny and on track at first, well at least through 3/4 of the movie and starts to get a little to serious at the end. However i own, love it, seen it too damn many times now."
8449,1,Awesome,"This movie was great. All the characters were soooo funny. Between the guy with a nervous stutter to the nerd who jams to rap music, I couldn't stop laughing. With a story line the everyone can relate to, and a scheme everyone would do. This movie is a great movie to rent if you need a good laugh."
8468,1,"A great novel, but not the best","When I first read this novel, directly after readingCat's Cradle, I was disappointed. There was something there that I felt that it lacked. The normal Vonnegut wit and humor only surfaced momentarily. But after much recollection about this, I feel that it is indeed a truly tremendous and well thought out story about a man discovering his own inhumanity. I highly recommend this novel to the experienced Vonnegut reader, others should be weary. (Also see the movie! A great adaptation."
8473,1,Steinbeck is good but E.B. White is better,"Steinbeck's book are often quite earthy and rough. I think he had a macho image he wanted to maintain in part. He was a good writer (Noble prize, Pulitzer) and ""Travels With Charley"" is a wonderful book. It is not in this collection however. I find it difficult to swallow his profanity and it is never necessary (read Dickens for instance). In comparison, E.B. White had a gracious side to his writing, a wonderful subtle sense of humor and a beauty of economy with the English language. I like them both but prefer White. I mention the two together because they were both writing at the same time. They were both perfectionists and both hated to be in the public spotlight."
8477,1,Anna continues to change the world,"""Darksong Rising"" is a worthy successor to the two earlier books in the series. Anna is a believable (and enjoyable) character, and her attempts to wrestle with a new world are good entertainment. The transformation of Defalk continues, and her efforts make a really enjoyable read. Yes, she does whine a bit much about her exile from her children (although in this one at least a hint that she might be recognising that her new life is better). Yes, her sexual frustration over Jecks is also a bit much, too often. But she is entitled to some complaints, given the calls made upon her for selfless sacrifice to help others. I agree too that we could do with a bit less of the ""men are dreadful"" line. But her magical conflicts are excellent, and I would recommend the series to any fan of fantasy."
8478,1,Good overview of the civil war,"I was half way through the first volume of Foote's epic 3 volume ""The Civil War: a narrative"" when I paused for a breather and read Catton's Hallowed Ground.So, compared to Foote's 3 volume The Civil War, Catton's Hallowed Ground provides a good overview of all the major battles in the Civil War. He had also included quotes from letters soldiers had written to family which I thought was a nice touch as it provided a different view of the civil war and illustrated how tough things were for them. What I also liked about Catton is that he had referenced the quotes and pointed to other books if you were interested in that particular regiment or battle.For someone new to the civil war, I would definitely recommend reading Catton's Hallowed Ground first then refer to Foote for more detailed description of the more interesting battles. However, as another reviewer here points out, there is a hint of bias in favour of the confederacy in Foote."
8490,1,F Troop Review,The best show ever to come on televisionI can`t wait for the next season to be released.
8499,1,Perfect for my 1998 Ford Contour SE,No problems with this product because I read and followed the directions. Contrary to the previous customer review this was a cinch to install on my 1998 Ford Contour. I am thinking of ordering a second one for the back so that I can have a pseudo rallye look to my car once I get my windows tinted.
8503,1,get to the point,"My most serious complaint about this book was the fact that it dragged out so far, and had so much irrelevant stalling. Who really cares about Larry Kramer trying to get ""the girl with the brown lipstick?"" In fact, a good portion of the book concerning Larry Kramer could be omitted, as could many of the ceaseless droning about the parties Sherman went to. They're irrelevant, so leave them out. I wish that the author had spent a little more effort on the ending, which is incredibly disappointing, with no real resolution. What kind of book ends with a paragraph to resolve the last 300 pages? Wolfe should have spent a little less time spinning his wheels, and a little more time making it worth it when you finally get to the end."
8505,1,great but not as good as DC Encyclopedia,"The bottom line is that I love the characters of the Marvel Universe and this book rocks the house. However, I feel that the DC Encyclopedia is superior in every way.My main criticism is the amount of space given to certain characters. The Mad Thinker and Alicia Masters get almost a full page each - while Black Bolt, The Rhino, and Deadpool each get a whopping 1/8th of a page. Kind of a drag!"
8509,1,Great book,"If you are a fan of Marvel comics, this book provides a history of Marvel comics and in-depth of characters."
8520,1,What I expected,"These headphones delivered exactly what I expected from a $41 set, good sound but lacking in the noise-cancellation department. The fabric cord with an extension piece is nice and the design makes it fun to wear. The switch for noise cancelling on/off is well located as it doesn't take up room on a seperate piece or on the cord and the foldable design makes the headphones relatively easy to transport with big pockets. Basicly, everything one can expect from Sony for $41. (Since flying with them I would change this to a 3 review... they just didn't deliver much with the noise cancelling."
8526,1,Ancient History Atlas.,This is a great little book. Unfortunately it covers the peroid just prior to the peroid that I was concerned with. It is concise and clear and would be of value to any one studing that peroid of time. Sue Coon
8527,1,Extended Analogy fallacy,"This book is an excellent read. Lewis manages to speak intelligently on a subject which is mostly surrounded by bluster and dogma. His logic is ultimately incorrect, however, and he makes numerous uses of the Extended Analogy fallacy. Still, it was an enjoyable read and it got me thinking. Though I do not agree with Lewis's conclusions, I enjoyed the road he takes to get there."
8528,1,Enjoying C.S.Lewis,"I find his books to be great insights into being a Christian. Had read several of the books in previous years wanted to share his writing with friends. ""The Great Divorce"" is such a clear picture of hell. I highly recommend the set."
8530,1,MERE Christianity,"If you have read Breakfast With Bonhoffer, and liked what you read, then I think you will like this book. It goes into detail about Christianity and how to understand the real meaning of the whole concept between the two books."
8537,1,Great author,"Great books by a great author; Screwtape letters really makes you think. I can't wait to read the rest of the works. The book itself, however, was HUGE! I was not expecting it to be the size of a textbook haha. Thick, yes, but tall and wide? No."
8544,1,Reliving the Exodus,"What can I say about the Movie ""Moses"" Staring Burt Lancaster other than it does an excelent job of actually following the Book of Exodus in the Bible. THe directors try to keeep the charachter Moses to how he was potrayed in the Bible. Moses stutters so his brother speaks for him to Pharoah. The plagues and the parting of the Red Sea has such realism that you can picture the biblical descprition while viewing it. Mannafalls from the trees like bread from heaven.I reccommend this version of the story of the Exodus over any other due to its absolute parralelism with the Biblical Story."
8548,1,Tantrum tamer.,"My son received this as a Christmas gift when he was 2 1/2 months old. Now 5 months, he's still a little too young to execute the movement, but the ""press the button, then ponies go 'round"" concept continues to fascinate him. It sits on the top shelf of his bookcase and after a traumatic diaper change, we walk over and spin the ponies . . . crying bout ends!"
8550,1,High Quality Music- One of Their Best,"I have never been a huge fan of Sawyer Brown but liked some of their songs. I bought this CD because I really like ""Drive Me Wild"" and after listening to the whole CD a few times I was amazed my how good all of the songs are. My favorites are ""Moon Over Miami"", ""800 Pound Jesus"", ""It All Comes Down To Love"" and ""We're Everything To Me"". It is obvious that this group spent considerable time creating this album with the excellent writing, producing and singing. I have about 5 Sawyer Brown CDs and this is my favorite. Highly recommended for any country music fan."
8559,1,one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time,I loved this movie and I would recomend this to any Vince Vaun or Ben Stiller fan. this is a laugh a loud every minuet film and just written very well.
8560,1,Funny and worth the time to watch,"Sure it's predictably but it's funny and fun to watch. Ben Stiller and the rest of the cast are great. I especially like the out takes where they show the team getting clocked by the wrench, I'll admit it!!It's a silly movie, just what I like :)"
8566,1,So interesting it's worth a novel.,"When I saw the book Clipperton in the display window of a New York book store I had already been planning to write a novel about this strange island. With the additional information the book provided my plans became more concrete then. After a decade and many many rejection letters I finally found a publisher in Harbor House, Augusta, Georgia. The novel will be published in the fall of 2006. Thanks to Jimmy Skaggs; his book is interesting and well documented. A find for island lovers.Karl Berger M. D."
8584,1,Funny Girl,We liked the movie even though it had a very sad ending.Barbara is a great singer.It has some very funny parts
8588,1,"A very well written, sad and sometimes irritating story.","This is a sad book! Going through it, you can't help but feel sorry for Jude. He tries so hard and seems to fail at everything he's ever wanted. He's never really had any adult role models when he was growing up. This has made him vulnerable to the ploys of people like Arabella who tricks him into marriage twice. As for Sue, although he considers her the love of his life, you cannot help but wonder how she truely feels about him.All the females in this book are so flawed in so many ways. Arabella is the master manipulator as for Sue, she has some quite peculiar theories and ideas. Sometimes it makes them irritating.It's pretty sad and almost heartbreaking to see this man give up so much of himself for his love and to suffer so much for it."
8592,1,"Please 2, 3 stars what is it that you like about TROOP?","Well 1st off if u like Jodeci u will like this cd. It most definitely has that feel and they keep the TROOP sound. Don't know what they were listening to when they rated the CD so low. The cd was on Hammer's Bust it Records label. The 1st six songs are slow, track 4 has the ""What About Us"" feel. The last 5 are mid tempo and they are decent, guess they wanted the album to be DEEPA but DEEPA type songs were on the DEEPA album. So I encourage you to buy the album if you're a TROOP fan or not, you won't be disappointed."
8597,1,"Excellent for Induction, Quality is OK","Needed a universal pot for my Duxtop Induction burner. I knew this was rather small which is what I needed to feed one. I like to cook pasta and veggies. This works great as an all in one pot for that. As to quality, you get what you pay for. It seems study enough, but I can tell after a few uses that the inside bottom of the pot with discolor and wear quicker than a higher quality pot. For the money this is a great pot, just know you are not getting All Clad."
8605,1,Works OK but you need extra adaptor if using headset and HDMI for 360.,"The HDMI cable works OK with our plasma (someone was asking if was only for LCD before) but if you are using it with your XBOX 360 and you have a headset (Turtle Beach-type, not the regular ones) you'll also need the adaptor for audio OUT. I should have checked before, because the adaptor by itself is more expensive than cable and adaptor together, at least here in Amazon. Otherwise, no problem. Recommended, especially for the price."
8616,1,It should be a horror film,When i saw this on t.v i was only 4 and I was totally scared. I found the red bull terrifing. It then stayed at the back of my mind for aged. I just remembered it as scary. But when my i saw it listes in the t.v paper I told my 4 year old sister. I deicided to watch it with her thinkin I would realise how silly I had been. After they started hearing the Bull I started to get scared. I almost had to leave the room. I felt really stupid when my sister was enjoying the film a lot. I dont no what it is about it but it should be a childrens horror. Defintaly a sleepover horror im actually old enough to rent myself!
8617,1,"A little too scary for toddlers, but great for older kids","This is an absolutely lovely movie, and was one of my favorites as a kid. However, just a quick warning to parents: despite the pastel-colored cover, some of the action may be too intense/adult for very young children. Even re-watching this film as an adult, I found many scenes downright scary! The few swear words have been edited out, but I always found the worse problem to be the scariness factor. I think one of the reasons this movie has always been more of a ""cult classic"" than a true blockbuster is due to its never quite finding the right audience: some elements (the few songs, the Rankin-Bass characters) are simply too childish for grown-ups, but the story is a bit too dark for small kids. I would say 7 to 11 is the ideal age group. However, even adults who enjoy a haunting, beautiful story that is a little off the beaten path will find this classic worth the pennies."
8618,1,"Delightful, whimsical and an all around good fantasy story","My four year old is positively obsessed with unicorns, we rented it from a local video store a few months ago and now we have to buy it or I'll go broke renting it!! I have watched it with my daughter several times and it is quite enchanting as far as the theme goes. The animation is typical Japanese style and the music typical early 80's! But to little children who live in fantasy worlds 95% of the time, this is a good movie."
8619,1,The Last Unicorn Anniversary Edition DVD,"My little girl and I both really liked this DVD, especially the enhanced 5.1 sound and cleaned up video transfer.Really, my only gripe with this edition is the small edits that remove a couple of uses of the words ""damn"" and ""hell,"" that I recall were used in the older versions.As far as price, order accuracy, speed of delivery, and payment and shipping accuracy, I cannot complain at all.I ordered online on a Saturday afternoon, and it was waiting for me before the following Friday."
8621,1,Lovely and exciting production,"An all-star animated film with a wonderful and captivating story for the whole family. Piece of trivia: The voice of the tree belongs to Nellie Bellflower, an actress when this was done, but now a film producer, having produced ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day""."
8623,1,Warning,"I have always loved this movie and the DVD is worth the wait.A little word of warning though, this is a ""Full-screen edition"" not widescreen.Ultimately all I can say, If you like this movie it is worth buying it."
8629,1,the silver sword by linda,"When i first heard the silver sword was a war book,i thoughtit wouldn`t be so good but it is.It`s about a girl called Ruthand her brother Edek , her sister Bronia and a boy called Jantrying to find there mum and dad in Swizerland.Ian serrailleris a good author he has good ideas and a wonderful imagination.He describes words exelently although he sometimes does boringsentences.The silver sword can have some good parts and somebad parts but theres some bad parts like when they where in theriver and they were going down stream it got dull and boringbut it got more exiting.I would recommed this book to 9-12 children because i know they would like it."
8630,1,The Silver Sword,"The Author is Ian Serraillier an it's published by Puffin.The story is about a family that is seperated during the war and Joseph goes looking for his wife in Switzerland and a few years later the children go looking for there parents they are Ruth,Edek,Bronia and they find a kind helping follower that has got no parents and that is Jan.Jan is my favourite character cause he is daring.Ruth is my least favourite character cause all she does is just and worry.My favourite bit is when Jan gives Bistro the chimp a cigar.The least favourite bit is when the boat crash's.I would reccomend it to all ages from 5 to 13 year olds."
8640,1,"Magic, mayhem and Merlin can be found in this new jem.","Anthony is seen as a villain by the people of Abandon Island. His brother, who lived on the island, recently died, and Anthony is selling Abandon to a powerful politician in return for certain child labor laws to be pushed in Parliament. Morwenna is a resident of the island. She fears the advent of new ownership. The new owner's hunting lodge will be built over old standing stones, and the traffic of his friends will destroy the fishing industry and leave some two hundred people without work. Morwenna's father was an Arthurian scholar, and she is trying to complete the manuscript he was working on before his death. She is also looking for Merlin's cave, rumored to be on the island. And all the while, she is trying to talk Anthony out of selling the island while trying to ignore her attraction too him... not too successfully.... Morwenna is a fabulous character with her many cats and her belief in magic. You'll believe, too."
8648,1,"Beautiful lip gloss, feels great on the lips","I love this lip gloss. Bought the color Coup de Coeur, and the color is fantastic for my medium-toned, peachy complexion. I bought one for my mom, too, and now she won't wear anything else on her lips!"
8652,1,An Inspirational Pararescue,"The book really gave me an idea of the training and gratification that goes along with military rescue forces. Perhaps if you are not very interested in military, you will not find the same respect as I did for ""Pararescue."" If you are a military buff, read it!! I've been on the phones with the 106th talking about a flight slot!"
8659,1,a little too slow paced,"If you like musical, you'll like this movie. For me this movie is a little too slow paced. I do like the drama part though. My five-yr-old daughter and four-yr-old son like the story too. I first watched this movie when it just came out at the theatre. I was too young to undertsand and slept through most part of the movie. Watching it again was fun. Wish someone will remake the Cinderella story with real people."
8666,1,Enjoyable.,"Easy listening. Enjoyable. However, unless you have the Table of Contents you aren't always able to tell what the song is. When you are a ""Mouse"" connoisseur it's annoying."
8670,1,great movie,"I live In Rutherford County and my husband worked for Damon Huskey on which the movie is based. Some of the things were a little far fetched but all in all is depicted as he lived.The Part of the movie of the 3 officers that were killed was based on actual events as it took place on that horrible evening May 31st 1979.My husband was working that day and spend hours in the woods looking for the shooter.So far this movie has only been available on VHS and would love to see it on DVD.But it is worth watching to see how a country sheriff did all that was expected of him and then some.Kind of like Buford Pusser in ""Walking tall"" but he didn't carry a big stick just a big gun."
8671,1,Classic intro to SUSY,"This book is the classic introduction to superfields. It is very elegant an formal, and appeals to the more mathematically minded particle physics student. It contains almost nothing on phenomenological applications of supersymmetry, and keeps it's hands clean by avoiding messy but important topics, such as regularization of supersymmetric gauge theories."
8674,1,She continues to blow me away,"I wish she could sign with Motown or J Records and get some of the respect she deserves. While Britney and J. Lo are making headlines, she is making music. That effortless coloratura, she does everything but the Riperton-esque notes (and Trouble was close :-) ). Maybe a hook-up with Quincy Jones or Stevie Wonder could have her become a SHINING STAR..."
8678,1,"If you liked Hitch Hiker's Guide, you'll like this","Douglas Adams, in my opinion, is really funny. He writes jokes that you have to be pretty smart to get, but not a genius. British jokes. But jokes, nonetheless. He writes strange, off-the-wall, science fiction humor. Sometimes the book can get a little too strange and make you go, ""what?"" and reread that page, but its still good. I liked it, and I hope you'll like it too."
8679,1,"Great book, but not as good as the first","I came away from this book with the feeling that it was a bit of a comedown after the first Dirk Gently book. It didn't quite deliver the same laugh-out-loud hilarity and intelligent, complex plot as the first one.Having said that, though, you still can't go very wrong by buying this book. I love all of Douglas Adams' works (yes, even the oft-maligned ""Mostly Harmless""), so for me a four-star review just means that it wasn't quite as enjoyable as many of his other books. But it's still a good read, no question about it."
8681,1,For the fans (pt. 2),"In this book we follow Dirk Gently on another crazy adventure. This is the second book in the series, the first beingDirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. I'd recommend to read the books in the correct order (I think the character introduction of Dirk Gently is better in the first book). Also, the story here seems to me to be a bit more complex than the first one.If it's your first book from this author, don't take this one. Then the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is the one you want (witch is also a series consisting of 5 books). If, after reading that, you've become a fan, then the Dirk Gently-series is definitely for you!"
8687,1,Van Damne vs Van Damne,"Againg i saw this movie on T.V,and i loved it.Van Damne plays 2 characters.I character hes a killer that kills mom thats bad to their children.His other character is a clone so he could he get the bad one for this F.B.I agent.I loved this movie.I coudnt wait at the end becuase thats when Van Damne fights Van Damne.Good fight,they should make more of these.This movie is worth watching,trust me I am like a huge Van Damne fan and when I say his movie is good,then its good."
8690,1,Excellent Product,Great product for a good price. I bought this as a gift and the receipient liked it very much. High quality stainless with solid handles and other hardware.
8697,1,Nice set,"This set was purchased for a camper, heats and distributes the temp well for a less expensive set, Farberware is a trusted name"
8703,1,Crafty humor,"Great show. These guys are committed to getting laughs. Though their method is certainly sophomoric, there's enough clever wordplay, deprecation, and pop culture reference that they're able to really get it to work."
8709,1,Princess Leia costume,Even though it is a one size fits all... It fit me pretty well! The costume was well made and the price is reasonable. It was a great buy!
8716,1,Very pleased,There product is very well made. The lid forms a tight seal. The rivets on the handles are not exposed which makes cleaning easy. My only complaint is that the handles get hot.
8718,1,3 quart saucespan,"Product was found to be as represented. functionlly good, and useable. Delivery was prompt. I bought it using the iphone 4 s , and it was a satifactory way of purchase."
8722,1,Still Relevant Today,Cabbagetown is still as relevant today as when it was written in 1950. With the same same econmic and cultural pressures in play today as during the Depression it is well worth the read.
8737,1,Fashion Forward,"David Sedaris puts things in writing that aren't discussed in polite company but ring true to everyone. And sometimes he tells polite, but amusing tales too. What insight."
8740,1,Not really 10 inches...,"Just received this today, and am mildly disappointed to find that it measures 9 1/2 inches across, not 10 inches as the box says. I had been hoping to use the heavy glass lid from my old 10 inch pan, but obviously can't. Also, the metal lid that comes with this pan does not seem to be really tight fitting - the lid isn't heavy enough to really press down and there's a bit of play - not close to a press fit & will probably let steam escape readily. Not enough reason to send this back at this price, but annoying misrepresentation. On the plus side, really nice finishing & well made."
8743,1,Farberware Fry Pan,"It is wonderful to have tracked down this ""old style"" Farberware. I bought this as a gift for someone who needed to replace hers from the 70's. Seems that they hold up pretty well. Nothing fancy, just a basic, sturdy and favorite line of cookware."
8753,1,Good Stuff!!,"If you are a long time Neal Young fan, Prairie Wind is a very cool breeze. Many of the cuts will bring back memories of Harvest and Harvest Moon. Not my favorite NY recording but certainly worth having in your collection."
8761,1,QuickShade Marketplace Screen,"This really kept the bugs out during our camping trip. It is a little hard to zip, but well worth the money!"
8766,1,An unexpected hit,"I stumbled on this one on another online movie site and based on the 4 out of 5 stars, figured I had nothing to lose but time. Turns out, it's a really good movie. Very dark Twilight Zone-esque sort of plot with mind bending twists and turns that are sure to leave you asking questions. As soon as you think you know what is happening, the plot takes another sharp turn. If you liked the original Twilight Zone, you'll definitely enjoy this one."
8770,1,Twisted like a Klein bottle,Had no expectations when I received this film.Thought it was going to be another slightly entertaining B-movie.A certain set of events moved rather fast and made me wonder a little bit.Especially the way it happened and what was said by the characters.Then a few scenes later I was flabbergasted.And after that it kept throwing out ropes of disbelief.Put me in the mind of certain sci fi films I have seen.And there is still one character who appeared near then end that I am wondering about.I have an idea of what that character may represent but it may be nothing.Surprised me with its quality.Good film.
8774,1,Liked it - Hated it,"Everybody has already said everything, so I'll just add that I'm on the fence here. I did enjoy it as a light ""read,"" but I appreciate historical accuracy and, as pointed out in a few of the reviews, history took a bit of a beating. I know a few historical writers and admire their striving after historical accuracy. It's a shame with such a rich tapestry from which to select, that Gregory played loose with the facts.On the up side, it's a fast and entertaining read. I had no problem with Anne's and Mary's dialog. I enjoy a little down-and-dirty, which is probably closer to the way people actually talked at the time and behind closed doors. The courtly speech rang true for me as well."
8779,1,Hooked on historical fiction!,"A friend recommended this book a year ago. I wasn't interested in this era before and thought it might be a romance novel. I was wrong. Excellent book. I couldn't put it down. I read it in record time and then moved onto Boleyn Inheritance, Queen's Fool and Constant Princess. I would also like to thank the publisher for the excellent Kindle price ($7.99). The White Queen is waiting in the wings. Keep up the good work, Philippa!"
8795,1,Enjoyable historical fiction from the Tudor era,"Most people have heard of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII who was infamously beheaded when she failed to bear him a son (and whose daughter, Elizabeth, went on to become a great monarch). But few are aware that prior to Anne's rise, her sister, Mary, was the King's mistress and allegedly bore him two children. This novel seamlessly blends fact and fiction to tell the story of the Boleyn family, whose ambitions and aspirations caused them to put two daughters in harm's way. However, the story centers around the rivalry between the two sisters as well as their relationship with their brother, George Boleyn, who was executed just prior to his sister. A captivating tale about this fascinating period of history."
8798,1,"Great story, not historically acurate","So the Other Boleyn Girl is really well written, as soon as you start off the book the details are great and it just draws you in like a hook, Gregory really hit the nail on the head with the story itself, I really liked her little twist on George and his irritation with girls :)Though the historical details are extremely inaccurate, but if you don't mind the historical inaccuracies then this book is for you. This book follows mary Boleyn, by the way, not anne. I got this book due to the fact that I watched the movie and thought it was about Anne, also it shows mary in a much nicer light then what she really was."
8799,1,Good,"This book arrived in a a little slower then I thought in fact had kinda forgot I order it, but since I was not in a rush it was not a huge problem. Arrived as said in good shape. Book had no wear,tears or markings."
8803,1,The Other Boleyn Girl,"Read the book in one seating. Fiction, non fiction and history all thrown together; how great."
8804,1,An Exploitation Classic,"I have decided that exploitation movies are my favorite genre. You don't have to take them seriously, and you can just enjoy their bad writing and over-the-top kick ass mentality. As for the acting, you can enjoy Shelly Winters being laughably shrill, Bernie Casey being ""cool,"" Bill McKinney as a volatile villain, and Antonio Vargas taking over the movie every time he appears. It's a shame Tamara Dobson didn't have much of a career, because as silly as her character is written, she has charisma to spare."
8805,1,The orginal.,"As the case with many other old horror films most people see the new one and think the old one's bad too, well I can say this film is far better then it's re make, it has some good jumps, and the classic message of becareful what you wish for."
8807,1,Good clean fun,Nothing like the remake - good clean fun with 3d glasses.Strange to see the guy from Adam-12 as a shifty lawyer.Funny to see the wicked witch from Wizard of Oz play the spooky housekeeper.Well written and I'm sure the special effects were good for their time.Sets are well made.My daughter loved it! - great scary movie for pre-teens.
8820,1,The best BUT gets too hot!!!,The BOPPY is the BEST although the cotton BOPPY'S are much cooler when you have your baby resting on you. This cloud BOPPY gets WAY TOO HOT. The soft velour feels nice but when you already have body heat this just adds to it.
8824,1,"Roses are red, Violets are blue","Clive Owen is just plain delightful in this movie. He doesn't play in too many comedies so be sure to catch this one. This is a very enjoyable British comedy/romance. The story centers around a convict that as a young man committed some unknown crime. When he is transferred to a prison with an eye on rehabilitation he discovers he can grow plants. After he does well with the prison garden, hortaculture becomes a sponsored work project. As they become a media draw they get political interest as well and find themselves in a quandry to do what they want and what the government and society wants. This is fun to watch and I especially recommend it to those that enjoy British comedies. Good quality DVD with great replayability. This is based on a true story and well worth owning."
8825,1,An unexpected treat,"I came across this movie and stuck with it simply because I like the actors, but was pleasantly surprised to find the plot to be quite charming as well. It's apparently based on a true story, which makes it even better, because...SPOILER there is a happy ending."
8830,1,A must read,"The noval ""Lord of the flies"" written by William Golding is one of the most complex books i have ever read. I love how this book makes you think and relate situations and characters to those in your own life. at first glance this noval may seem like its not worth reading but dont judge a book by its cover.the only reason i gave this book a 4 instead of 5 is that it diddnt seem very realistic for example: the boys age i didnt think they were old enogh to even really comprehend what they had done,also there seemed to be no remorse for death.But that is easily forgotton because of the intensity of this great book . Not only is this book entertaining and colorful but its also got a not so easily seen message.But through symbolism and getting to know the characters you will find that this book makes you see your society and yourself in a whole new way."
8831,1,A book of a very different sort!,`Lord of the Flies' is a novel written on the forces of good and evil. It tells of the gradual destruction of the human nature. I can't tell whether the book is for children or for adults. The plot of the book is simple enough but the message Golding tried to give is very serious.A group of British schoolboys gets marooned on an uninhabited island while they were being transported to a safer place during Second World War. In the course of time the boys gets split amongst themselves and form two groups. Eventually their hostile attitude turns to war.The title `Lord of the Flies' is very vague. You won't get the meaning of it till you have read the book. In fact you get to know who or what the lord of the flies is after reading more than half of the book. This is a well-written book and if you are a person who is looking for food for thought `Lord of the Flies' is highly recommended.
8837,1,Lord of the flies,This book is really good especially since at my age you can relate to some of the characters. Everyone knows a Ralph or Jack in their life. What I liked about his book is how Golding can make the island a symbol of how the world is. Also he makes symbols of all these important things so once you actually read it carefully you get the real meaning of the book which is how mankind is actually is. What I didnt like about the book was that it only had boys. It seems like if males can only survive or if they're more better than females. I would recommend this book to anyone in high school or older but mainly to high school age students since this is a book that makes you relate to all the characters in the book.
8846,1,"Intriguing Story line, plot drags a little.","This novel has an interesting view of human nature and its primal tendancies. The quality of writing and imagery is masked a little by over-usage of detail statements. The characters are complex and interesting, but the story could be told equally as effectively in 125 pages as it was in 202. In short: good book, worth buying."
8847,1,I really liked this book.,"I really liked this book. It is one of my favorites. After I read it, I had a different outlook on things."
8855,1,Shows the true nature of man vs. survival,"I just finished this book for English, and I felt it nailed its message pretty well. The symbols and deeper meanings are really an early attempt at exploring the true nature of children vs. their morals under survival situations. It is sad seeing how young boys can do this to each other, but it is very realistic in its psychological views, and shows how anyone has the ability to give into power and impulses under the right circumstances. The ending just pieces everything together, and shows the true impact the actions have caused these boys emotionally, even though it is a little anti-climatic. In the end, the basic moral is to not give in to your natural impulses so quickly and not to be quick to judge other people. It also teaches you that anyone has the ability to turn evil when given power, but there will always be those with morals who continue to fight on."
8857,1,Disturbing Tale,"I've heard a lot about The Lord of the Flies throughout my life, but this was my first time reading it. It was surprisingly short and fast;it didn't quite live up to the hype in my mind but it was still well worth a read. It certainly can be interpreted as an allegory for the base nature of man and especially of the power of 'the mob.' Overall I thought Golding's descriptions and the way he kept the narrative moving was very effective; the characters evolved from typical schoolboys into something fierce, raw and unscrupulous. However I felt that I needed more character development and background in order to really care about these characters and therefore feel fully horrified at what happens to them."
8862,1,lord of the flies-book review,I think that Golding was trying to tell his readers that there is a need for rules and civilization.I agree with Golding because if there were no rules or guidelines to abide by then people would go crazy and we would end up in total chaos.I think Golding's best literary element in Lord of the Flies was his characters he created. Each person was very different from each other. I think it could be believable because without a set of rules or regulations people would act the way the boy's acted in the book.I think the book was fine.I just would've changed some of the beginning so it wouldn't drag as much as it did.
8865,1,Lord of the Flies,"I really enjoyed William Goldings novel Lord of the Flies. It was adventurous, tragic, and very convincing. If you like novels that start off shaky with a high climax and end not happy but not sad you'll love Lord of the Flies."
8873,1,Testing Human Strength!,"This book goes into the troubles of young children trying to survive in an unknown world. As they're faced with the tasks of making shelters, and finding food they learn another problem. What if they aren't alone? This book truly tests the capabilities of children and what they can handle when alone. It forces them to learn how to fend for themselves in the scary world of today.Although I usually don't enjoy adventure or action books a lot like this type of book, I really enjoyed it. The language in which the book is written captivates the reader, and draws you into the story line. I could never stop imagining that I was one of those children faced with the troubles that they were faced with. I highly recommend this book."
8881,1,Lord of The Flies Review,"I thought this book was very interesting in many ways. It really opened my eyes to the evil nature of human beings, and how, if we let it, that evil nature will come out. When they first land on the island, the boys are all dressed in a uniform, and they are proper, as their upbringing would cause them to be. There is, however, a huge difference in their appearance and attitudes at the end of the novel. All of the boys are dressed up like savages, with paint on their bodies. None of them care at all about rules or regulations or what is right or wrong. That shows just how easily humans can turn from good to evil. I enjoyed reading Lord of The Flies because there was usually never a dull moment. In every chapter, there was always something new developing. This was a very good book."
8890,1,lord of the flies,The book is very good. It is really realistic. Tells of survival and what happens when the worse comes.
8896,1,Franklin-Green Knight,This is just another wonderful story in Franklin's life. Our two boys just love watching this DVD. It's complete and interesting to watch!! I would definitely recommend this if your child likes Franklin.
8898,1,Good Book & Price,"I was looking for books to donate to a Christmas charity, with the special offer (4 for 3) going on, these were a good deal/free shipping with prime/no tax. Better than if I went to the store. Little Critter books rarely disappoint!"
8902,1,easy enough for a child,my five year old loves it and has been playing it every day since we got it.it's not too loud.We hooked it up to an amplifier and it was louder althoughthe sound quality was still just ok. One little plastic tab broke off the lidthe first day but it still works fine and stays on. We LoVE it.
8904,1,Good,"I previously bought one, that messed up within a week of me playing it. The clamp that holds the arm bar in place broke as I was snapping it in place, and the records started sounding like chimpmunks. So Numark replaced it within a week, and the one I have now works fine. I'd heard excellent reviews from [...] so I definitely wanted to give it another shot. I know this is their cheapest and most low budget player. I'm just getting started with vinyl, and am pretty excited to play a lot more records. And if I ever wanted to preview the records at the store, it just needs batteries."
8914,1,A glimpse of medieval life.,The Pig Plantagenet is a fantasy which gives the reader entertainment and a view of European medieval rural life. This book is along the lines of Watership Down and The Sword in the Stone.
8917,1,Nice small classic knife,"If your looking for small pocket knife with classic styling, look no further. Holds a great edge, good folding action.Happy with the purchase!"
8923,1,From Jonathans daugter ally,Hello...My name is ally crane and i am Jonathan crane daughter!This book is a great book if you want to know about social programs that work and things like that!It is very well written and gives the reader a lot of info. So if you want a book about it then DO get this book! P.S. it is dedicated to me...lol!My real name is alyssa!
8927,1,Parker beyond Spencer,"It is almost too easy to settle into Robert Parker's Spencer novels - a stolid, principled, tough and totally self sufficient PI with plenty of action and even some insight into the human condition. Not, however, particularly real. The surprisingly, pleasingly, first person feminine perspective has allowed Parker to explode the shell of imperviousness of Spencer's and seems to have liberated him to discuss the true nature of the common struggle. People live with contridictions and compromises and there is no such thing as the clear path to happiness. His protagonist ""Sunny"" is so much more complex and real than Spencer (tho I love Spencer and Hawk dearly). Sunny is imperfect, physically unimposing, non-self-sufficient and a completely captivating and exciting protagonist. ""Life is a bitch, and you work around it."" Classic Parker - but sharper, closer to home. A great read and a step forward for one of my favorite authors."
8931,1,"Great Reading, Fast Action","This book was a fun summer book. The plot was quick and the action was fast pace. Finally a woman who is self- confident and entertaining.I like the idea that she had a little dog, and that she did not feel that she or any woman needed a man to complete her.I look forward to morebooks starting Sunny Randall."
8945,1,works well on the proper shoe,"A great product, but you need to put it on the proper shoe. If you use it on shoes with a closed toed, your toes can no longer fit comfortably inside as this product is considerably thick. It works best with shoes that have lots of toe wiggle room, such as heeled sandals. I put it on my sandals that have a very well-worn toe bed, and it's extended the lifetime of my well used shoes. Make sure to clean your shoe and let it dry before apply the product (such as with a bacteria killing surface cleansing wipe), and it should help it stick better. I haven't had any problems with it peeling off."
8948,1,fan of alternate endings and alike.,"this books was pretty good, it certainly filled the need i felt. some of the characters situations are a little boring and are not developed to well. but the story is great, when i read it i look at it like a modern day army fighting a wwII army. technology of the lizards is about what our technology is now, so that make's it interesting. it's not the best he could have made it but it is definitely worth reading, it can become addictive which is good, i recommend it."
8958,1,Friends or Foes?,I enjoyed this novel thoroughly and think it is the best of Glenn Meade's books. Three old friends amidst the exotic setting of Egypt are plunged into the geopolitical reality of pivotal World War II events (and not necessarily on the same side). The strength of this novel are its characters. The story line does not slow down at all throughout. The exciting audio abridgement of this novel is worth a listen as well.
8959,1,Very entertaining and convincing,"The first Glenn Meade book that I read was Brandenburg. It was an unbelievable, fascinating but film-like story. However The Sands of the Sakkara has a more convincing plot, well described settings and powerful surprises that leave you with your mouth open. At some point the reader might think the story is predictable but the desperation and emotions of the characters will amaze you. The sentence ""In a stunning story that reaches from the teeming streets of Berlin to the feet of the great pyramids, three former friends are about to meet again: around a mission to assassinate FDR,"" grabbed my attention and convinced me to read this book. Can you imagine if Germany had won the war? Well, read this book and find out ""how close Germany came to winning the war."""
8963,1,VW by Bentley,It has pretty good info. for the do it yourselfer. I saw that everyone suggested this book and so do I.
8974,1,A very pleasant read,This is the perfect book for a quiet interlude on the couch. You will enjoy it from beginning to end
8977,1,Inspiring,"Unlike most sreenwriting books, this one seems to speak directly to the reader and keep their interst by influencing the writer to keep on writing instead of discouraging them with reality checks like most writers tend to do. Viki King has the abiltiy to inspire the writer in all of us helping them to work through the road blocks."
8978,1,Just started but so far so good,"It has really given me alot of good tips so far but unfortunately I have just started the book, I still have lots more to go but so far it has helped me alot in my imagination and writing and helped me see things differently than the dirrection I was going, I recomend this book, it is good."
8979,1,Worked for Me!,"This is a gimmick book with substance, if such a thing is possible.At the risk of sounding like a cheesey testimonial, I want to say that I bought the book, read it, followed the simple advice she offered and the result was a finished screenplay.Viki King understands all the things that prevent people who want to write from doing so. She can chase away all the negative thoughts that cloud a writer's mind. I also appreciated the way she assures you that quitting your job and selling all you own will not make it any easier to finish something if you are not in the right frame of mind.Have I sold my screenplay? No. But the satisfaction I got in finally finishing one was worth the price of the book and then some."
8981,1,"Yes, Bluegills are easy to catch...","The focus of the book is also where the large bluegills live. Weather and season wise is also taken into account. I have caught nice fish on flys and on string and safety pins as a kid. I want a trophy and dinner. Yes, I will let the trophy go after the photos. Buy it..."
8983,1,Problem with DOLBY TrueHD!,"I played the disc on 2D bluray.My receiver ( Denon 4310 ) support the DOLBY TrueHD, but unfortunately theDOLBY TrueHD ""stage"" & ""Audiance"" on the disc were recognized ""only"" as Dolby Digital.Nevertheless, the sound was great.Interview of 60 minutes( bonus video )is too long.Extending the paying duration is preferred.bottom line - BUY IT!!!"
8984,1,100 compelling reasons to keep getting up in the morning,"Steve Chandler is an insistent, unabashed optimist, in the same vein as Norman Vincent Peale. He covers 100 motivational tips that stretch the imagination, factor in the impact of technology, and challenge you to evaluate your situation from different points of view. The choices you make can either motivate you or hinder you, so he provides a wide array of tips you can embrace, reject, or simply read and digest. You can implement the games and exercises to make working toward your dream goal more fun. Though much of the content is basic and available in other self-help books, we recommend this breezy paperback; you can carry it in your briefcase and open it up randomly if you're feeling low and want to get rejuvenated and motivated."
8989,1,Sold down the River,I am interested in history of the old south and there were many different characters in the book that held my interest.
8990,1,"Good video, Great Gift for new Parents","This video is an excellant video for new Moms and Dads, and in addition for anyone who will be helping with the newborn, to give Mom and Dad a break. The only drawback I found with the video was the length of the video. I wished it had gone into more detail , most specifically caring for the crying baby, and also, care of the baby up to 6 months. However, I can find no fault in this being a beginners tool for learning, and also, a refresher for us who have not taken care of an infant in many years. I purchased this video for first time parents. I wanted to watch it before giving it to make sure it would be something I would be glad to give as a present. I am glad and the parents were very happy to receive. See visually is great because reading is good but for those who are visual people, the instructions from this video will be more helpful. A great gift idea."
8994,1,"Overall, I liked Rembrandt toothpaste. The only thing ...","Overall, I liked Rembrandt toothpaste. The only thing I didn't like about it is that there's no fluoride in the toothpaste. I also didn't get a fresh taste in my mouth after using it, although my teeth seemed whiter. I'd recommend it for whitening purposes."
8998,1,A brief glimpse of Chinese philosophy.,"Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China is a book that opens the door to Chinese philosophy. Some of the writing may be familiar, such as Confucius while other lagalist writing sounds more Machiavellian. A good book for an introduction to Chinese philosophy, much of it reads like poetry."
9001,1,Electronic 50...,"I love the book that comes with it. I tried one of those mail order courses, and it nearly crushed my love of electronics. I didn't try and for a while. I decided to try it with smaller kits instead. This starts off like that course did, and I seem to remember something from it. This is far better though. I'm nervous about trying to start soldering. This kit doesn't include soldering (that I know of anyway). The durability is horrible though. It should be on a sturdier frame, and a better battery holder."
9008,1,High Mystery with some Cool Magic,"I really enjoyed the ""cast"" of the book, mainly the ""crew"" with the super-old guy as the fighter of evil with the help of the very smart and Agatha-Christie-like heroine. She's the kind of young woman you want at your side, really a role model as a great friend, and she ends up helping strangers. I think this is a good scifi/paranormal read for any age. I was amazed at her organizational skills (decidedly usually reserved for male roles) and tenacious adherence to solving the mystery. If you like Poirot, Murder She Wrote, and X-Files, you will love this book"
9009,1,Fun fantasy style imitator of Janet Evanovich,"The show must go on. Least that has been the performer's credo, but when magician's assistants start disappearing--yes, almost on a nightly basis--Esther Diamond skips out on doing the 'disappearing act' in her current production. Instead she goes to work with 300 plus year old sorcerer, Max Zadok, to try and find who is making these women disappear. As the incidences pile up, Esther and Zadok acquire quite a team of helpers, including a crew of transvestites, a cowboy and a socialite magician. While this does make for a varied and interesting cast, there are far too many toss-off lines and too much repetitive dialogue. For those of you who have read Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels, ""Disappearing Nightly"" is definitely a pale copy. If you are into fantasy, go ahead and read the book, but add Evanovich if you want some truly hilarious mystery stories."
9016,1,a great documentary,"as a true sex pistols fan, i really enjoyed that movie when i first saw it at the movies. But, there there is one thing that could've make it better. All the songs are pasted on the performances from Nevermind the Bollocks except a few ones. The original sound must've been in really bad shape if Temple had to do that. But frankly, that's all that's negative about it, the rest is very good and any sex pistols fan with self-esteem must see this, trust me."
9020,1,"Old Robbery, Tribal Policeman Dead","Tony Hillerman's HUNTIN BADGER has Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee investigating an old robbery that resulted in the death of a tribal policeman. The FBI screwed up and a murderer escaped into the desert and mountains leaving a question of why did one of the robbers kill himself?Chee called in from a vacation discover a gap in the theory of the FBI investigation and Leaphorn joins him at the request of an old friend.Excellent plot with plenty of twists like the fantastic canyons of the Southwest.Nash Black, author of HAINTS."
9023,1,Another Hit From Hillerman,"Tony Hillerman has written another engaging Chee/Leaphorn mystery, and although it's not my favorite work of the series, Hunting Badger is an excellent read. As far as contemporary mystery writing is concerned Hillerman is one of the best. The continuing evolution of his main characters is as interesting as the plot. With each book we get to know new sides of Jim Chee and the Legendary Lieutenant Leaphorn who had always been somewhat aloof until his wife's death and his retirement. It's nice to see him tread new ground after all these years. As always Hillerman is extremely adept at evoking the beautiful landscape of the Four Corners region, which regular readers have come to know and love. Within the mystery genre you're not likely to find a better sustained series, and Hunting Badger, if not the best in the series, nicely continues the tradition."
9038,1,Fiend shows why he's one of the more talented soldiers,"On his sophomore album, Fiend mixes things up a little, most notably including only four guest appearances, as opposed to the fifty or so on his last album. On ""Ak'n Bad,"" over a grimy beat, Mystikal steals the show with the fast paced stutter-stop flow he's mastered. ""Heart Of A Ghetto Boy"" is a subdued track on which Fiend slows his flow to match the sax in the background. The track is a welcome break from the rowdiness of the first six tracks. On ""Walk That Line,"" he totally flips his flow. You gotta listen to it more than once to fully appreciate it. Other standout tracks include ""The Rock Show,"" ""Trip To London,"" and ""Waiting On God.""The album could've done without songs like ""The Truth Is"" and ""They Don't Hear Me,"" as they don't bring anything new to the table. But overall, ""Street Life"" is one of the better No Limit releases of recent memory."
9041,1,Classic,"I can't say much that other reviewers haven't already said. This is a sweet, charming movie with talking farm animals and a decent story. The characters of the animals are pulled off nicely, and if you enjoy films with talking animals, then give this a try!"
9043,1,good but not his best,"Although written in the 1940s, and using an unusual ""in the army"" scenario, this Nero Wolfe mystery still holds up well, not nearly as dated as you would assume. As always, Wolfe's sidekick, Archie Goodwin, supplies plenty of irreverence and laughs ... and he always gets the girl. Not the strongest in the Nero Wolfe series, but still a thoroughly enjoyable read."
9048,1,Good stuff even with musicians edited out!,"Great music from Jimi and the boys.One thing-I distinctly remember a Mitch Mitchell drum solo.Furthermore, where is that other guitar player?And the congas or bongos (or whatever-can't be sure)?Why try and remake history?Sheesh...music biz people-can't leave well alone.Nevertheless,a must for serious Hendrix fans and collectors."
9053,1,False motives,"This Agatha Christie novel has a deliciously complex plot with the usual twists and turns which are uncovered by the inimitable Hercule Poirot. A young woman named Rosaleen has married a man named Underway. Upon Underway's death, Rosaleen remarries a wealthy man named Gordon Cloade. He dies two weeks after the marriage, which makes Rosaleen a very wealthy widow indeed. She and her brother come to take over Cloade's home and fortune, much to the dismay of Cloade's family who have lost a fortune to her. Soon a man comes to town and claims that Rosaleen's first husband, Underway, is not dead, meaning Rosaleen is still married to him and so should not inherit Cloade's fortune. People begin to die and one of the Cloade men asks for Hercule Poirot's help in solving the mystery. Poirot interviews the people involved, gets his little gray cells working and puts together the puzzle to solve the murders. This is another wonderful book by the world's most famous mystery author."
9080,1,Well worth the money,"I have a Motorola E815 phone approaching 4 years old and the original battery was only lasting about a day. I had heard that a new battery would cost me about the re-up price for a new phone from Verizon. Since my life is quite transitional now, I really didn't know what phone I wanted or needed, hence when I found this battery for less than $10 delivered I thought it was worth the shot. I think I ordered it on Friday and it was in the mail Monday, much faster than I expected. The battery and the new back still fits within my leather case, and it gives probably four days with moderate use. More usage cuts it down, but I still get a couple of days before it needs to be recharged."
9085,1,"excellent, but there's a catch","The 5 video set, ""Building Big"" with David Macaulay is an excellent overview of human's accomplishments in building. If you appreciate architecture, and especially if you are endeavoring to raise a youngster's awareness of this art form, this video set is something you'll want to own so that you can keep going back to it periodically. It explains in clear and vibrant terms how and why our structures are made the way they are. The catch is the 6th video - which is what is meant by ""educational curriculum"". At the end of each of the original 5 videos in this set, there is a section for children with activities for you to build small scale examples (bridges, domes, tunnels, dams and skyscrapers) to learn in a hands-on way the principles involved. The 6th video is simply a repeat of this material. The 6th video - ""Building Big and Thinking Small"" should be sold separately."
9090,1,a good enough shave,they do the trick. i cant believe razor blades in general are so expensive but this package is not a bad deal. i use each blade about 15 times before i replace them although they do dull out after about 8. but i am a very frugal and poor person so i cannot afford to replace them like a prince. overall though a good value.
9097,1,For 'Die-hard fans' only --also beware in PAL not NTSC.,"I purchased this tape in Nov.2000.At first I was disappointed because the copy sent to me was in PAL format , then I purchased a multi-format VHS VCR so that I could exchange tapes with relatives abroad.The seuences 'echo' a favored time . Not particularly interesting musically but a historical 'gem'.I transferred it to NTSC format; then the soundtrack to Cassette & CD (with 'Synthesized stereo/Surround' sound ,as the tape is Monophonic). Recently I've made a DVD+R transfer ,since a 'commercial' release isn't available. Good stuff - for fans!!Edd.iegolden@shaw.ca"
9098,1,Good book!,"Although this book does point out some amusing inconsistencies and changes between episodes, some are a bit TOO ""nit-picky."" For instance, who cares why Mulder & Scully don't use flashlights in certain instances? Anyway, I love the plot summaries and other factoids the book gives."
9104,1,Roberto Deveraux a different view of Queen Elizabeth,"Roberto Deveraux presents England's Queen Elizabeth I in a different light than most English history books. The opera, written by Donizetti an Italian composer, portrays her as a woman starving for love and jealous for one man she thinks could love her. Beverly Sills presents a magnificent projection of her in this image. Her role is clearly a colorotura role and her voice, particularly in the closing aria, magnificently projects a woman lamenting her life. This opera is rarely performed in the US and I think this is so because of the plot rather than the music. A good buy and a good watch."
9115,1,Garmin Aviation GPS Serial Data cord for PC interface,"This cable fits the 296/396/496 series of Garmin Aviation hand-held GPS units. It allows one to interface the GPS unit with the MS Flight-Sim program (using the GPSOut software - Google to find the software). If your computer does not have a serial connection, you need to also purchase the serial to USB cable. So far the cable has peformed without problem and the delivery was on time.DKM"
9121,1,well it works,"the bouncer looks and works like it says... the only problem is that my son hates it! he screams the minute hes put in there, but is happy to be bounced on my knee for what seems like 23 hours a day. i probably will sell it to someone because for me, it just takes up room!"
9122,1,Excellent plug and play product,"This product delivered as promised. Easy installation and provided me with everything I needed. Speeds, where my vehicles had stopped for extended breaks, and what routes were being taken. Fantastic tool!"
9124,1,MacArthur,"This movie is well-made, and presented well. I had no personal liking for General MacArthur, and my feelings were enhanced by the presentation of his super-ego overiding vast military experience."
9125,1,Good Movie,Even though this is an older movie it shows how determination and sticking to principles can win the day. The product arrived on time and in good condition.
9128,1,NCIS 3rd season,I was very glad to find the third season on here because i have all the other seasons but could never find this one. It is very good and excellent to watch clear and good ty Faye
9140,1,Welcome back to Country,"I originally bought this album because I was going to see Matt in concert & wanted to know what I was in for. I was surprised to find the album was truly pure country - not the pop version of what radio thinks country should be. I was further hooked when I got to meet Matt after the concert. He is one of the truest people I have ever met. He writes about what he knows & isn't ashamed to admit he's made mistakes. It floored me to learn that he had been told he was ""too country"" for country radio. A pity. It's hard to find that lilting twang in the vocals & that soul-piercing cry of the fiddle & steel guitar on the radio. If you like classic country, you will love this album."
9145,1,Building Valve Amp,It is a good book directed to beginners. You will find there many advices on how to plan an amp lay out and hints on metal working.Don't expect to find there math based circuit analysis for the advanced experimenter.
9147,1,Sturdy but breakable.,"Comes with a nice grip, excellent for just screwing around. However they have begun to split and one did fully crack. Nothing a little duct tape couldn't fix :) I have owned these a little less than a year."
9148,1,Better than expected.,Great quality for a great price! The swords came well packaged and are still in good condition. They are heavy wood and not for small children.
9149,1,My son loves them :),"These swords look very nice. My husband thinks the hand guards look a little cheap, but my son is only using these for practice, not actual contact, so he won't be using the guards. Great swords for the price. Thank you :)"
9153,1,Classic Nastie!,"""Spit"" is one of my all time favourite little ""nasties"".It's sick alright and still very disturbing, even though it was made way back in 1978. Ok, it's low, low budget, but that's why it works.The film's lack of music throughout makes it all the more off putting.Camille Keaton, as the victim, is an absolute trouper.Rodney, is Gold.This Millennium Edition of ""Spit"" is something my brother and I used to joke about. Ever since we first caught ""Spit"" at the Drive In on it's original release, the idea of a special edition of ""Spit"" was something we only ever dreamt of one day owning.To have it like this, THX Certified Transfer, Dolby Digital/DTS 5.1, looking and sounding like it was made yesterday, with extras laid on, you've got to be kidding.And that cover ain't half bad either....hey?Warning:Definately not for the kiddies."
9167,1,Excellent quality.,This item was exactly as advertised. It arrived on time andnon great condition.Not the best price I have seen but excellent quality makes up for it.
9168,1,An album the is warm and pesonal,"Clair Marlo's Behaviour Self is a collection of warm, well done songs. The quality of the recording makes it feel that she is giving a personal performance in the same room. This is not to say that her music is the standard ""coffee club performer with a guitar."" Her music takes you to many different places. You stroll through the French countryside with the accordion laden ""To Close,"" and you feel like you are in the midst of a gospel choir in ""Break the Chain."" If you are looking for a quaint, light and relaxing set of music, Behaviour Self is not a bad choice."
9192,1,shopping experience,"The merchant delivered the correct product as presented to me by Amazon within the expected time. The packaging met with expectations. To summarize, this was a good shopping experience, but not exceptional: specifically, package shipment speed was ""within expectations"" and not faster than expected without additional expedited shipping expenses. A few rare vendors have presented me this kind of experience, and it therefore became necessary on my part to reserve five stars only for that level of service.My only disappointment -- and that is a personal matter, not as a result of any failing of the vendor -- is that the ink itself is not as black as I might like. If I cannot get absolutely black than I'd rather use blue ... a mild black is unappealing to me."
9210,1,Nostalgia for the right price,"I was 10 when I saw the movie the first time in the theaters. I relived that experience when I bought this DVD. It is full screen, not letterbox or widescreen. Sound is crisp and clear with full bass response. Video is sharp and colorful. Arcee looks better than ever. Special features are lacking (no trailers) but it still rocks just the same!"
9211,1,Good '80s action cartoon,The movie is a classic as the animated cartoons in the mid eighties that I follow every day.The Autobots led by Optimus Prime must fight the evil Decepticons led by Megatron in a battle that is stablished on Earth after the Decepticons forces Autobots to travel across space from their home planet Cybertron to Earth.This long feature is quite different from the episodes that I saw in Spain.There's violence in form that the leader of Autobots is killed by Megatron and after its succesor which makes me cry when I see it.The plot is good with good f/x.Good dvd.
9217,1,Great Movie! Get it!,A great movie. Sure... some things go unexplained and are out right funny... but hey... optimus prime and megatron fight to the death!
9219,1,Transformers,"Robots Die. Robots get eaten.Big Demon looking Robot. Great Movie. Buy it, if you like The Transformers."
9221,1,Camp-Fest ala Mae,"I'm amazed this many other people have seen this movie! I loved it! Mae in glorious technicolor reviving Diamond Lil is fantastic! The entire movie is hilarious, probably not in the way that Mae intended, but I'm sure she's happy to get a laugh. And the fact she did this at 85 is astounding. This is also the only movie you see her drink alcohol in."
9226,1,good but sometimes maudlin,"I've always loved this movie for the action, the well-written science fiction, and the father-son love, but the last time I watched it I became aware of way too much slow-moving emotional crap that detracts from the overall impact of an otherwise excellent film."
9233,1,A good encyclopedia,"Silver has kept targeting the young audience since her first books. However that does not mean the information is childish or in any way bad. In fact in this huge book which becomes biggeer with her smaller print she has packed in TONS of information. If you can look past the silly teen anecdotes and mama silver type stuff you'll find a book filled with valuble info. I own this book and while I wouldn't say it's a must have, it's definitely taught me a lot that's missing from other 101 books"
9240,1,Fun but not too Fun,"I have 4 kids, ages 7 1/2, 6, 4 1/2 and 2. We couldn't wait to get and play the game based on reviews we had seen. It is a matching and memory game which is fun but the pieces are very small and can be difficult for little fingers to handle and my older ones bored of it after two games, each of which lasted about 10 minutes. It's fun for a short attention span but not one we grab on a rainy afternoon."
9241,1,A Fairly Soft Piece of Work,"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"
9265,1,where are you,this what happens when kids have no parents to raise them . all parents should see this if they have the guts
9266,1,don't listen to those people!,"look were the other reviewers are coming from they don't know what inner city life is like if you want to know, watch the film it's true stories of big city life."
9267,1,Great movie?,"This movie was pretty good, though there is a lot of sex, drugs, drinking, violence etc... I'm from NYC and some ppl i know are like that i think it shows what teen life is like for some ppl in NY. I loved how they used Washington Sq. Park-a lot of ppl that are like the charaters in the movie go to that park for the same reasons... skateboard, pick fights, do drugs etc.... This movie seemed so real and i hope there would be more movies like this. -14"
9271,1,Real life Movie!!!,I watched this movie years ago and thought it would be best to purchase it. This movie is a wake up call for parents and young adults. There is a lot of vulgar language used in this movie but when you understand what the movie is all about then you will see why the language is used. If you are not from a urban city then you will not be able to understand the mindset behind this movie. This movie is not for kids despite the title of the movie.
9277,1,Interesting peek into a group of kid's lives,"I think that this movie was interesting on the basis of that this is what some kids, not all by any means, but some, go through everyday. I think that this movie is very accurate in portraying the lives of these few select ""kids"" with adult issues and problems.I highly recomend this movie"
9290,1,The Reference Shelf BIOTECHNOLOGY -- ed. by Lynn Messina,"This is an excellent selection of twenty-five recent articles, mostly from the popular press, dealing with the implications of cloning and other rapidly-expanding biotechnologies. Topics include: the human genome project, genetic testing, cloning, gene therapy, bio-engineering, human-computer interfaces, life-span modification, organ transplantation, genetically modified crop plants and farm animals; a number of controversial viewpoints are explored. An interesting bibliography is also included along with synopses of a number of related articles. Most of the articles in the book date from the last two years."
9292,1,"Good Victorian book, well written, good characterization","Emma was a very well written book in the Victorian era. Jane Austen did a wounderful job portaying the life of a welathy woman in this era. I enjoyed reading this book because it went from Emma being ""young"" and childish to her being more mature, and eventually falling in love."
9293,1,Reads a lot like the plot of the movie Clueless,"Too many similiarities between this book and the much better Alicia Silverstone movie Clueless for me to recommend it to everyone but all in all if you like your teen comedies set in Victorian england and not LA, go for it. Grab it before Hollywood discovers the similarities and gets it yanked off the shelf with a court order. Maybe Austen can write her next one based on the plot of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Set it South Africa during the Boar war or something"
9294,1,Emma,"A classic gem done full justice by the superb reading of Prunella Scales. A great listening experience was marred, however, by a surprising and disappointing flaw in disc 8 which rendered the final track unintelligible.It would be much appreciated if you could replace this faulty disc, as such a literary masterpiece deserves to be presented and preserved in mint condition.The damaged disc apart, Jane Austen would surely applaud this excellent rendition of her beloved Emma."
9295,1,Great Book.,"Emma is another one of Jane Austen's novels. It's a good book, however I don't believe it's as good as Pride and Prejudice. The protagonist, Emma, is a very bright and handsome young lady. It seems that the protagonists of Jane Austen are always female, intelligent, and pretty. The characters in this book are complex. For example, an elderly well-known bachelor suddenly falls in love and took a wife of about the same age as he. His reason for marrying is also strange, because he simply wanted to have a wife. And Emma was the person who started and encouraged their relationship. The plot was interesting too, a few surprises here and there.My problem with Emma is that it wasn't as engrossing a story as Pride and Prejudice. But this is a different style of book, so it's really unfair for me to say that Emma is not as good as Pride and Prejudice. Other than that, it's a wonderful book.I recommend it to readers who want dialogue-based novels."
9298,1,Love,"I love Jane Austen as much as the next girl & I was so excited to read Emma. However, the style is sometimes a bit difficult to get around!"
9300,1,Exhasperatingly delightful!,"Though exhasperating at times, Emma enchants us all. It is through Emma's repeated blunders,imprudence, and vanity that she becomes one of the most charming heroines of all times. Jane Austen has created a hilarious set of characters: the preposterously overprotective father, the poor chatterbox neighbour, the pretty, lighthearted protegé, and the man of reason whose love finally dictates against his logic (to name a very few). Although the plot is at times made dreary by Miss Bates' prolongued monologues, the novel is otherwise a light read. One must not expect to turn the last page having learnt some universal truth, but rather having enjoyed a few good laughs, some heart-leaping, and a few sighs. Emma is an outstanding proof of Jane Audten's wit; the candour and modesty in her novel make it a truly refreshing read."
9303,1,Emma,"Emma is probably me favorite book by Jane Austin. I do not want to give away anything, but you must get to know this wonderful girl."
9306,1,rating,"always enjoy a good jane austen for a quick, easy and wholesome read. i just wanted to rate it. done"
9308,1,Austen's novel is a timeless classic.,"Jane Austen's novel Emma is the story of a young woman who at first seems to be self-indulgent and egotistical. As the novel progresses, however, the reader finds the girl more than willing to postpone her own ambitions for romance in order to further the happiness of others. The book takes an ironic turn when Emma finds love with Mr. Knightley despite the fact that the entire novel focuses on her matchmaking efforts for others. Overall, I find this book to be a light-hearted love story and a refreshing change from many serious novels of the Victorian period."
9317,1,decent sequel,"The first Rescuers was a really good film, and this one is not QUITE as good, but it is sitll a pretty good sequel with an enjoyable story that is set in Australia with a convincing villain."
9319,1,Vintage Teletubbies!,Great episodes and fun stories! Don't miss this title if you are a collector or a fan. Very sweet message wrapped up in classic Teletubbie cuteness.
9330,1,A series that just gets better and better,"Warriors #1 Into the Wild is a great book. It's about this cat called Rusty that is owned by humans. He always dreams about catching mice in the forest. One day he goes out into the forest and runs into these forest cats. Then he decides to become a forest cat himself. A lot of older readers with he age 12 & up will think this book sounds stupid because of this review but it's now my favorite series of books. The first 2 books are confusing for everyone who who reads them. If you start wanting to quit the series because of these reasons, DO NOT QUIT! I just started Warriors #4 Power of Three and I'm soooooo addicted. If this review helps you, please respond."
9331,1,The first cat book,"The author, Erin Hunter, has created a nice cat adventure and action series by creating out a forest-river- world in which cats have their own system of governance and with specific tasks in the society. The cats here act like cats and they do what cats do. These cats live in clans and each clan has a dedicated area in their small world in which each cat is restricted to live. There are wars and fights, of course, because the leaders of the clans die and there are power mongers who want better living areas than what they currently have.Hunter has created a leader and a medicine cat for each clan, who heals and rubs natural herbs into wounds.You can clearly see that the author loves cats and has studied them and how they act.This first book Into the Wild tells how a simple house cat Rusty decides to join the Thunderclan and become a member of the clan, and a warrior."
9339,1,listen to it twice,"For those of you who are lifelong BHT fans, the songs on this CD should make you finally aware just how much of a lyricist and composer Todd Park Mohr is. Listen to these songs twice before you judge and the second time follow the lyrics. You'll be impressed how soulful and expressive he can be. Anyone who cannot be transported to another place with ""Imaginary Ships"" and especially ""ICU in Everything"" is missing so much. Relationships are the events of life which cause us all pain and pleasure at some point and these songs speak to me of both."
9340,1,"A very , very good movie","In this very good non fictional movie , the famous writer William Gibson talks all about cyberpunk,a literary genre that is something like dark science fiction .In this movie Gibson also explains thinks like ""cyberspace"" and ""virtual reality"" . The movie is well done and good for all people who want to know more about tecnology and how will be the live and the internet in the future ."
9346,1,it is what it is,"It was exactly what I ordered, no surprises. Black paper pocket folders with fasteners. It's what I needed and it's what I got!"
9351,1,Exactly what I needed!,"I bought the CycleOps Stackable Climbing Block for Indoor Bicycle Trainers to go with the Bell Motivator Mag Indoor Bicycle Trainer. I needed the block in order to keep the bike stable and level it when I set up the trainer. The CycleOps is simple to use, requires no tools, and is just the right accessory for the trainer. I don't need to do a climbing workout, but if I did, it would be necessary to buy a second CycleOps and stack it on the first one, since the CycleOps only permits one height for the bike. (This isn't clear from the product descriptions. I only learned it when I read the instructions.)"
9355,1,Not Your Average Punk Band,"Mest may just seem like another one of the power punk groups that have come about in the last couple years, but they really have their own style that they bring which helps set them apart from other bands of this nature. The catchy pop-punk 4-some has released a new album ""Destination Unknown"". This is the southside Chicago punkers 3rd album. The variations of melodic punk songs makes the albums so significant. With their first single ""Cadillac"", rawked the air ways in philly and all over the u.s. The album includes singles such as ""Cadillac"" and ""Mother's Prayer"". Out of 5 Stars, The album is a over all 4 out of 5."
9359,1,Mest has done it again,"With their newest release,""Destination Unknown,"" Mest has truely made a name for themselves in the music business. This CD is chock full of fourteen songs of a great punk vibe, clocking in at 41:46. Its uplifting beats and tempo will have you hooked the first time you listen. Unlike many other CD's,""Destination Unknown,"" doesn't require you to skip any dull or useless songs. Each song is individually composed and filled with meaningful lyrics that everyone could relate to. This CD combines a unique twist of heart-felt lyrics and a punk rock beat that you can't get enough of. Although new to the music world with only their second release, Mest has demonstrated their potential to succeed in the future."
9360,1,Good cd . band worth your ears :),"im shamed to live in florida cause of the user below .. god , i hate florida ..anyhow , mest has always been very good and i know these guys have talent . i know people who went to their shows live . the cd is full of energy and great lyrics . the songs are only a carbon copy when you search for millions of singers and find out they may have the same influences . god guys , use your brain ."
9372,1,Good solid advice,"Excellent primer for new business and reference for those a few years in. I found it covered most topics of interest except state taxes, which in the DC/MD/VA area is still a mystery to me."
9374,1,My kid is ok with it but prefers Kids Favorite Songs,When we got Kids Favorite Songs my 18 month old wanted to watch it over and over and over and though he doesn't talk yet he could easily hum most of the songs and we felt we had to get Kids Favorite songs 2 but he isn't as enthusiastic about it as the first. It's a little advanced for his age maybe he will grow into it but for younger kids the first definitely much better and easier to sing along too.
9393,1,Learn by deconstruction,(contributor) Working with flash native files that were created by professional animators and reading how they were done is a great way to learn tips and tricks. The books layout and design is the best I've seen on the market.
9394,1,A Good Way to Remember or to Experience for the First Time,"I really enjoyed this book. It adds even more personal insight to the already personal stories of Brokaw's first book. I myself, enjoyed the tales of struggle on the home from and on bonds formed to be slightly more interesting then tales of battle, but I guess that is open to interpretation. The best way to read this book is while listening to music of the time and putting yourself in the shoes of those involved."
9397,1,Hillarious,"You guys really need to get a sense of humor here. Yes, it is childish, yes it is adolescent and yes it is very stupid but there are parts that are damn funny. I really liked this movie and you have to watch it like you are viewing the absurd which you are. This movie is for people that like parodies of other movies taking it to the extreme. I recommend this movie to anyone that has a sense of humor for the absurd. So, put a smile on, sit back and laugh. It won't crack your face."
9403,1,Milano Fashion 2,I loved this CD though not overly fussed on the After party Disc 2 but otherwise it's great music to chill out with.
9408,1,Great Christmas Gift,"Bought 3 for grandkids for Christmas, to get them ready for a Family camping trip to Assateague Island in May."
9411,1,A delightful story,"This account of what life may have been like in the Garden of Eden is based on the book of Genesis. It links dragons with dinosaurs while recounting the story of Adam and Eve. Christian parents (homeschoolers, especially) will enjoy sharing this book with their children. In the book that we have there is a CD Rom included. It includes the song ""When Dragons Heart's Were Good"" and also a reading of the story by the author. The illustrations are bright and colorful and will appeal to the young children that this book is geared toward. You need this book!"
9412,1,Good product for the price !,"The mouse pad is pretty smooth, the thickness is about right.I bought the black pad, make sure you read the description before you order, to make sure you are getting the color you want."
9415,1,Real life sexual tension on screen...,Grant and Loren are terrific together. It was during the making of this film that Cary Grant fell hopelessly with Sofia Loren. Grant is his usual charming self and he pours on the charm for her...and us. This is a must-have for Cary Grant film collectors. This is a fun memorable romantic comedy.
9421,1,Gift for brother,"This was a gift for my little brother. It is still in its plastic case and was really a good quality action figure. I love Bossk from Empire Strikes back, this series of figures is a must for any collector or kid."
9423,1,Good Product - Stains can be dealt with,"I also found this to be a good product and also originally found it to stain any fabric it came in contact with. However, when I contacted Pjur Customer Service, they suggested I try OxiClean or a similar formulation. That did in fact get out the stains."
9426,1,Tante,"Anne Douglas Sedgwick, although born in New Jersey, spent her entire life after the age of nine in England, and many of her novels have an English setting. This novel is about a selfish, egomaniacal concert pianist (Tante) who almost ruins the life of her doting adopted daughter (Karen). Karen marries Gregory Jardine, and Jardine and Tante grow to hate each other; Karen, out of her blind devotion to Tante, leaves Jardine. Later Tante reveals her true tyranical colors to Karen, and Karen is able to break with her and save herself (and return to Jardine). Sedgwick was an excellent writer (Henry James admired her work), and this novel is exciting and skillfully written - even though some of the antics are a bit overheated in a melodramatic, soap-operish way. Mrs. Talcott, an American in the novel (and a real ray of light in a darkly tempestuous setting), sees through everybody and makes it all come out right in her practical, sensible manner. Well done!"
9429,1,It's a cook book!,"Airplane! is back - only this time on space shuttle! It's a bit of a re-hash of the first Airplane! movie. Still there are plenty of laughs and Captain Kirk himself (William Shatner) guest stars. Almost as funny as the first movie. And remember, keep an eye on the background action as well as for the other Sci-Fi movie references. If you bought the first one then get this too!I knew it was a bad day to switch to decaff... :)"
9434,1,Perfect hard-case,"This fit a 17"" notebook computer, as well as all the cables and chargers, easily...and i had room for other stuff.Keep in mind, it's a little bulky...but if you need a hard-case, you can't go wrong here. This would be perfect for someone who travels, or is outdoors a lot...like a contractor.Sturdy, dependable, and travels well...just like a golden retriever."
9435,1,Durable and practical,"No fluff, but if you want something that holds up it does the job. It will carry a fair amount and allows for easy access to your files."
9436,1,"Works well, but a few design quirks","I bought this to replace a 25-year-old Samsonite 6-inch attache case. The fact that the old one worked so well for so long made me buy this one when the handle finally fell off the old one. The new model is sturdy and works well. However, where my old model included dividers in the upper compartment to form three separate compartments, this model has only one compartment. Also, the new one has two hard plastic compartments on the inside of the upper section for storing pens, etc. and an elastic strap that I use for holding a calculator. I would have preferred that the hard plastic compartments be replaced by straps or something more adaptable. If what you have doesn't fit in those hard compartments, they become useless."
9445,1,Father of the Bride,"This is an enjoyable movie with strong performances by Spenser Tracey and a young Elizabeth Taylor. The movie is in clear black and white film, the sound is clear,and the packaging is attractive and easy to open."
9447,1,Give Madonna a break,"Okay, so she's no Meryl Streep but Madonna is not a bad actress! This film proves it. She does a fine job as does the rest of the cast. But, she isn't the centerpiece of the movie, so I really don't see why all the slings and arrows from critics are about her acting. The movie does a good job provoking thought about the issues it explores: what is the definition of a ""family"" in our society today, should a convention family be the mold we all follow, should a gay man have as much parental rights as a straight man etc. There's a good blend of comedy and drama. The movie is no ""Titanic"" but it's still good entertainment, a nice diversion. Fun in the beginning, sad towards the climax, touching by the end. Immitates real life quite a bit. It should fare much better on video."
9449,1,Fun Read!,"I am falling in love with ""Steeple Hill Cafe!!!"" This is just one of the books by this publisher that I have enjoyed reading as a Christian SAHM.I applaud Meredith in her ability to portray different mothering styles. I laughed out loud at many of what these moms thought they were doing ""right""! Many topics hit close to home, especially humility....yeah! gotta keep working on that one!I also admire Meredith for completing this work. I too am a homeschooling mom and adoptive mom, and don't know how she has done it....Thanks!!!"
9450,1,If you plan on getting married get this book!,Listen I have been waiting for a book like this for a long time now. It's really quite simple and the title is self explanatory. I actually got a copy of it a few months ago when the authors sent it to our company for review. It has been a real charm for me. I enjoyed reading all of the questions they came up with in this book. I had a lot more fun answering them on the questionnaire I ordered and I keep it on hand for my future dates.Thumbs up you guys you have a winner.
9456,1,Nina shines,"I highly recommend this recording, especially for her fans, as one of two last studio recordings. This hip, disco style(sometimes)set with R&B; leanings showcases Nina's ability to tear your insides up with melodic and dramatic skills incomparable in her day. Of special note: ""Saratoga"" ""Touching and Caring"".Ken DelleCave, Miami"
9457,1,A high point of adventure in a dismal summer movie season,"Granted that this sequel lags behind the first installment of the series, it is by far superior to anything that followed this summer. In a season of mega CGI ""blockbusters"", here was one with likable and interesting stars and a pace and level of excitement that was breathtaking. Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz come close to being the new ""Indiana and Marion"", indeed it would have been a fantastic casting coup to cast him as Indiana Jones III in the final Harrison Ford flix supposed to be in planning. Imagine Ford, Connery and Fraser as the Jones Boys! The two Mummys make a nice matched set and a good way to spend a rainy afternoon or a late nite with friends."
9458,1,no plot but it works?,unbelievably this movie proves that sometimes a sequal to a stellar movie is to throw at us mondo mayhem and plenty special effects more than any other movie in history. This was a good overrall movie. No scene stood out in particular but it was nicely touched. Computer generated effects have come along way and the THE MUMMY RETURNS best shows that. The plot is almost tossed out the window just so we can see Vosloo and co. make full use of hollywood special effects to the maximum. I think it works perfectly though. This is a must own film especially for those like me who dig special effects.
9464,1,A good fantasy action-adventure!,"I saw this on the big screen, and I loved it! The fantasy elements are great and there's so much sword fights and gunplay it'll knock you silly! However, this does get cheesy at times and the computer-generated effects do tend to get really fake (especially the Scorpion King scene at the end, which looks like something out of ""Ants""). The first one is definetly more realistic and is way better as a horror movie, but this wins over as a fantasy action-adventure. I like them both the same, maybe the first one a teeny-weenie, itsy-bitsy bit more, but I still love this movie."
9465,1,"The Movie was good, but universal will dupe us again.","Today low and behold the mummy returns dvd is brought ot my attention and see that its being called a collectors edition. Now if i remember the original mumy had the collectors edition, the widescreen version and the ultimate edition. I am personaly sick of large movie house companies going out of their way to screw us out of hard earned dollars because we end up buying a bare bones edition of a dvd, while they take thier sweet time getting thier Ultimate editions ready. The movie is good but will the dvd be really worth it the first time out? Something tells me I should'nt hold my breath."
9472,1,all 5 DVDs Mummy 1& 2 Best of the best 1 to 4 and the others,"well totally pissed at first as the DVD's supplied were in the wrong region on all my diskes and this is not the first time evn all my other purchases were the wrong region, had so spend money to by a new DVD player so i'm stricken to what room i can watch these in...i ENJOY MY MOVIES and to have this restriction is a pain, other than this the movies are good...."
9482,1,An almost-excellent action film...,"""Mission: Impossible"" is a nearly perfect film. If it weren't so darn confusing at times, it would be an absolutely wonderful movie. However, it boggles itself down with too much dialogue and confusing plot twists. But it's no doubt a highly-enjoyable movie. Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt, a secret agent who has been betrayed and now must prove his innocence. This is the most of the plot of which we know for sure. The other details are too complicated to really understand, but they don't matter. What matters is the constantly suspenseful moments including the beginning where Hunt and team are chasing after a bad guy to the heist Hunt makes in the CIA building to the incredible helicopter-chasing-the-train sequence that makes up the film's climax. There's much to enjoy in this movie and, if you watch it a few times, it even begins to make sense. I highly recommend it to any action fan who doesn't mind thinking every now and then. It's a superb action flick."
9484,1,So much fun!,"The only reason this movie doesn't get 5 stars is that it is a little hard to keep up with. The complicated plot takes so many twists I had to see it twice to follow them all. Otherwise smart, excellent fun!"
9490,1,Recommended,"There's something poetic in Cameron's writing here that kept surprising and delighting me. Keen observations told in direct but simple phrases. I don't agree with the reviewers who dismiss this book because it fails their accuracy test- to me it is a work of fiction, a closed world that reflects our feelings, not facts. For me it is an extremely sad book dealing with desperation, grief and loss, lies and self-deception. The way the narrator manipulates, or attempts to manipulate, the world around him, particularly women, unnerves me. Yet it does so because this touches on the truth of how many smart but desperate people interface with the world."
9498,1,WINGS flying high!,"""Back to the Egg"" contains more great music than any other WINGS collection (bar WINGSPAN). As other reviewers have stated, the vinyl release is a rollercoaster ride of musical style that can be unnerving, but all of the pieces are amazing in their own way. This is some of WINGS best music ever, making it easy to forgive the track layout. Programming this CD to best suit your taste is recommended. Rock fans should select ""Spin it On"", ""Old Siam, Sir"", ""Rockestra Theme"", & ""So Glad to See You Here"". Softer music lovers would prefer ""Getting Closer"", ""We're Open Tonight"", & ""Arrow Through Me"". The remaining pieces are also of varying interest. No matter how you slice it, this is outstanding music, perhaps the best WINGS ever produced. Something great for everyone willing to weed through it."
9501,1,Excellent,"I've never understood the negativity associated with this album. Paul sings his guts out, the songs are good and rock very well indeed."
9502,1,Almost Band On The Run,"This is easily one of Paul's best albums. In retrospect, it's sad to say that it was also one of his last really rocking albums as well. Possibly the lone exception is Flaming Pie. Unfortunately, I am of the age to remember this album in its initial release, and to this day, more than 30 years later, I still can't understand why it was a failure. Maybe the public was still in the disco craze, and this gem seemed to slip by. Also, if I recall, it received a lot of unfavorable publicity, saying that the final product was less than what Paul wanted, his own version of a Who-style rock opera. Shame really because this album is loaded with great material. Definately more than worth a look see if you ask me...perhaps not the rock opera masterpiece that Paul originally wanted, but pretty damn good in my book..."
9503,1,A TASTY MUSICAL OMELET,"BACK TO THE EGG is a scrambled mix typical of the virtuoso performer and songwriter.McCartney has never pigeonholed himself into one style of music. He explores every branch of the musical tree and has silenced his critics by doing each style in his own inimitable way.EGG has some great moments that overshadow a couple ventures into mediocrity.Highlights for me: ARROW THROUGH ME, a smartly arranged funk tune that's one of my favorite Wings efforts; the pop smoothness of GETTING CLOSER; the star-laden instrumental ROCKESTRA THEME; the two melodic medleys AFTER THE BALL/MILLION MILES and WINTER ROSE/LOVE AWAKE; the driving DAYTIME NIGHTTIME SUFFERING. Even the sometime annoying WONDERFUL CHRISMASTIME is unavoidably infectious.McCartney has been an iconic figure since the Beatles and has earned his place as one of pop's true legends. While not a brilliant album, EGG is a fine example of McCartney's genius."
9505,1,book from the past.,"I purchased this book because I remembered I read it as a young child. I still love the pictures and the characters but I do have to agree with alot of other reiews that this book is not appropriate for children. The story is dark (a child who's left alone with no explaination of why ), spanking is used as a form of punishment, and the idea of strangers taking over a child's welfare is creepy. I love the book for the pictures and the layout. I suggest buying this book but not giving it to a young child."
9510,1,excellent and a half,"The Insider would have worked as a plot-driven film. Jeff Weigand has his family and career destroyed when he revelas corperate dirt on big tabacco.But what makes the film so incredible is that it is in fact charactor driven, not just moved ahead by story. The cerebral, family oritented yet emotional Wiegand-Russel Crowe-is contrasted with the hip, radical 60 Minutes Producer Lowell Bergman, played by Al Pachino.Both charactors dig their heals into their positions, and watcing these two passionate but extremely bright guys in give and take is simply incredible to watch.The acting is incredible. Both men want, often, conflicting things--Wiegand some shred of privacy and protection, Bergman his story and all he needs to know to protect Wiegand.The subtance of the tobacco litigation is interesting. But the drives of both men--and how smartly this is discussed-is what makes the Insider a cut above most whistle blower movies."
9516,1,Hoping to see More Objective movies like this,"I think that the war against Nicotine is not an easy one to engage in.This film is very interesting and touches the life of an individual who had to go through hell to do the moral thing.Both Pacino and Crowe did a good job. However, the movie was VERY slow paced; and could have possibly been covered in half the time.Good point nonetheless. I am a Nicotine Addict by the way, and I have been living without Nicotine for the last 4 months."
9528,1,Catchy little band...,"o.k. I'll freely admit that I picked up this CD cause I am a big fan of Lovecraft and I knew that this band was just as into the old gentleman from Providence. I must say that even without the obvious Lovecraft refrences this cd would be well worth the money. Each track has an infectious surf-punk energy all of its own. Since this was the soundtrack for a never (?) released B sci-fi flick the irrevrence that the band carries is very welcome considering the inspiration for a good chunk of the songs on this disc. Personal faves on this would be ""20 Minutes of Oxygen,"" ""The Innsmouth Look (he made love to the fishies),"" and ""The Math Song."" So if you are a fan of the whole Lovecraft/Cthulhu Mythos thing, this CD is well worth picking up. If you like songs that are fun, carefree and a little funny, take a listen to the downloads to make your decision."
9535,1,Sunlight and Shadow,"I enjoyed reading Sunlight & Shadow immensely. It's a novel placed in the multi cultural setting of contemporary NM. The blend of cultures, personalities & generations evoked a wide range and intensity of feeling for me. I laughed; cried; I raged; I worried. Having lived in NM for over 30 years I find it hauntingly familar. This is a book for people who embrace diversity; people who smile when others are different from themselves and know they're not that different. I sincerely hope there is a sequel.CJA"
9537,1,Lots of Fun,"I played this myself, and I have 5 and 9 year old sons who also played, and we all enjoyed it. Initially it was a little confusing and I highly recommend the tutorials. Once we got into the game it was quite fun, even for my 5 year old who didn't understand half of it but didn't have too much trouble with the controls. What I really liked was the freedom and open-world aspect of the game. There seem to be no shortage of events and random things to do. The graphics are very good and the game play is addictive. Top grades on this product!"
9540,1,Canon PIXMA MP800R: A Great All-in-One Printer,"I researched color all-in-one printers carefully before selecting the Canon PIXMA MP800R. If I could use half stars, I would rate this a 4 1/2. The sound level (extremely quiet), print quality and ease of use are all great. The scanner and copier work well and are fast. The wireless networking feature is great for a Small Office or Home Office (SOHO) network with several computers.The only drawback is that the unit lacks a FAX modem. I realize that FAX machines are on the way out, since you can scan a document and then e-mail it. Also, if you often copy or scan multi-page documents, buy the Canon PIXMA MP800, which has an automatic document feeder."
9546,1,"So funny, but I had a hard time with Ed Norton as a priest..","I LOVED this movie!!! Ben Stiller, Jenna Elfman, and Ed Norton make an excellent comical team!!! My favorite part is when Father Brian goes to pick up Rabbi Schram while Anna is over at his apartment. Catholics who befriend Jews and Jews who befriend Catholics, are sure to appreiate this movie. The only aspect of the movie that bothered me was that Ed Norton played a priest because I think he is so HOT and I had a hard time gawking at him while he was in cleric's clothing."
9558,1,Still Good After All These Years...,"ALthough there's no surround sound, this is a very good show. I bet it'll startle your kids at the end, if they've never watched it before."
9567,1,"Wonderful Drama, Action, Moving: A-, Music A+, DVD Extras A,","This is a solid drama and action movie. What makes it unique is that it is based on a true story. The music is incredible and just makes this a wonderful drama and action film! The music makes you re-live the 60's and 70's. Johny Depp is outstanding. Absolutely wonderful extras on this DVD, including an excellent documentary on Colmbia and COCAINE. This movie carries a wide variety of emotions. You'll be sure to be moved.As entertaining as this movie is, it just goes to show how that drugs and self destruction go hand in hand. Blow definitely exceeded my expectations."
9571,1,Valuable but needs an update,"This book is very useful and even necessary if you're planning to go to Peru. However, prices (hotels, restaurants and airport tax...) need to be updated!"
9577,1,Makes you want to think...,"Personally, I had to read this book for an ENglish class that I needed to graduate with. A friend in telling me about the book implied that the guy was a selfish so and so, and when I read it, I felt that Mersault just didn't care one way or the other what he wanted.Just because he didn't cry at his own mother's funeral, they handed him a harsh sentence?? No previous crimes, no rap sheet, alright, he took a life, one life that didn't have nothing to do with him except for his friend making him do it. Let's look at this. The guy had no goals, no ambitions, no nothing. He has a girl, but it don't mean a thing to him one way or the other. Does that make him amoral?? I feel it makes him irresponsible,unfeeling, and aimless."
9589,1,"Quick read, worthwhile, thought-provoking","This was a novel I purchased for my English class.We were instructed to choose one of nine different perspectives to read from, I was assigned sadness.This novel encompasses many more different aspects, but from the view I had taken, this proved to be a great novel with the contemporary spin on religion and how the human conscience adapts to prevail over everyday struggle. I greatly enjoyed reading it, about a two hour straight through session of reading! Very worthwhile."
9599,1,A nice novelty item,"This item arrived within the projected delivery window. The shirt looks good. I would've liked for the graphic to have been bigger considering I bought a XXL, but it was straight and centered. I dig it for its novelty and will wear it as a proud and loyal Bears fan!"
9613,1,The wonderful thoughts of Danyel,I don't read alot but i am glad that i made myself read this book because it really touch me and it influenced me to want to read more. The wonderful story tells of love that is lost and found and how love can change your life forever. One main asset that i recived is that if you loose a love you can move on and still find happiness. This book is now my favorite book to just sit down and get lost in it. I love how Mr.Patterson makes you feel as if you are a part of the story. I hope to have a love like this book gives.
9622,1,Great Doo-Wop,Great Collection all on two CD's. Most compltete of the collections I previewed. Definately worth the $$.
9625,1,I thought it was good. Same deal as the others before it.,"They all have the same generic plot to them except fordifferent mysteries. The end was actually surprisingwith it's couple of twists. I think this book is whereI end my reading of Nancy Drew. The books were goodand occupied my time in a good way. They were fastenjoyable reads that I could read in a few hours.thank you for your timeand feel free to commentthis review,Loran"
9631,1,Savini know's how to do a Romero remake with style,"Usually remakes are terrible, but not in this case. Savini had Romero on board as a producer and really did not deviate from the original NOTLD. He found a way to mordernize the film and stay true to it's integrity. He did change things a little mostly the ending but did it a way that left Romaro fans very happy. Savini's respect for George Romero is seen in this remake. Weather it is Martin or Dawn of the dead the Savini/Romero team really shine. The movie opens much like the original and stay's remotely close to the original movie for most of the film. Of course Savini throws in his own changes and the final plot twist is different from the original NOTLD. Savini show's promise as a horror movie director here and as always the special affects are great for the era."
9634,1,Worthy Remake,"I really enjoyed this remake written by the master himself, george romero. I liked the character devlopment better, and these are some of the best zombies i've seen. I only wished that savini had gotten to film his extra stuff and make an unrated version. That would have been great. I liked this film, honorable to the original, but with good enhancements, some I find better."
9636,1,Not bad for a remake,I have never been much of a fan of remakes or sequels but I didn't think this one was so bad. It stars Tony Todd(Candyman) and has the same plot as the original. Maybe I'm partial to this one because it's done in color and I belive the special effects are better. The movie overall is creepy and wastes no time in getting to the good stuff. Of course in most horror movies there isn't much of a storyline but if you wanted a storyline you wouldn't be watching a horror flick. If you saw the original Night of the Living Dead I believe you should see this version as well and compare for yourself. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
9639,1,Enjoyable Love Move,I was pleased with my movie selection and the services rendered was AWESOME. The product was received timely and in great condition. I would definitely buy from this vendor again.
9652,1,"Cute, Light Romantic Commedy","If you like romantic comedies, you'll enjoy ""Doc Hollywood"". Starring Michael J. Fox, it is everything you would want in a romatic comedy, with attractive, likeable stars and talented, interesting supporting characters...and a cute pig.I watched it with my two teenage daughters - it ended with us all smiling!One note: My daugthers pointed out how the recent animated movie ""Cars"" seemed to be based on exactly the same story line."
9655,1,I Ordered This DVD For The Same Relative,"This is another movie that I ordered for the same relative. They don't own a computer, so they aren't able to order those good movies that you can't find in a video, or department store. I'm sure they are enjoying this movie. They would have let me known if there was a problem."
9656,1,4 out of 5 cuz pinocchio is a great movie but Disney fouled up the end game.,"WTF mate! Pinocchio is one of the best Disney accomplishments so i would presume the Blu ray would bring it justice...however we civilians are denied the right to view this masterpiece in it's 1080p full-screen or wide-screen glory we are forced to view Pinocchio with black side bars because some genius wants everyone to view the movie the ""Right"" way (a 1.33:1 ratio) rather than the natural 16x9 ratio of our TV)...apparently no one told the Disney staff there was plenty of room on the disk to have the full-screen, wide-screen, and this blu ray studio first ""Disney view"" I recommend the movie based on its value as a masterpiece but this new found idea called ""Disney View"" is quite upsetting and will probably ruin the lovely Snow white! soon to be released btw"
9665,1,Watch Martin Sheen's Chilling Portrayal Of Greg Stillson,"This film is a good adaption of King's ""Deadzone."" It is a good film but not great. It is about Johnny emerging from a 5-year-long coma with extraordinary psychic powers allowing him to see visions in the past, present and future. With these powers Johnny gets an opportunity to save the world from a nuclear exchange and takes that opportunity at the cost of his own life. Martin Sheen is convincing as a psychotic Senate hopeful aspiring to be the President of the USA."
9668,1,Good look into the emotional life of boys.,"I found this book to be very insightful and interesting. I had to read a book for a college psychology course and this was on the book list. The book is formatted in a very interesting way. The writers do not simply give you a buch of information about boys and their thoughts. They focuss on experiences and stories they have encountered with boys. They then use these experiences and interperet them and relate them to what they see as an area of concern for boys. Things they consider is emotions, violence, relationships, and boy sterotyping. Because it is almost a collection of stories the book continues to be very comelling. Like the cover states I would say that this is ""...required reading for anyone raisin-or educating-a boy"""
9672,1,Fun to Watch,"This movie clearly shows that the cast and the director didn't take the movie seriously. But that's okay because Tremors is fun to watch, hilarious in some scenes, and not too much blood and gore to make it just like a horror flick. All the actors played their parts very well and the plot is good enough for a movie like this. In fact, my major dissapointment is that the monsters don't look anything like the thing on the cover.All,in all, a great video to watch when trying to relax or having a party."
9674,1,Tremors,"""Tremors"" is a delightful surprise of a monster movie, taking advice from the old-fashioned 1950s films of its kind. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward star as a couple of independent cusses that come across an extraordinary discovery--a decapitated sheep rancher and his gruesome devoured flock. Along with a earthquake specialist, they are forced to fight for their lives against a pack of underground flesh-eating, giant worms. Superb performances from Bacon and Ward, who carry the film with their charming wit and ruthless attitudes. Excellent special effects and a script that doesn't take itself too seriously makes ""Tremors"" one of the most entertaining, campy monster movies of the last ten years. Director: Ron Underwood. Cast: Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter, Michael Gross, Reba McEntire, Victor Wong. Rated PG-13 for violence, gore, and language. 98 minutes."
9675,1,A definite classic of mosterous proportion!,"Tremors combines comedy, adventure and action into one film that will always be remembered as a classic. If you enjoy Sci-fi and action based movies then this is a right choice for you. Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward and Michael Gross all live in Perfection, Nevada where the graboids start attacking. Armed with Burk's arsenal of M-16s, Uzis, shotguns, handguns, these graboids don't stand a chance or do they? One most memorable scenes is ""Uzi for U"", in which a graboid crashes into Burk's basement where his Wall of weaponry is located, and Burk and his wife use a plethora of guns to fire numerous bullets into the graboid. Although the movie is completly entertaining, the DVD lacks 5.1 digital sound, and has limited special features."
9681,1,Not just for Latinos,"For those who have read the Hijuelos book from which this film is adapted, you may be disappointed because it lacks the detail that the book provides. However, the visuals provided by ensemble performance scenes and stunning performances by the entire cast let you even deeper into the world of the Latino music scene of 1950's New York City. The story is as moving as the music is splendid. Get this movie for those late nights when a little glamour and heartbreak is needed."
9682,1,Great Film. Exhilirating And Romantic.,"""The Mambo Kings"" is an exhilirating and sweet, romantic story. I totally liked it. I'm Hispanic so I appreciate the great work done in this film. Antonio Banderas gives an entertaining performance and the music is pure enjoyment! I especially liked the cinematography and dramatic elements of the screenplay. ""The Mambo Kings"" is just a pure delight and good time at the movies. Cubanos will really like it too! This is a fun film that's sweet, heartbreaking, wildly erotic and romantic. One of the best films based on a Latino subject ever."
9687,1,Great starter set or decor for the price.,"This set is a great starter set for someone looking to enhance their bar area. Or to be used as decoration. Don't expect for it to be a well used set. The glass is very thin and easily breakable. The tray I was a lil dissapointed with. They call it acryllic, I call it plastic. It will make a great piece for your house. My first set arrived broken and used...but of course, Amazon rocks and they replaced the set. You cannot beat Amazon's, Service, Selection & Price. Thus... buy this and your satisfaction will of course be guaranteed. Buy it for $20 or less, your getting a great bargain. Any other price is ""OK.""(speaking of the 8 piece circle martini set)"
9691,1,...and I thought it would be difficult.,"Trapped on in this supreme-being forsaken world with no fuel for my starship, and here I find they distribute fuel for a reasonable price. Only 500 more metric tons and I'm out of here! This world really is odd..."
9695,1,Should do the trick...,"Bought this to go with the historically accurate recreation of Los Alamos that a small group of us have been working on over in New Mexico. Eagerly looking forward to finishing off our little gadget as soon as I can get on board a standard airine with it (random bag checks have picked it up twice now, but on the bright side all the airport sniffer dogs have dropped dead).Excellent product at an excellent price!"
9699,1,Bush/Cheney brilliant coup,"The Bush administration, with help from Congress, AIPAC, and an ersatz Fourth Estate, has accomplished its mission to freedom-nudge both Afghanistan and Iraq back to the stone age, denying the bad guys the infrastructure and electricity needed to access the internets, with the intention of purchasing large quantities of uranium and bonus free shipping and the added convenience of ""one-click"" check-out that only a quality outfit like Amazon can offer."
9703,1,Truly organic!,"My tomatoes and cucumbers have never had better yields! Best of all, its organic!! I mix a little with the compost every month and amend my garden every 2 months.Funny, though, the deer and opossums have stopped browsing through the garden. I think the 4 foot tall Praying Mantis, and 18 inch wide garden spiders have done their job.Now if I could only get the kids to STOP saddling the tomato horn worms and convice them their NOT beneficial insects.Love this stuff!!"
9710,1,Female empowerment with a love story,"This movie was wonderful. It made me laugh, cry, and filled my heart with love. This is definatly a chick-flick kind of movie, so if you're not into those you probably won't like this movie very much. Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in the movie. He has so really hilarious scenes throughout What Women Want. Another thing I really liked about the movie was the main female characters portrayal. She was a highly successful women in the corprate world. She shows real independence as a person, she's a really strong character. Her character gives off a women power feel. This is yet another reason this movie is so good. It is empowers you to be a women. I would highly recommend this movie to any female."
9723,1,chi,detail description and instructions on how to use tai chi and the reason and uses for the program. So far it has been very helpful.
9725,1,4 stars because I did enjoy reading it even though...,"... I was really expecting a lot more from this book. I purchased it for the story ""Don't Look Now"", which is often said is a mere shadow of what I think is a great film(even though the book came first). I felt that all of the stories pulled you in to begin with, but the endings were just flat? ""Not after Midnight"" was pretty good but again the ending did no justice. ""The Way of the Cross"" was also interesting, great character development from the little boy ""Robin"" way too wise for his age and ""Rev. Babcock"" talk about conflicted! But again the ending just left you empty? Not that I wanted blood and ghastliness, but just a bit more force or painful irony,à la ""The Twilight Zone""This is a good book to read to and from work (if you take the train or bus of course!)"
9727,1,Big Long Book(that's a plus),"Well, as any person would first notice about this book, it's HUGE! Or, at least it looked that way. I found the random use of French words irritating and i think that if a book is going to be translated they should at least translate it all of the way. I understand that the French is supposed to make an impression on me, but i like to know what i'm reading about. I love the plot. I love being able to constantly have to remember people who have not been mentioned in around 400 pages and have to test my brain to keep the plot straight. The other great thing is to be able to realize what's happening befor eit has been pointed out. READ THIS! pace yourself, and, if you don't like remembering too much at once, make a flow chart!"
9728,1,Great book,"The story is very captating, it taps into two of humanities' basic desires; revenge and power. Too many french words were left unexplained in the book, I assume that they were just copied from the original text. That is the only reason that the book was kept from attaining the ultimate goal of five stars. If you liked the Three Musketeers, you'll love this book"
9732,1,Great translation,"This is one of the books I should have read ages ago but have never picked up. I first started to read a different translation, but the language and sentence structure gave it no narrative flow. The Buss translation is terrific. The adventure tale of wrongful imprisonment and revenge keeps you reading for long periods of time. A little history lesson about Napolean and the Borgias is painless and welcome. When we read older books we are reminded how little human emotions have changed over 200 years.This translation is highly recommended."
9734,1,"The Story is excellent, and this is the Unabridged edition","This is the only Unabridged edition of The Count of Monte Cristo I have been able to find for Kindle. It looks like a public domain copy that has been adapted, but it is formatted well. It doesn't say who the translator is. It has the whole 117 chapters. It is worth the 99 cents, if you want the unabridged version. I think if you read the abridged you are missing out on some great parts of a great story. I gave this 4 stars because it looks like the public domain and has no extas that a lot of the big publishers have, but still, a great buy and a great version."
9739,1,Don't read the abridged version!,"While I really enjoyed The Count of Monte Cristo, I felt that there was something missing. Imagine my shock when I came here and read the reviews stating that the unabridged book is 1400 pages long; and I realized that I had read the ABRIDGED version at 472 pages long!! Obviously, they cut a lot out of the abridged version. While it was still very good, it was lacking and I felt there were ""holes"" in the story (now I know why). I'll definitely be buying the unabridged version so I can re-read it."
9741,1,OK,The device did exactly what I bought it for. It worked OK. The amplifier performed as expected. I liked it.
9743,1,Mission Impossible,"The first movie is better than the rest. But, my son loves them and that's what counts."
9745,1,Bat'riffic,This is one of many albums made in the late sixties to cash in on the Batman tv show craze.It has some great action music that remind's me of many tv spy and cop show's like Man From U.N.C.L.E. and I Spy.If your a fan of these show's you will enjoy this music.
9749,1,Great Movie but the Special DVD features aren't that special,"This is an awesome movie, but I held out buying the original DVD until they came out with a Collector's Edition DVD with special features.As it turns out, I was somewhat disappointed by the special features. The commentary was good, but the featurette was only about 7 minutes long. Also, the 3 music videos were pretty bad quality (I am sure they were transferred off of tape that was about 15 years old). Also, the musical didn't really hold my interest. However, this DVD has so many extra features that if you only like half of them, that is still quite a bit."
9754,1,Great Record,"One of the best R&B albums of the year. U Got It Bad, U Turn and Help Me particularly stand out."
9767,1,Very interesting at times but .... sometimes disturbing,Truly it was a very good movie. Ewan McGregor one of my all-time favorite actors and veryyy goodlooking i might add was extremely good in this film. I think this film is for movie lovers because you have to really WATCH it not just try to watch it and be rather confused. My friend watched it with me and hated it and said I ruined her life for renting it. But I can watch the movies that are really boring to people. And I really liked this film. Ewan was so great in this and had a really strong presence and even though...and some of the love scenes disturb me to this day ..it was very good and well made ( well because Ewan made it of course!)
9769,1,GREAT FOR BUDGET,"Well as I said, great for a budget DVD set...We have had a few other BEVERLY HILLBILLIES on budget DVD's before and this is about as good as your going to get in this price range...However, they do leave out the original famous intro song...But I understand that might have been part of some type *Legal Agreement* to release as a budget set........BOB"
9774,1,Did I enjoy it BECAUSE I had no idea what was happening?,"At the end all I could come up with was, 'I really like it, but I have no idea why.'I think I enjoyed it for the same reason I hated it. I'm a little tired of too much detail, predictability, and some authors tendancey to spell everything out from page one. Cast in Shadow did not spell out anything....I'm still trying to process it several days later. It bordered on infuriating-the feeling that I just never really figured out what they were talking about, what was going on, or the general point of anything. But it was also very entertaining and I can't wait to get Cast in Courtlight."
9775,1,Engaging and fast paced = great read!,"I picked this up just a week ago and have since been compelled to buy both of the follow-ups, and I can't wait until the fourth book is coincidentally released next month! Kayla was raised in a tough neighborhood but now belongs to a quasi-police force called the hawks. As much as she tries to forget her violent and painful past she can't escape the mysterious marks on her body, and when she is assigned to investigate the murder of children bearing similar marks Kaylin is forced to draw on strength and magic she didn't know she possesed. Complicating an already complex situation, her new partner is not exactly new to her. He's from her old neighborhood and was like a brother to her until a startling act of violence forever ended her childhood. Through the course of the investigation Kaylin will encounter magic and ancient races that will help her realize she might of escaped her past, but it will still affect her future."
9776,1,Cast In Shadow,"A fast moving, believable sci fi. Written with humor, the characters bring the imagination to full alert. Looking forward to seeing the heroine grow to her full potential in future stories."
9777,1,A very enjoyable read!,"Kaylin is a member of the Hawks (the city of Elantra's police force). She is given an assignment to investigate a series of deaths in the Nightshade, the fief she had escaped from seven years earlier, with a Dragon Lord and a man she knows she can't trust as her partners. Deaths linked closely to her and the mysterious markings that cover her body. Kaylin is forced to deal with not only the murderers but her past and unusual powers as well.This is the first book I have read by Michelle Sagara and I look forward to reading more by her in the future. The plot moved quickly and although some scenes were hard to follow/understand they were later explained and I did not feel they detracted from the story. The next book in the series comes out in August and I cannot wait to read it. I would definitely recommend this book."
9782,1,I loved it,Being that I saw this movie before it was a must for me to get this movie ! so now i haVe it and enjoying it the case was perfect the Dvd was perfect quality !
9785,1,4.2 out of 5,"Adapted from Robin Moore's fact-based novel, THE FRENCH CONNECTION was the breakthrough film for both direction William Friedkin, who later went on to direct THE EXORCIST, and Gene Hackman. Hackman stars in his Academy Award-winning role as ""Popeye"" Doyle, a New York City cop who, along with partner ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider), stumbles upon a drug ring headed by a Frenchman (Fernando Rey) who uses an innocent-seeming actor (Frederic de Pasquale) to cover the operation. Along with Hackman's forementioned award for ""Best Actor"", the film also took in Best Director for Friedkin; Best Film Editing; Best Writing (Ernest Tidyman) and a deserved Best Picture. The chase scenes are outstanding and some of the best ever filmed; Hackman is excellent in one of his greatest roles. Action fans won't want to pass this one by; followed by FRENCH CONNECTION II and a floppish TV movie."
9787,1,Good overal picture,"The book has a good overall explanation of techniques used by firefighters. There are examples of personal experiences which help illustrate the need for the protocols discussed. As with all good books however, it contradicts itself while describing the recommended procedures based on the extenuating circumstances."
9791,1,Crystal Growing Science Kit,"This was a gift to my grandson and he was mesmerized and could not wait to start growing the crystals. I told him I did something like that when I was a child, grew rock formations in a fish bowl."
9792,1,"Fun, but limited fun!","I got this for my 5-year-old son who loves science. The directions are simple, but patience of a 5-year-old is not! I really wanted him to be involved, but I had to pretty much do the whole thing while he watched and his attention wasn't really in it so basically- I had a lot of fun! I recommend this for maybe 6 years and older. This was my fault being over eager for a project that was for a child too young to have the patience! And please don't misunderstand me! This kit was fun!!!"
9798,1,Excellent primer for bullfighting lore.,"I've reread this book for the third time this time. Main, and very vital, misgiving is that I miss the pictures in the real book. If you don't want to miss the former, get the paperback or hardcover. It's worth more than half the totality of the book."
9810,1,kinda complicated but worth it,"I really actually liked reading Dune. It was full of many complicated things that stacked up and stacked up. But it also keeps you hooked. The story line was good and I thought that it all tied together very well in the end. It made me want to finish it to see what would happen in the end. Its a book you have to read over and over again to really understand it and to really catch it all, in a year or two I will probably go back and read it again."
9819,1,Not as good as Dune but still good.,"I loved Dune but this book does make a good addition to the Dune books, it was a little slower in pace and to much politics but the scheming and lies were absolutly brilliant, if you've read Dune and liked it why not go ahead and read the entire series."
9821,1,"Great story, but no match for the original.","Dune Messiah is a much less ambitious book that its predecessor, but that doesn't mean it comes short as one of the greatest sci-fi books ever. Much shorter than ""Dune"", this sequel focuses on just a couple of storylines at a time, and basically serves its purpose: present the outcome of Paul Muadib as ruler of the universe and prepare us for the coming of his children, whose actions, narrated on the forecoming novels, are the real juice of the saga. Anyway, Dune Messiah has a simple, entertaining story, but you certainly can't stop there. In order to find out what's the destiny of the universe, you need to read the ones that follow this sequel."
9823,1,Dune messiah,"Solid read! A little slow at times, but a good 3rd Dune. I'm ready to see what appens next, which accomplishes the author's goal."
9832,1,"Amazing book, but.....","Dune is a great book, the problem however is with this edition. There are several obvious spelling errors, and at least twice i've seen whole lines repeated twice in a row. Try a different editon."
9834,1,Wow!!,"This is the first book of Leiber's that I have read and I am very impressed. Though the book was written in the 1950's it is able to transend 40 odd years and still be relevent in todays thinking. The most interesting twist is how Leiber moved away from science explaining the supernatural to science using the supernatural to maintain control on an ignorant society of peasents. Another impressive twist to the book was Leiber's ability to move the focus of the novel from between three different, yet important characters, without any interuption. I can not wait to read more of his books."
9839,1,Becoming Jane Austen,"Nicely done movie and well acted as well! ""Becoming Jane"" shows us a young Jane Austen already dabbling in writing, but hasn't as yet grown into the writer we know her as today. This movie is really about Jane finding out who she really is and wants from life.In ""Becoming Jane"", we learn of Jane's family life and about the social circumstances surrounding life and etiquette during the era in which she grows up. Life is really confining for women back then. It seems that a woman is pushed into marrying a wealthy man regardless if her has feelings of love for him or not.... And being a spinster is definitely frowned upon altogether, let along deciding to create a career for yourself as a writer.We see a side of Jane Austen's personality we may never know about from reading her novels and about the love she gave up for the sake of foraging ahead to become one of the world's greatest women writers."
9840,1,Jane was becoming,"Sort of like watching the real life Pride and Prejudice. It is a movie wive's like and husbands can watch. The costumes and country scenes look convincing, and the acting is credible."
9842,1,"Sweet, sad film","OK. So it isn't historically accurate. OK so Anne Hathaway is American and she's too tall to play Jane Austen. I will be buying this film the minute it comes out because I almost irrationally loved it the two times I saw in in the theatre. The supporting cast is excellent, the Ireland location stunning and the soundtrack lovely. I will, however, be buying this film because James McAvoy makes everyone and everything around him in this movie, better. He is a gifted actor and you can't help but fall in love with him and his character in this film. You know going in that there will not be a happy ending in the ""romantic"" sense...but the journey is sad and sweet. It is just a lovely film."
9843,1,Great,This is a very exciting movie. When I first saw it I was on the edge of my seat. I unfortunately missed this movie in the cinema. I didn't even get round to seeing it o video until mid 1998. Great performances by Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt. Terrific music score by James Horner and spectacular special effects. You'll love this movie.
9846,1,:0),How can u not like JUMANJI alot of action and fun it almost makes u feel like your playing the game with them
9851,1,Definitive,I love this book. I got it about a year ago and I read it cover to cover over the course of a month. It makes great bathroom reading! The thing that's really great about this book is that you get the story behind all of the songs. Reading the backstory for all of my favorite tunes gave them a new life and made me want to go listen to them again -- to see them in that new light. Another interesting aspect is that even the covers are given some backstory -- including extensive information about the orig. artists. Then there's the in-depth information about the Dead themselves. Want to know more about Tom Constantine? It's there. Interested in Bruce Hornsby's connection to the Dead? It's there too. Overall I love having this book in my collection. It's a great reference book as well as a damn good read. I strongly recommend this to all Dead-heads!
9860,1,Don't Judge the Man; Judge the Book,"This book was well-written and well-researched, regardless of how I may feel about Kerry's political stance. My husband is retired Navy, a veteran of the riverine war in Vietnam. My husband read this book and recommended it to me, not on the basis of the character (or lack thereof) of John Kerry but because the descriptions and history of the riverine war were accurate. For those who want to disparage the book, there are numberless accounts of Vietnam veterans whose time in-country lasted a day or lasted five years. My husband reads every one he can get his hands on, so I know they are out there. That he recommended this to me above so many others he has read is because, in his words, ""this one is accurate."" Forget that John Kerry happens to be the sailer in question and study the Vietnam War."
9865,1,"""we said goodnight this morning""","simply said, The Night is the devil's coktail party music, deep dark dirty smoky and sexy all the good things you're not supposed to to love...as one of my friends always says...""morphine IS sex"""
9872,1,FUNNY MOVIE,"This Movie Is OMG FUNNY. I Have Only Laughed Like This A Few Times In My Life, But WoW This Was Great Stuff"
9874,1,Clear and to the point,"This is an excellent textbook for an introductory course in Real Analysis. The text is rigorous, but contains enough examples to be readily understood. If you honestly want to learn the subject matter, this book is worth the money. However, if you would rather struggle with it, there are plenty of those books floating around . . ."
9877,1,Delivers TONS of action but not much else,"This past summer I went to see ""XXX"" and was pleasantly surprised. I thought that Rob Cohen was going to just make another action movie interrupted by an attempt at making a coherent story. XXX didn't do that though. The movie does not take itself seriously as the dialogue shows. However the film has some great action sequences and plenty of them. That is where this movie gets the four stars from me. The actors in the movie did a good enough job of moving the film along from action scene to action scene which is good enough for a film like this. If you are an action junkie then give this movie a rent to see if you like it. If you are looking for a movie that'll make you think do a 180 and don't see this one."
9879,1,excellent movie,"this had to be to be one of the best movies with not to many flaws. the action part was great and the gun was super cool. the only flaw was all the extreame sports part. the jump off the car was cool, but grinding down a rail with a dinner platter,? come on! over all the movie was very good."
9887,1,A very good book,"Warren has created a book not about ""the rise and fall or an American dictator"" as one edition has written across the cover- which has deprived the novel of its due fame. ""All the King's Men"" deals with Jack Burden's inability to fathom actions have consequences and this is rather interesting. Anyone can see Warren is a very learnt and well-read author. His novel relates to Huey Long (Willie Stark) - the political figure in Lousiana although the main character is NOT Willie Stark - but Jack Burden the narrator and reporter. I found this book philosphical and well-written. It is true one can not sympathize with the protagonist who palys the role of an anti-hero. Not the most interesting but very thought-provoking. ~15 yrs."
9892,1,Even stranger...,"Some time ago, I wrote a review for this book. I was then on the second reading of the book, and decided that it had no merits other than the writing style. That was earlier today. Well, I began reading again, from the beginning, and the most insane thing happened - I began loving the book. And not just that, I read for hours on end, finishing at least a quarter of the book before my first break. Still, I don't feel that this is the best book ever, and in a similar vein (as far as writing style is concerned anyway) Ulysses is much better, but then again, Ulysses is one of my all-time favourites."
9894,1,Could be better,"There were a few too many stains for my taste, and there was some writing on the inside though for the price it was a great deal."
9897,1,Good Movie (how generic is that?),"To start out - Steven Weber, however likeable he might be, is the only person miscast in this movie. I didn't buy anything he said or did. He just looked uncomfortable the entire way through the movie.That being said - I don't think there is a weak cast member here. There are not a lot of major characters - but lots and lots of great supporting roles. Michael T. Weiss does a great job as Steven.Sigourney Weaver and Nathan Lane both should have been nominated for Best Supporting roles from this movie. Of course, that would never happen because they could never ever ever play the clips at any televised award show. Both scenes are priceless. Kathy Najimy, Patrick Stewart and Bryan Batt all do outstanding jobs....and the scene where Jeffrey talks to his parents on the phone is worth the rental fee alone."
9901,1,"Hey, it's the Rolling Stones...","The Rolling Stones are great. This CD is by the Rolling Stones, thus great also. One thing pissed me off though. I hate it when bands I love get political, especially in this way. That song should not have made the cut, it's ridiculous and not even that good.However, the rest of the album is great Stones music. Get it if you're a Stone's fan.That's it!"
9907,1,Veterans Victory,"The Rolling Stones have suceeded in my opinon with this new record in outdoing present day rock-posers. It is unfair to compare it to any earlier effort, becase they speak here of contemporary times. Now is where it's at; Not 1981 or 1972 or 1968, but 2005.Funny we don't allow rockers the same grace we give jazzmen or blues singers/artists. An aged jazz player is given points for substance and soul rather than looks. But not so with rock and roll.But if posers are what you want, psuedo-angry music industry sellouts, then stay away from this record. Hey maybe you can invent somthing of your own rather than copying from the 1960's.It's only rock and roll...still"
9912,1,ABOUT TIME,"""Let's talk about Sex,"" which was not done often enough in the past generations - thus, a lot of ridiulous ideas and beliefs were floating around what happens in the bedroom, or for that matter, in parked cars and behind barns. Kinsey shone a light on the so-called forbidden topic and made everyone realize that we're not all the same, and there are great variables in human sexuality. Wife Clara should also get a lot recognition for her total support, and for caring and watching over their family and his projects. Laura Linney was outstanding in this role, as was Liam Neeson playing Kinsey, a superb actor. Much of the research led us into the '60's and '70's, and this new open approach to one of our natural impulses. Good movie."
9913,1,ggreat,Interesting look at how far our sexuality research has come due to work of kinsey . some parts may make people uncomfortable. we need shaking up every now and then .
9922,1,terrific!,my kids and I have viewed this MANY times since we received it. my only complaint is the variability in sound quality - very hard to hear the first part.
9927,1,don't you love Andrew Lloyd Webber?,"this is a great video produced by the composer of the music of this musical.I enjoyed the Phantom, Love never dies, and Joseph. It tells the biblical story of Jacob and his many sons and the conflict with joseph. We only recognised two songs here in Australia as I don't remember this musical coming here. For lovers of music and spectacles this video is well worthwhile."
9932,1,Joseph entertains wonderfully!,"I ordered this video to use as a wrap-up for a unit I was doing on musicals with my 3rd and 4th graders. They really enjoyed watching it and absolutely loved the music. For many, this was their first exposure to a musical. There were some parts where the women were very ""scantily clad"", and that, of course, got a big reaction out of them - I reassured them that the actresses were wearing costumes to make them ""look like they're not wearing anything."" Even being a pro actor myself, I have little criticism for this video."
9936,1,Looks just like our real black lab,Gave this to my wife on Valentines day to put at her work office to have to reminder her of our real black lab Shelby. She loves it.
9947,1,A great horror Movie,"I thought this was a great movie. If you are into horror movies, this one is a must. The movie does a good job at letting you feel what is going on in everyones mind. I cannot think of anything really negative about this movie, and would definitely suggest it for anyone who loves horror movies."
9952,1,texas chainsaw,"If anyone asks, I did know that this wasn't really based on a true story. Anyway, I finally saw this orginal last night. I liked it enough. My fav. part was at the end when the girl went all crazy like and jumped out the window while being chased by the family. i laughed. The re-make of this film was really different and i think i liked it more. Latherface was cool looking and the rest of the crazy family were interesting as well."
9962,1,Top Notch,"This film is shot well, has a great soundtrack, and is definitely a great early piece by Scorsese. There's no real obvious plot line, but it's still a fun movie."
9966,1,"Great help, couldn't have written the website without it.",This is the first of the dummies series of books I have used. I read it from cover to cover and practised before I started on my real website. I then used the book as a reference and found it extremely helpful. The website is now published. Some sections were basic formatting that I already knew so I just skimmed over these sections but on the whole a great help.
9970,1,Not A Sequel- A Stand Alone Movie,"Wes Craven said in an interveiw that this movie isn't a sequel to ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" but instead a movie seperate from that franchise almost entirely- except for the character of Freddy. He is correct because the Elm Street series were fictitious movies in this movie. Heather played Heather and Wes played Wes, who by the way was writing another Elm Street movie in this one. So it isn't a sequel. Its an original. A movie where a fictitional character comes to life. Some people might be upset because this movie is saying that everything in the Elm Street series is fictional but why? This is entirely seperate from the series and this should be taken into consideration. A very creative effort."
9985,1,Pretty Darn Good!,"Lot's of fun! I don't agree with the criticisms of the lyrics - they are for adults. If you like this stuff, also check out Joe Jackson's ""Jumpin' Jive"" from almost 20 years ago (as well as the originals, of course)."
9987,1,Another tenn pop star,"Admittedly, ""Another Dumb Blonde"" isn't half bad. It is catchy but it has a bonus: Hoku doesn't sound as bad as Britney Spears. Thanfully, she doesn't growl like Mandy Moore does sometimes which is rather a blessing. Hey, at least she can sing. And if she has learnt the lesson of Jessica's and Mandy's failes outings, there's no reason why she can't be as successful as Britney or Christina."
9988,1,DUMB BLONDE? I dOn'T ThInK sO.,"If you like music, you'll like this. Full of beat and jive, it will make you want to go and get it fast."
9989,1,"a ""teen fluff"" song - but a pretty good one","""Another Dumb Blonde"" is a pretty decent song - to be sure it's teen fluff but there is nothing wrong with that - many of the all time great songs could also be considered ""teen fluff"" - it does fit the standard formula for this material in many ways, but it is less saccarhine than much of Britney's , Christina's, and Mandy's material. Hoku has a pleasant voice, the video is well done, and she is lovely to look at. And since she is Don Ho's daughter, I wonder if there will be a teen version of ""Tiny Bubbles"" on her album."
9990,1,GED PRACTICE TESTS/ANSWER KEY FF,"I really like the book, especially how it goes over the basics, and breaks things down real easy for you. Especially the math portion.However, I do have a question in regards, to the ""Answer Keys"" for the GED Practice Tests. First; the answers that it gives to coincide with the practive tests (especially ""answer key for FF for writing section 1"") isn't making since. Second; the answers for the ""writing section"" are 27 and the actual questions for that section is 28. The rest of the answers keys match up with the questions. I haven't gone over those sections yet. Please reply as I am studying and preparing to take my GED test in April. I've waited a long time to do this, and just want to be sure that I study all the right materials. Thank you."
9994,1,A movie series of the books,Marvelous books! I've seen a series of French films bases on the series of Angelique books when I was a child. They made such impression that I have been looking for Angelique books and video tapes. Has anyone come across the tapes?
10002,0,Better than I thought.,"I wrote a harsh review based on hearing a couple of tracks from one album,but after hearing tracks from the other 3 albums,I have to say that I take it back and in fact I bought it.The other albums are very good value for money with good liner notes and some very good music.Well worth the money for Roy Orbison fans."
10003,0,The great Roy Orbison deserves a better quality recording .,"When I saw the term 'bootleg' on the title of this recording,I can see what they mean because one cd does have a slightly disappointing sound,but the others do sound much better.Having seen the great Roy Orbison twice live in concert,I know that he sounded better,but overall it is a good value for money 4cd set with good liner notes."
10011,0,ADVENTURE NEEDS MORE!!,"I thought this was a good game. However it was really short, and that made it not as enjoyable as I was hoping it would have been.Overall is a good game but it needs a longer storyline to it!"
10025,0,Singer writes scary stories,"""The Seance"" is a collection of short stories. It portrays the lives of Jewish characters in Eastern Europe between the wars.I found the book a little hard to read. Singer paints his characters so clearly, you can actually smell them. That is sometimes too hard to take. I saw my grandmother in his pictures and it wasn't to pleasant."
10027,0,"Undecided on product, but Electro Island is A+++ customer service!","I currently have this item for my S/E z500a phone. Though it doesn't seem to work yet, I will say that Electro Island is working with me on a daily basis to get it up and running...More to follow. This vendor has some of the best and most polite service I've encountered from an online purchase."
10031,0,"Not so great, but not a terrible product","It's a nice length and width, but it's very loud when it's on (you can't hear it if you have a fan/tv on and it's under the covers, but other wise, people can hear it through the door) and it seems like most of the vibrating power is on the ""handle"" rather than any other point along it.It's an okay item for the price, but it's not the best out there. You won't be horribly disappointed if you buy it, but you're not missing anything spectacular by passing it up."
10037,0,It's okay but........,"My 7 year old got this for her birthday recently. She wanted this really bad and I thought I wouldn't be able to get her off the computer once she started. She's only played it about 4 or 5 times in the last month. She enjoys it when she's playing but once you've put on a show, there's not any challenge left. Not the worst computer game we've bought but it could have been far better!!"
10039,0,three sisters to die for.......,"Once started I couldn't put it down, literally. I didn't stop til I'd read it through.Three sisters on the run from the Night Worlds patriachal society, they visit Oregon. Their brother finds out where they are and tries to drag them back, except for a few minor details he has it all figured out. 1. someone else knows where the girls are and if Ash doesn't bring them back, Quinn will bring in the authorities. 2. Ash has found his soulmate Mary-Lynette who also knows their secret identity. 3. someone killed their aunt and they don't know who, is it a vampire hunter or someone who knows the truth.The vampires are in danger and Ash and Mary-Lynette have fallen in love. END"
10042,0,"Great Song, But...","""Chocolate"" was the best song on Ms. Minogue's Body Language album, but this single gives you a truncated version. It's shorter, with some added effects. It looses a lot of the flow which makes the album version so memorable. The bonus track, ""City Games"" is nothing noteworthy, and the ""Chocolate"" remixes just further dimishish the orginal song. The live version of ""Love At First Sight"" is alright, but Kylie is not great to listen to live. On the positive side, the enhanced video is very stylish. That is the only reason to buy this single."
10043,0,not interesting enough for little ones,"I wish I had read the other reviews before buying this particular video. My two year old does not have any interest in the between episode segments where parents and kids talk about their feelings for Thomas. I think it may have mads an interesting documentary for older kids who had liked Thomas as small children but for little kids, it does not hold their interest long enough to get to the next story. Perhaps if the video allowed you to skip the segments or turn them off like the producer notes in movies, it would be a nicer experience."
10059,0,Nice but...,"This bench was easy to put together but was a two person job. It is a beautiful accent to our yard but I don't like the fact that is has a really short swing to it. Still, I believe we will get years of enjoyment out of it."
10072,0,"Great camera, but missing important feature","This is a great camera. We use it a lot. I love the night shot, the steady shot works great and it has a lot of other nice features. Everything on it works great all the time. The light metering and auto focus work very well too.There is only one problem that really frustrates me. It has a right and a left microphone and records in stereo, but there is no way to get stereo playback through the analog A/V output. That's certainly one of the cheapest things I've seen in products that I've bought. It's very disapointing from a name like Sony."
10087,0,Suspenseful but uneventful ending,"I enjoyed it very much particularly the written skills in describing the characters and the crime scenes. However, I was not convinced about the ending since it did not explain about why Temple Gault was challenging Dr.Scarpetta. Perhaps a book on his adolescent and how he develops an emotional attachment to Kay would be interesting."
10089,0,Predictable but Good,"Most of the story you could have guessed at and unless you were deaf, dumb and blind you were not really shocked as to how the story ended.Still not a bad little book. I would recommend it. I still like Dr. Kay even after all this time."
10092,0,Good...up until the end!,"I was really into this book and was having a hard time putting it down. But the end left me totally unstatisfied. I felt that it was rushed and really left no closure, almost like there were pages misssing from my book that would compliment the story. It was as if the author was faced with constraints in time or space. Great story line...bad ending."
10097,0,Set your expectations before you buy this,"The value of this book depends on what you expect out of it. I bought this book so I can get a good idea about basic economics in general not about government economic policies. But this book essentially goes about picking one government policy after another (like tax cuts, protection of industries, price fixations, minimum wage etc) and goes about telling us why such artificial measures are not right and why the economy should in general be left to free market forces.As such, the book was a kind of disappointment for me - in not meeting my requirements. Though I should say that by itself, the contents of the book are quite good and generally enlightening."
10098,0,A Political pamphlet all the way,"This book seems to be a political pamphlet, all the way. I like the narrative approach though. Too much anger at the government I guess. Analysis please. Reader will draw their own conclusions."
10100,0,Ho-hum,"Mr. Hazlitt had some good points to offer, but there were two things that were diminishing: much of his content was dated (written a half-century ago) and he dwelt on certain issues in far too much detail. I was disappointed."
10101,0,Biased / not a general intro to economics,"If you want someone to argue against Keynes, then this book is for you. I know enough to know that economic stimulus during a recession is considered reasonable by many (but not all) economists."
10103,0,My review will be forthcoming if or when I receive this prod,I placed my order for this picnic table on July 24 and as yet have not received it.Just keep getting up dated delivery dates.
10108,0,Not too bad but a bit uncomfy,"This isn't too bad and stays on pretty well but after some time the ribbing can dig into your skin at the top and bottom and leave red marks. I wear it with a cami underneath and that definitely helps if I wear it long. Size wise I have a 28"" waist and I got the small which on the first set of hooks is tight but not uncomfortably so. It does a good job staying where it is and doesn't ride up or down, but it is not totally seemless nor does it always lay completely flat so itcan be seen under a tight fighting top or dress."
10111,0,I WILL PURCHASE,"THIS ITEM IS GOOD HOWEVER, AFTER WEARING AFTER ABOUT A MONTH YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE IT GETS REALLY OLD AND GETS TO BIG"
10112,0,Decent Product,"The product is good, I will wait for the final results to see if I get back in shape and loose some weight, but as of now, this is good and a decent product."
10113,0,Really holds you in!!,"For compression products, this one is pretty good. I would not recommend anyone wearing it during the summer because it does cause you to sweat. However, it is only slightly uncomfortable is good quality."
10123,0,Great except for one thing,"I bought this cincher a month after I had my second baby and it really did help. Anybody who's has just given birth should really wear one of these right after because it really helps shrink your waist. To get the best results, I would wear it all day at home and if I go out I would take it off because, depending on what I'm wearing, one might be able to see thru your clothes . One thing that I really didnt like is that a couple times of wearing it, it started to roll up and I really hated that. But cinchers are great over all but if you can find one that doesn't roll up then, that one is keeper. Thats why I gave it 3 stars because it does help and the material is good, it just rolls up."
10129,0,"Great, but not for long torsos","I purchased this corset (and make no mistake: it's a CORSET) after the birth of my second son. It took me a while to fit into a medium (I'm a size 8/10) but when I started using it, it certainly does what it says. Unfortunately, I am 6' tall and have a rather long torso, so it looks like I have extra back fat since everything gets squeezed up near the bra area. Ick! Also, the corset cinches together with a hook & eye system, which shows under clingy clothes, so beware. What's great about it is it really sucks it all in...like you're living in the 1700's, which honestly, I didn't mind in small doses. All around, I would LOVE this product if it came in a longer size. But, it doesn't, so only 3 stars from me. : ("
10131,0,Good product,This is a good product. It really does shape you instantly and beautifully. Make sure that you wear something underneath it (i.e. tank) or you will be left with some marks similar to what happened to me. Overall it is a good product...I haven't worn it long enough to see the lasting results.

10151,0,A cautionary tale.,"The Scarlet Letter is a catuionary tale set in a time with a very different moral code. This makes for fascinating reading at the start however, the writing style is so long-winded and introspective that it is not a particularly satisfying read. I wanted to fast forward through a lot of it to get to the action. The unusual characters in the story are well described and I liked the writers attempt to portray a ""fallen woman"" in a sympathetic light - and with unusual strength. I appreciated it for the insights, but won't be recommending it."
10152,0,The scarlet letter,The book had a lot of fluff in it. It was hard to understand mostly because it had a lot of symbolism.
10160,0,Depends on what you like...,"I had to read this book for English class, and I did not enjoy it. My favorite genre is scifi-technthriller, and this clearly is not it. However, although I had to force myself to flip to the next page, when we analyzed it in class the book was amazing. Hawthorne can be considered nothing less than a pure genius in his writing. We could easily spend 30 minutes talking about a single page in our class of 17. The amount of detail and hidden information is astonishing. So, if you like love stories, (which I think this can be considered), this is the book for you. Otherwise, buy a Tom Clany novel."
10162,0,It was ok.,"This book is very interesting! Unfortunately it's hard to understand. The version I read was Barnes and Noble Classics 2003, with notes by Nancy Stade. It's about how people deal with sin. What would you do if you were involved with adultery? Hester Prynne had to wear a scarlet A on her clothes as a mark of shame to ""purify"" her. Arthur Dimmesdale hid his secret for seven years, which tormented him with guilt. Roger Chillingsworth lived a bitter and revengeful life after the incident. I would recommend this book for people who can understand old English. It is a story with a good moral. It talks about confessing sin, the consequences of sin, and forgiving others. - Daniel W."
10166,0,A difficult read.,"On first glance, such a slim volume would seem to be something you could read quickly. Not so! The turgid and heavy prose is over-ornamented and complicated by ye olde New England Puritan syntax.I suspect that even when it was written Hawthornes prose was never accessible, and in the modern context it is so far from spoken english that reading it is like wading through treacle. It is sweet, cloying and ultimately sickening.The underlying story is simple, a universal enough theme to span the ages, and could easily be rewritten well into the modern context.It is never easy to be harsh with a book that is listed as a ""classic"" but in this case I feel I must be truthful about it. This is not an easy nor an enjoyable read. It is hard work. To be oxymoronic I suppose it is the heaviest light read and the fattest slim book I have encountered.Read it at your peril!"
10168,0,hated the daughter,"the daughter was a brat. as abusive as the puritans were they really dropped the ball when it came to her. seriously, what ever happen to "" better to beat the child then let them be damned by the devil""?. the story itself has some interesting ideas. such as if the ""A"" came from the inside out or the outside in. ultimately, because of the way you choose to answer that question, and who you apply that answer to , does make it a classic. over all, even with its interesting ideas, i didn't find it a very good read."
10169,0,The Scarlet Letter Review by Tazmania,"I think that the book was ok. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the fact that there wasn't enough talking amoung the characters in the book. Even though I couldn't understand some of the words in the book, I recommend this book to people who like a good, challenging book."
10174,0,"a rewarding, yet dragging book.","The scarlet letter is a book which skips around alot. Based in MASS. it is about adultury and how it affects everyone around who ever commited it. Hester Prynne falls in love with the reverand dimmesdale and end up having a daughter, pearl. The one problem is that Hester is married. She feels that it is ok to love dimmesdale due to her husbands rumored death. Soon her husband returns, very much alive, yet hidding the fact of being hesters husband. Hester is forced to wear a scarlet letter A, A standing for adultry, on her clothes for the rest of her life. This book was good, yet at times you get lost and there is much unneeded text in there. If the author was to take out much of the unnessecary text, then this book would be great.. nice story line."
10180,0,"Scarlette Letter, (Classic Collection Discs)",I am not reviewing the book itself but the disc. My teenager is dyslexic and is required to read this for high school. It would be so helpful if somewhere on the package we were told what chapters are on what discs.

10201,0,"Cute and handy lunch bag, fits everything","As our 15-month old eats more and more, we outgrew the small cold bag we'd used for smaller bottles and little bits of food. We went looking for a lunchbox that would hold 2 8-oz bottles as well as a couple of small food containers, as well as an ice pack or two. This lunchbox does the trick, and our son loves the animals.The only missing element, at least for me, is a shoulder strap - our smaller lunchbag has a short strap that we used to sling the bag around, which especially came in handy when loading kid and lunchbag and diaperbag and purse etc. onto an airplane. I think we can improvise one, but it won't be terribly elegant."
10214,0,5 stars for Paramount version; 1 star for Warner Bros version,"I write this assuming you already know the story A Charlie Brown Christmas. Be warned that the audio on the Warner Bros version is a half second ahead of the video. It is more noticeable on the sounds (tapping of the aluminum tree, tossing of the directors horn) than on the dialog. This seems to only apply to the Warner Bros DVD, and not the Blu Ray.I am not sure if I like the video on the Warner Bros either. It is a sharper image; but it also seems to be a negative quality.This is a Christmas special that people watch every year. If I knew then what I know now, I'd have purchased the Paramount version from http://www.amazon.com/Charlie-Brown-Christmas-Ann-Altieri/dp/B00004W5UM/ref=sr_1_3?s=dvd&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1291690784&sr;=1-3 .One more comment: The 'making of the Christmas special' is a nice feature that is included on the Warner Bros version."
10216,0,Extras a disappointment,"I purchased the streaming video version for $10. I only wanted Charlie Brown Christmas - 5 stars and worth the 10 bucks; it comes with two other shows - a 2nd version of Charlie Brown Christmas (3 stars) and something inane called ""Flash Beagle""... (0 stars). If you're going for the original Charlie Brown Christmas... you'll get that. You'll have to decide for yourself what you think of the other two items."
10217,0,Nice pillow for the first month,"I really liked this pillow at first. It was comfortable and just the right size. After a month, however, the pillow has lost a lot of its personality and has become pretty flat. Most pillows will crush down after time, so I can't really say I'm all that disappointed. However, for the price, I was hoping it was constructed out of more sturdy material."
10227,0,Does What It Supposed To Do,"You can read all the other reviews; I found them very helpful. I use this on my 12"" Aluminum PowerBook G4, 1.5GHz, 1.25 mb RAM. My only comment has to do with the difference in wattage between the Apple 65W rating and this charger's 45W. The lower wattage results in a longer battery charge time. Plus, if you operate the laptop when the battery is dead (plugged in, of course), the computer continually searches for the best power source, switching back and forth between battery and plug-in. This causes the screen to flicker between high and low brightness. When this happens, I let the battery get fully charged before using the laptop."
10238,0,Not what I expected,"Well I thought this would be a good addition to our concert dvd collection to listen to in our in home bar. While I love Queensryche, I have never seen them in concert and therefore was not aware their stage show is more like going to a play. I have gone to a lot of concerts and have not seen acting on stage. I guess some of you die hards like my husband expected it but it was distracting to me. It was hard to enjoy the beautiful, creative songs while watching such bad acting. And might I add that I felt as though ALL of the songs were lipsynched because the vocals were just too exact and sounded exactly the recorded versions. Bottom line, I would've rather played their cd's on my ipod than watch the heavy metal soap opera."
10239,0,Stick to singing Geoff,"Well, lets start with general impressions. Overall this is a good DVD. The sound is great and the video is great. The band pulls off both Mindcrime discs very well live. It's true that Geoff Tates voice has had better days, but he sounds a lot better on this than he did on Live Evolution. However, his acting leaves much to be desired. I don't know why he decided to sport the Madonna microphone and act out parts of the show. He kind of reminded me of Meat Loaf in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. But like I said, overall this is a great disc for Queensryche fans. I highly recommend it."
10240,0,Is it worth doing this for 90 days?,"Power 90 is one of the greatest workout DVDS. As a 15 year old, i would say that its a good way to get that body you want. ""Ab Ripper"" is one of the best exercises. ""Sculpt"" is a good exercise to get muscles in your arms and chest. ""Sweat"" is real dull. You can get the same results from kicking, punching, and dancing. But it still works out your calves effectivly.But one of the most annoying thing on this DVD is the commericals. Theres about 2 hours worth of ""so-called"" doctors pressuring to sell you vitamins that will help you get better results. As if i need more pressure... Also, is it worth doing the exercise every day for 90 days? But anyways, its a good DVD to get great results.(P.S. I think Tony Horton is obsessed with people sweating. You'll see what i mean if you buy this DVD.)"
10243,0,An open and open case,"If you are a fan of murder mysteries, then you must read Van Dine, who was a pivotal figure in the development of that genre. Unfortunately, if you are a longtime fan, this particular story will seem rather feeble. You will guess the general form of the solution very early on. But, it is of its time. When it was written, both the plot and the writing style would have been fresh and original. Now, it is a period piece. It gives fascinating insights into American 1920s society, and shows where the early Ellery Queen came from.Recommended for serious fans of the genre, but don't expect a 'never would have guessed it' moment.[PeterReeve]"
10245,0,Almost there,"It was worth the price. The wood is nice enough. The dimensions are inaccurate, however: it is actually 14.5 inches deep - not 11.5 as featured. I purchased it because it was for a drawer that is only 12 inches deep. I am able to use it in another drawer, so all ends well. The construction method involved the use of staples that promptly popped out after a little stress - so I hammered in a couple of fine finishing nails to replace them and it works just fine."
10247,0,it is a product of when it was written,"i think that this book has to be understood as, first and foremost, a women's studies title and also very much a product of when it was written. also of the times that the author is actually recounting, which was in the 60s/70s/80s. if you keep that context, then i think a lot of what it is criticized for is more understandable. it's dated. it could be deeper. and, yes, the author does come over as a bit self-focused. but it's not the worst account out there, either. worth borrowing from the library?"
10250,0,Good authors abismal editors,"There are some good short stories in here that explore some interesting concepts. Others are poor and need some more work. All in all the fiction is good and worth getting but the editing is atrocious. This book is riddled with countless mistakes and misprints that should have been picked up by any half competent editor. None of them get in the way of the stories and it is always clear what the author meant. So the book is still worth buying unless little things like ""petal"" instead of ""pedal"" annoy you. In that case steer well clear of this book."
10254,0,Better Than I thought,I purchased this book because my book club was reading it. It looked pretty lame at first. It turned out to have some useful information in it. It is a good resource item to have in your bookcase. I was originally going to take it to the used bookstore when the bookclub was done with it. I ended up keeping it for future reference.

10267,0,Castle in the attic reveiw,This book showed how sometimes imagination can make a really interesting reality. Being fiction and all we thought it was very interesting. It was very intriguing and we didn't want to put the book down. It was full of magic fantasy and challenges for the characters to face. This book is a good read-a-loud book great for class room discussions. We thought it was interesting how they described the forest when William was traveling to defeat Alastar. Two thumbs up!(...)
10275,0,Not what I was expecting!,"OK, just got the game last week, and I was soooo excited, but started to play, and was a little disappointed when I found her so hard to control. And what is with the slow motion? Every once in a while it looks like instant replay during your game play, either this, or Laura is severely tired and has to slow down. What's the deal? Also, the camera angles are a little difficult to get used to, I am still adjusting. The graphics are great, but I think a little more work should have been done on the controls; she is just too difficult to move sometimes. Jumping is not the same anymore, and why must she walk before she starts to run? Before it was straight out running, and now, she has to take about 3 or 4 steps before she starts running. I am still hanging in there; I believe it must get better. I am still playing, so I guess I will just have to adjust to the ""new and supposedly improved"" Laura."
10276,0,Small washer for small jobs,"Bought new @ Menards, used several times to clean screened in room floor, garage floor, wash car & truck. Works good on small jobs. Biggest complaint: the cheap plastic hose connector broke shortly after using & sounds like a common problem many have had. Checked online for replacement part @ $1.39 but shipping costs more than the part! Think I'll check my local hardware store for a universal hose connector if there is such a thing. Too bad a cheap broken part makes the washer totally unusable."

10278,0,Worth watching...,"...okay first of all it is supposed to be a vampire movie, but the vampires act more like zombies. They bite the hell out of any and all bodyparts, they walk like they're zombies, and act like they are zombies. This movie was not bad, except they over did it with the blood. Too much of it is not always a good thing, and it gets old after a while. I would say this is about a three and a half star movie. It is a good addition to your horror library, but not an integral one. I would say rent it first, then if you feel it justifies a purchase then by all means. I don't regret I got it, but I wish I could tell you it is a must have."

10335,0,Good Remote Control Features,"This is a good general-purpose tripod for Sony Handicams. The remote control handle is a must-have feature for decent videos. With practice, slow zooms are possible.My biggest complaint is that the unit does not have a fluid head. It can be hard to get smooth pans without some jerkiness.However, the overall features and utility of the remote handle and a reasonable price, make this a good buy."
10344,0,Doesn't consistenly keep good connection,"For some reason the power plug seems to be just a little off in size. Doesn't consistently supply power unless it is held in just the right position. Luckily, the USB connector and the power plug are connected by such a short cord that when the USB connector is plugged in then it pulls the power plug to where it needs to be. Works either plugged directly into Karma or plugged into the dock."

10349,0,"A Visual Treat, But Needs More Content","I enjoyed what there was in this book, but the generous use of white space and extended discussion on how to make your own books left little room for the subjects of most interest to me, namely the appearance of artists' journals and suggestions for making visual enhancements to a a journal.The ideas there are very fine, indeed, but for the price and number of pages I simply expected more ideas. I'd recommend checking this book out of the library rather than actually purchasing it. I don't think it will grow on one as a reference."
10351,0,"It's worth watching, but...","I have to admit I was a little disappointed in this movie but considering it was a first it wasn't a bad attempt. We did get a few laughs, but not as many as I had hoped for.All three of my children are die-hard old comedy movie buffs and this one only held the attention of the oldest (14-year-old). The other two drifted off to more interesting activities.I'll definately watch it again but it'll never rank in my top favorites I'm sorry to say."

Her scene is smoking hot, and is awfully close to hardcore porn...It's fun to watch late at night, and is so typically 1970's.It's OK. 3 stars."
10369,0,Super cute but doesn't last,"Positives: This costume is extremely cute and my five year old daughter LOVES it. She even won 2nd place in a costume contest.Negatives: The mask is meant to be tight fitting and has elastic to pull it tight. The downside is that the material is so flimsy that the mask began to tear within about 5 minutes. This was a size medium and she is a very small five year old. Regarding sizing, the package says ""medium (u.s.a. size 8 - 10) for 5 - 7 years."" Well that makes perfect sense. The washing instructions are also interesting: ""Wipe clean with damp cloth. Line dry. Do not wash. Do not bleach. Do not iron. Do not dry clean."" That's nice. A costume you can't iron that arrives with a million wrinkles. A costume for a child that says ""Do not wash."" Obviously I don't need to add that it was made in China."
10377,0,Misleading title,"I LOVE Julia, let me say that and have been devouring everything I can find about her. I was very disappointed, however, that the title of this is misleading. I thought SHE would be baking, but it's a series of other people baking and she is standing next to them. I got a copy from the library, wanted to check it out before I bought it and am sure glad I did because I will pass on it. Actually, some of what I remember was contrary to techniques she taught on her videos--the people in the video used different techniques, so if you remember some of hers it will seem a little confusing. Just seemed like an attempt to keep her in front of the camera but really isn't about her."
10384,0,One sided,A mediocre historian. Most of the facts he quotes based on one diary. For whatever reasons he trusts more the Nazi published facts and numbers then Soviets. The good news is that unlike the other books he describes in detail the Luftwaffe war.
10388,0,great but disc was scratched,I got this as a Valentines Day gift for my fiance he LOVES spiderman. However the 2nd disc wasn't packaged right & was loose inside the case resulting in scratches! So of course it doesn't play right. Was a bit disappointed.
10390,0,"Neither earth-shattering, nor an easy read.","When this book came in from the library, my first thought was, ""wow...finally...some serious scholarship on the subject."" And while this work is eminently cited in many books on its subject, it's neither an easy read nor particularly ground breaking in the arguments it makes and the history it provides.Now I should say I am no stranger to books published by academic presses, however, readability does matter to me and I just did not find it very accessible as a person overwhelmed in academic reading.In short, if someone was searching for a brief, realistic, and readable history of Wicca and Witchcraft, I would suggestBonewits's Essential Guide to Witchcraft and Wicca, which covers much of the same ground (history of witchcraft in ancient, pre-modern, and modern times and the development of Wicca) in much more readable but still serious tone and style."
10397,0,Good but not great,"I agree with the other reviewers when they say From One is a better album. Don't get me wrong, this is a decent effort, but I feel like if you were to rate all these songs on a scale of 1-10, almost all these songs would be around a 7. ...Good, but not high enough to the point that the disc will still be getting regular play in your CD player 6 months to a year from now."
10399,0,"That'll do Ra, That'll do","Keeping in mind that Ra isn't too highly complex, I think it is safe to say that this was a pleasant surprise. Still even though I feel that they need to get the gears moving in order to escape the fate of all Nu-Metal bands. They are a very well balanced band that brings some good lyrics and musicianship and with the remake of ""Every Little Thing She Does is Magic"", I was pleased for the money spent."
10401,0,I thought it wasn't as good as the other Night World books,It wasn't as good as the other books in the series. I enjoyed Daughters of Darkness the most so far. I have bought every Night World novel that has been released and can't wait for new ones.
10414,0,Aquired taste,"I didn't like this album that much at first, but it grew on me. I got this CD as a gift, listened to it once and threw it a side. I decided to give it a second chance and it really grew on me as I listened to it more and more. The singing at times gets on my nerves, but I like a lot of the songs. The lyrics are the best part of this album. ""Fire Fire"" and ""Amazon"" are my to favorite songs. Some of the electronica is interesting, and she does not sound like anyone."
10418,0,mixed reviews,I have had a set of 8 blue colorwave for at least three years now. I love the square salad plates and the bowls have held up great. The plates seem to be the problem. Some of the plates are not molded the same and will not stack nicely. Utensil scratches are the biggest problem. Originally one or two plates were very bad that we only used them when we had to. Now they are all developing scratches. I will be looking for a new set of dishes soon. Maybe I should avoid stonewear.
10420,0,"Great music, horrible mastering","Wishmaster is one of my favorite Nightwish albums. However, I was always disappointed with the insanely high dynamic range compression and distortion on the CDs. So I thought why not try the LP instead - with any luck it'll have a completely different master. Unfortunately, it seems like all they did was apply the RIAA curve to the CD and cut it into vinyl.If you're buying this for the collector's value then great, but if you actually want to listen to it don't bother and just stick with the CD instead."

I recommend a subscription to my friends, family and people who want to borrow my copy. The staff, writers and contributors are top notch. Most of the articles are educational, conscious raising and encourages self-growth. The fashion, hair and beauty sections are well done with excellent photo's. As a whole, a subscription to ESSENCE magazine is well-worth the cost."

10454,0,Not impressed,"For the amount of time invested and money spent, this product did not live up to expectations. I will not re-order. I noticed very little change in my skin even tho I used it faithfully and according to directions."
10457,0,Okay but expected more,"I have been using this product for about three months now. At first, it really seemed to be making my skin tone more clear and radiant. But my main problem is oily skin and adult acne (which is worse at 37 than it was at 17). And MD hasn't helped that at all. My skin is still an oil slick, and I still get frequent breakouts. Dealing with my breakouts has started to really tick me off now that I am spending around $100 a month on the MD skincare system, versus the $10.00 or so I used to spend on Neutrogena or the like. But to give MD credit, I have cruddy skin - large pores, oily all over, etc. I like the clean feeling the pads give me but it just doesn't seem worth the cost anymore. So I am moving on. Going to try Nucelle."
10462,0,Great book on Jujutsu,This book is more useful as training reference for a Small-Circle Jujitsu practioner as while the principle of the small circle is quite interesting and so is Wally Jay's history the book really doesn't cover many principals of grappling in depth.The best books to get to understand the grappling arts isThe Canon of Judo: Classic Teachings on Principles and TechniquesandTotal Aikido: The Master Course (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior)as these books go into the details and strategy of grappling arts where as this book is more for advanced practioners.
10464,0,Small Circle or Kodenkan Yawara ?,"I did not find what I was looking for here. I was hoping to find an entire book on ""Small Circle JuJitsu"" and instead found a book that was 80-90% standard Kodenkan JuJitsu at maybe the Shodan Level and only 10-20% of what I would consider ""Small Circle JuJitsu"". I was 20% satisfied and left feeling empty. Maybe I just lack the experience to understand what his two books convey? But I don't think so!"
10466,0,disappointing,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book since it came so highly recommended by a trusted book catalogue. On the positive side, the book gives an interesting account of the historical struggle between the rich coffee plantation owners and the uprising of the poor Indian workers. However, the author fails, in my opinion, in developing her characters beyond the superficial, and thus I remained uninvolved for the most part and detached from all the human tragedies. In summary, Ms Benitez had a wonderful premise for a story, and the history and description of El Salvador are enlightening and in part very beautiful, but the plot and characters ultimately remain shallow and mimick the sub-plot soap opera."
10467,0,Love Stories,"I enjoyed reading tales of others who were being romantic. Although I was a bit disappointed by the lack of creativity or originality in most of the vignettes. If you are wanting help being romantic, skip this book. If you are looking for a feel good experience, reading about other happy couples, you might enjoy it."
10474,0,Simple,"This book was not anything special. Although I love romances, it was too simple. The symbolism was spelled out to the readers in a blunt manner. The less educated readers may appreciate it. The wording was quite beautiful at times and the plot was enchanting (perfect for a movie) but it is not heart wrenching like the movie Titantic (which was a must see!) ;)"
10476,0,Sad classic novel,"This is a classic novel that is one of the saddest. It involves a very likeable, innocent country girl who is seduced by a cruel employer. She has a child by that union that dies early in infancy. She later meets a man who loves her but upon learning her past rejects her. She then meets up again with the first man, who forces her to be his mistress. The ending is very sad.Through it all Tess maintains her dignity and is a very likeable character. This novel shows the extreme cruelty of legalistic morality that is not tempered by compassion and respect for others, particularly women during this time period.The book is very well written if you like poetic descriptions and vivid imagery. Hardy is a master of both, and of the human drama."
10480,0,sad story,"I am finding Thomas Hardy a great writer that I dislike. I plan on reading everything he wrote because his stories are very interesting and complex. However, I do not like most of his endings as the tend to involed the deaths of major characters in his works. In this story Tess has a very hard and sad life, that ends with her being hang for murder. All through the story I kept hoping that at some point she would find happiness or at least peace with herself. instead her situation kept getting more and more complacted and depressing. No matter what she did fate was out to deny her any hope of a nice fulfilling life. Finally she accepts death and escapes her suffering. Gloomy book but well worth reading."
10481,0,"Insightful in parts, ridiculously contrived in others","I had been meaning to read Tess for years and finally did this past week. I was mainly disappointed. The book starts off well...but it seems that 2/3 or so of the way through, the author became rushed....and the story becomes so slapdash and contrived I could not believe in the situations and definitely could no longer believe in the characters.The second quarter of this book, when Tess is at the dairy farm, is the strongest part. Hardy slows down; we believe in the characters and most of the emotions, and there is some wisdom and beautiful writing to be found here.After this point, it is, sadly, all downhill... I kept throwing up my hands in disgust."
10484,0,A good writer,"Like many people in Japan this book was recommended to me but I didn't want to read it. A friend gave me a copy and eventually I read it.The author gets so many things wrong about Japan that I wonder if he really spoke as much Japanese as he suggests. I often found my self scoffing at his opinions and explanations. It seems this was the end of his Japanese experience as he has gone on to write books on other topics.He also strikes me as quite a loner, if this is the summary of his social interaction he must have had a lonely time, which on the JET Programme is not uncommon.However he has a very good writing style which makes up for a lot of his failures. I'd suggest reading it and enjoying his perspective but be wary of his explanations."
10485,0,Interesting at least,"This book is well-written and flows very well. However, some of the events in the book and the way that they are described are too ""black and white"" for my tastes. A good read, but if you are considering teaching or living in Japan, take this book with a grain of salt."
10497,0,Read if you want to hear the stories others won't tell you.,"Of course, the reason others won't tell you those stories may be because the stories are patently false. I was looking for a book that would be a good read after ""Collapse"" -- something that would tell me about fallen civilizations. This isn't that book -- at least not from a rigorous, scientific approach. The author, for example, asserts that pterodactyls live in today's Arizona.The author believes that traditional academics are dismissing the truth because it doesn't fit in with their preconceived notions. The only reason I didn't rate this book lower is that it is clearly a great source for others who feel the same way. The rest of us, however, need to look elsewhere for scientifically grounded speculation into North American prehistory."
10498,0,outdoors but not impressed,"jack kerouac came recommended by several presumably legitimate sources however, after reading the dharma bums i may have to think twice the next time these people offer up others. while i myself am an avid hiker and can relate to the sections in this book dealing with such senarios the book as a whole seemed to drag. there were some scenes which had much potential to be captivating such as when a friend's girlfriend committs suicide, but kerouac fails to really emphasize. overall i rate this book 3 stars because of the subject/genre of book that it is but i have read much better authors. not impressed."
10506,0,Completing the Collection,"I bought this to keep my collection of Transformer movies intact. I found the setup for the plot a little slow going. I rate this as the third in the series should be rated. The fantasy is a little too fantastical. The action not quite up to snuff. The new girlfriend has the eye candy on her side, but the mystique is missing. The returning characters did their part in upholding the imagination of the film. I did not see this in the theater, thank goodness. It is worth watching again but not one for the ages."
10510,0,Not Great but not horrible,"I didn't see it in theatres - just when it came out on blu-ray. The story is about what you would expect of a Transformers movie and of course lots of CGI. The main complaint I have is the girl that replaced Megan Fox. I'm not a fan of Megan Fox, but this new girl was just awful as an actor and the character was equally as bad. At least with Megan Fox's character and acting you could believe that she would thrive in those perilous situations (and without running around in super high heels and always bright white clothes the whole time.)Other than that one complaint, I would say the rest of it was on par with what you would expect from this type of summer blockbuster!"
10515,0,Love the movie,"I didn't realize when I made the purchase that I would not be getting the jacket with the movie. It came in just a plastic disc cover. The movie works, but there is no resale value or collector value without the jacket."
10523,0,Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"This movie suffers the same imperfections as the review I did on The Three Musketeers. The movie is a fun movie to watch, watching it in 3D makes it even better. The quality of the movie is suspect, it has several flaws, there are scenes that fade out, and a couple black drop outs, it only last a couple seconds but takes away from the overall viewing of the movie itself, this is why I didn't give the 5 stars I think it deserves. Whatever company put this movie to disc need to check their master copy for flaws."
10526,0,Fairly Good,The only problem is when you replace the original cast it loses it`s basis. Not to mention what happened to the original girl. She should have been in it or at least showed a breakup. Otherwise a great film. Can you imagine Spock or bones being replaced? How about all those robots on Lost In Space and Star Wars being replaced? Or the princess being substituted for a sleep around slut?
10528,0,better than expected,Surprisingly good movie. I didn't expect it to be this good. I liked the special effects and the growth of the main character.
10531,0,Pure Entertainment,"I watch these movies (Transformers) for entertainment mainly. The acting is somewhat subpar. I did like that the parents made an appearance, they were very funny. I didn't really miss Megan Fox, but the new girl didn't add to much to the movie either. The action was very good as were the scenes, but I felt they could have shaved at least 30 minutes off the movie and still came out with the same results. I did think the beginning of the movie was more interesting than the end."
10541,0,archaic book,i wonder why nobody has reviewed this book. i think it because it has not been read in many years.it makes me think of a popular cooky.
10549,0,Some flaws....,"The Sony Emarker is a good idea, but it needs some flaws worked out first. But first, the Pros. 1.Long battery life 2.Again, it's a really good idea. 3.Very compact-fits in your pocket well.The Cons! 1.The keychain is low quality. It broke after 2 weeks. 2.You usually have to wait a day to find out what your song is. 3.The ""mark"" button is very easy to get pressed while in your pocket. 4.You have to lesten to 1 station. This is a lot worse than it sounds. 5.Sometimes, Sony won't have the song you want. 6.Only some of the songs have clips so you can recognize your song. Without this you can't know what song you marked. 7.There are many stations you can't choose to have as your station. Make sure to check this before you buy this. Goto www.emarker.com to check for coverage. 8.Major Problem! If you do not install the Emarker in the order the instructions say to, you will have some major problems!Overall....I think you should wait for a new and better model. Bye!Bradley"
10554,0,No water sound,"With the step fountain there is no water fountain noise, maybe a good thing for some people. I wanted to hear the water effects for my office but this didn't make any noise, but its nice to look at. I'm going to try the rock style fountain."
10558,0,Good read for the price,"I thought this collection was ace! The one set in the museum was the best. It was kind of creepy and sad in parts but has a very interesting story and the end explains a lot. If you have kids, they will like this one too.I did not like so much ""M.C. Higgins the Great"" which I thought was more for boys. I didn't read this one though so I don't know what it's about except for the first five pages.For all your parents out there my Mom liked ""From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankwiler"" as well. If you liked reading you will like this even if you are any age at all.I am still reading ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimth"",I also recomend ""When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit"" in another book."
10563,0,Sizing off,"These seemed like good quality boots, however the sizing was 1/2 a size off. I ended up returning the product so I can't speak for actual comfort or longevity of product. But it is frustrating when a product doesn't fit. Shoes are usually pretty constant too. I purchased these particular ones based on all the great reviews but I didn't see any that commented on sizing issues, so just beware."
10566,0,Not for me,"Very comfortable boots. Actually make you want to walk. But forget about being waterproof. Its very temporary. This was my fourth pair. They all have leaked, and soon after wearing. If they could solve this problem, I would buy again."

10582,0,Book Review,"This is a most interesting, well thought out book. It give good, concise details of 9/11 events. However I think it lacked depth and could have been more detailed about what is next in terms of Port Security. More emphasis neede to be placed on this area. Worth the money, overall I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend theis book"
10583,0,Very Basic. Good Summary,The book has a very basic and elementary level. Probably this is due to the great array of topics it includes. It is a very high level overview of risk management concepts. Good reading for the weekend.
10588,0,Where's the liner notes,I'd rather buy the UK version because it has removed (Most) of the liner notes and some lyrics are removed using a bleeping thing
10601,0,Be Careful of the Edition,"Isaac Asimov was one of the greatest science fiction minds of the twentieth century. He was NOT, however, a great writer. At times it is difficult to separate the brilliance and scope of his imaginative ideas from the pedestrian and awkward manner in which he presents them.""Foundation,"" the first novel in the ever-lengthening Foundation series, is a collection of short stories originally published in ""Astounding"" magazine. The first couple are very good, but the last few are pretty uninteresting. The writing is uneven, dialogue is unrealistic, and characters are wooden and one-dimensional. And yet, through Asimov's wonderfully creative idea of psychohistory and its use in saving a dying Galactic Empire, this series became one of the best science fiction stories of all time, and well worth reading.Do be careful which edition you read. I read the Del Ray paperback edition, and I have never seen so many typographical errors in a published book."
10603,0,A classic ... good thing it's short.,"Let's face it: Isaac Asimov was not a very good writer, especially this early in the game. We read 'Foundation' not because we are interested in reading some fantastic literature but because the ideas in this little book became the tropes that have thrived in science fiction even to this day. If you're interested in sci-fi, 'Foundation' is a must-read.The importance of 'Foundation' in the genre may force us to allow for the blandness of its prose; however, it does not excuse it. The characters are ciphers, the style is blunt and ugly, like a sledgehammer, and there are plenty of minor but annoying infelicities of grammar. It's a good thing the novel is pleasantly short; whatever Asimov's faults, long-windedness was not one of them."
10606,0,"Pleasant SF outing, but little more.","Three stars is a bit generous, but this certainly isn't a bad book. In fact, it is easy to read, always interesting, and often exciting. But that's all it is. It is not deep or meaingful. It is not profoud. It is not thought provoking. It isn't even particularly well written. But it's so easy to take and has enough good qualities that it can't be disliked.The plot center's around the creation of a Foundation, a place where mankind's accumulated knowledge can be protected from the approaching collapse of civilization. This is an interesting enough premise and very original in its day, but the blending of mathematics and psychology into a science that can accurately predict much of the future is hard to take seriously.If you come across a copy of this book, read it. It won't take long and you'll probably enjoy much of it even if your not a SF fan, but I don't recommend anyone by this book. There is to much out there that is much much better."
10607,0,A classic appropriate for scifi newcomers & series lovers,"First, I read quite a bit from all genres, primarily to expand my world. Foundation is a very good series, but here's a few reasons why this book might not expand *your* world: 1) you were a statistics/religion/philosophy major in college (it may annoy); 2) you want a book for entertainment, not to ponder (it may bore); 3) you really think character development is important in a book (it spans generations, hence little/no development); 4) You're already a scifi buff (most of the books you've read have already assimilated the ideas of Foundation -- credit where due!). Biggest reason to read: its robust, well-crafted universe. Other tidbits: I've tried to read this series a second time, but it can't sustain my interest quite like other 5-star selections."
10614,0,color ink cartridge,"I've had this printer for about a year. About every 3 months I need to change the color ink cartridge when I don't even use it. I've called support and they didn't help me at all. I changed the black ink and when I print something, nothing comes out on the paper. On the printer it shows 3 circles on top and 4 on the bottom. I can't keep buying color ink cartriges every 3 months. What do I need to do?"
10617,0,International perspective,"This is going the the review from Arizona who noted that these songs are actually from 2001-2002. It's definitly a good catch, but you have to realize that this is an import... that is, these songs were probably not released overseas until much later (at least several months) than in the U.S. So, in reality, calling them songs from 2002 is probably completely accurate...not from your perspective, but it probably is from where this disc was produced.Think outside the box... Think outside the U.S."

10625,0,Didn't see the original but this one is ridiculous,"1. Glorifies drugs and corruption. Maybe that's how it is in NO, but it gets old seeing Cage act as bad as the criminals he pursues.2. Why does Cage sound like he has a wad of chaw or gum in his mouth during the middle part of the movie?3. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good. I guess that's all we get with free Amazon Prime, at least they added a couple new movies finally."
10631,0,Update to my previous review regarding motor noise.,"The high pitched motor noise is present in recordings, not only in very quiet situations (as my prvious review indicated, based on CanonDV site), but is also present when the camera is placed in front of speakers playing music.The above info is based on my playing two sample sound clips posted in a review at dvspot website by Jeff Keller.The persistant motor whine was VERY irritating and definately unacceptable.Since I love everything else about the ZR45/ZR50, I am now debating whether to buy it with the Canon DM-50 external mic for my upcoming vacation, or to wait until Spring/Summer 2003 and see if Canon fixes this problem in an upgraded model.Decisions, decisions, decisions!"

10644,0,Practical advise for setting up a woodworking shop,"I found this to be one of the better books I've seen about setting up shop. It showcases plenty of example shops and has some handy advise. However, like most books on this topic, it tries to cover all the possibilites - building a separate shop, working in a shed, basement, attic etc. and pertinent information for any one case is thus sparse. I'd like to see books specifically for conversion of a basement space or shed etc. into a shop, but I guess that would only add limitations on readership from a writer/publisher perspective."
10657,0,A Simple Wish for a Simple Mind,My children had seen this movie several years ago and remembered liking it. We purchased it and were surpirsed at how lame it was. Perhaps it was made for small children because older kids and adults will find the acting bad and the story too silly to enjoy.

10678,0,my opinion of this product,this product is ok i fill it up but it does lose a little air which makes it not stay firm
10679,0,Worked well for 90 days.,Worked well while it lasted. Honestly very satisfied until it failed at one of the seams and now has a huge bump on one side. Manufacturer says this product carries no warranty when amazon clearly states it does. Anyways Amazon took the product back for a 100% refund so I guess Im happy. Everyone keep in mind that this is not a long term solution.

10682,0,50/50,"I purchased two of these mattresses and am sorry to say that only one of them works as advertised. One arrived defective out of the box and had a pinhole leak somewhere that we could not identify. When we tried it before a trip it looked to hold up just fine, but even without any weight on it it was deflated after about 2 hours.The return process occurred without an issue, and the second mattress is fantastic, but I would strongly strongly strongly recommend heavily testing this before your first ""real"" use. At a minimum try to blow it up and see what it looks like in the morning, if there is any sign of loss of air, return it right away."
10699,0,HUGE,This product works as described but the girth on this toy is massive. NOT for beginners! Material is kinda of hard too.
10707,0,its ok,Little bigger than I expected. Need to get used to it. I think it will do the trick eventually. Looks cool.
10710,0,"Good performance, but TOO big....","I really like the waterproof function and that the buttons are easy to manage. It is also really quiet. What i don't like is it is too big around.....i know, i know...that is supposed to be a good thing, right? but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. The girth makes it difficult to insert and much less stimulating when using it to manually simulate intercourse. If it was 1/2"" - 1"" smaller around it would be great!"
10717,0,Nazi out general the British and French,You will see old grainy news reels but if you are interested how the Nazi defeated France and trapped the British at Dunkirk this will explain how it happened. The DVD that I purchased would freeze at times for 5 seconds to 30 seconds. What you will view is not of a good quality video. I would only purchase this DVD if you are a World War II history buff and at low price of under a buck.
10729,0,A good summer read for the beach or pool,"Didn't like this book as much as Kinsella's (aka Wickham) other books, but found it an entertaining book for beach-side or pool-side reading for sure. Reading this book was kind of like eating a whole box of chocolates--fun during the process, a guilty pleasure, but ultimately not completely satisfying. It was a little predictable, but fun.My favorite character was Maggie, a new mother who is utterly competent in the workplace, but finds herself at odds with being a first-time parent. I think the Maggie's struggles are something all new moms will sympathize with...I also thought the other three characters were entertaining. Buy it used, but don't pay full price for this one. Kinsella's other books would be more worthy of the price tag for a new book (i.e. Undomestic Godess, Shopaholic series)."
10733,0,A tad bit disappointing,"There is no doubt that ""Romeo and Juliet"" is a classic love and war tragedy that is one of the best ever. However, so many films and other stories have watered down the book, and once you see enough adaptations, you've had enough. This is a little out dated as far as dialogue is concerned, but this is a Shakespeare play I'm talking about. Too much time is taken betwwen the action scenes, but the ending is amazing. However, it's not enough to save this book from an average rating."
10739,0,Romeo & Juliet,"In my opinion, this book is not adaptable for kids because it shows the difficult and dramatic situation between Romeo and Juliet, and because there are a lot of battles were there is a lot of blood, that are not for kids.It tells that Romeo and Juliet cannot be together because their families were in a feud. Juliet's mother wants her to marry a man that is called Paris. In the other side Romeo had to kill a man called Tybalt, Juliet's cousin, because he wanted to kill Romeo. So Romeo had to escape to Mantua. Finally Juliet lies that she is dead so Romeo goes to see Juliet's body but before he had to kill Paris. After that he committed suicide and Juliet too.In conclusion I like it but it's obvious that children are going to read it."
10741,0,Respectable Overview of a Remarkable Career,"Legacy's Essential series has finally gotten around to releasing a collection on country queen Dolly Parton. The track listing features songs from Parton's early 1960's recordings all the way up to Dolly's 2001 Grammy winning reading of Collective Soul's song ""Shine"". The sound on this collection is at it's very best due to the remastering of all of the tracks.Hopefully some other jewels from Dolly's time with BMG, Legacy's parent company, will be reissued by the label in their original form. Parton has a very rich catalog of recorded music, most of which is long out of print and needs to be reissued for a whole new generation to discover and enjoy.If you are a new Dolly fan, then this is the collection for you. Long time fans are still longing for the early 1970's Dolly albums to be reissued and will probably already own the recordings featured on this CD."

10752,0,A little disappointed!!,"The story was well-written, but I was just a little disappointed with the ending. The book could have ended, so much more better than that.

10769,0,"One major flaw, so I can't give it five stars.","I love Oil filled radiator heaters, but I'm not so crazy about this one. Here's why - the electronic read out is nearly impossible to see, so all the wonderful features are wasted. You have to crouch down on your knees, and there has to be ample light.I advise you to save your cash, and buy the cheapest version of this item, with the manual on/off dial. The digital version will just make you feel like you are losing your eyesight.So, five stars for the oil radiator, just don't buy this one."

10787,0,wish that they didn't have their own software,If you've already got a big music collection in Windows Media Player or MusicMatch you're in for a lot of pain as you transfer your library into Creative's proprietary software application on your PC. All of the information about Music Genre will be stripped out during this process (despite the fact that Windows Media Player was able to read it from my database originally created with MusicMatch).Battery life is only about 5 hours (bad) but you can carry extras and replace them quickly (good).It is relatively easy to change tracks or volume by feel thanks to some little bumps in the controls. A pretty thoughtful mechanical design.
10788,0,Ski Touring book,I am new to the region and wanted some basic starter info on possible cross country ski areas. This gave me a starting point. It definitely is more back-country based so if you are looking for grooming you probably have to link in with the tahoe/truckee crowd and network from there-but if you haven't tried back-country......making your own tracks with the right gear is what this book steers you to.
10800,0,beach mats,"These mats are really cute and roll up nicely. They have convenient handles for easy carrying and they are really easy to shake the sand out of. However, if you are buying these to go to Hawaii, it is probably not worth it. Found out the hard way that they sell these (mind you without the frills) on every corner for $2-3. These are worth it if you really like the design and the handles for easy carrying."

10811,0,decent player if you don't touch it.,"This player looks good, sounds good(when you get its eq settings right) and has expandable memory. Thats the good stuff. Its big color screen has a habit of locking up whenever you press a button. It will show album art of a previously played song,and the title shown may or may not be the correct one playing. It also likes to freeze up when you press a button rendering all further inputs inoperable till it unfreezes. It also likes to list all songs stored on the memory expansion card twice, and includes album art in with your pictures. I've downloaded every firmwire update and still have these problems. But, if you just leave it sit and play on shuffle mode it makes a fine jukebox."

10817,0,So So,"I own several Sioux air tools and consider them to be very good quality. This right angle grinder seems to be only average quality. It isn't as smooth as I would like it to be. Be sure to purchase a mini grease gun along with this tool if you don't already have one. The head of this grinder came almost empty of grease. It's still a good tool as long as you don't pay too much for it. Expresstools.com has the best price I've found. All my other Sioux air tools I'm very happy with. This one, I'm just ""ok"" with it."
10826,0,Heltewr Skelter,"I bet Vincent never thought people would one day have home computers and be able to read the police reports and see the blood evidence because once you do that, you quickly find the book is complete B.S. The crimes could have never taken place as described by Vince. Manson was railroaded and believe me when I tell you I'm no fan of Charlie's but it is true, he was railroaded. Manson is doing life in prison from a story that is a complete lie. Man, what a country we live in when a person can become a millionaire by using the vicious murders of 7 people and no one challenges him. You should be ashamed of yourself Bugliosi. Only in America."
10831,0,Take note...,"It should be noted that this book does not contain any information on the planes found in the video games (Crimson Skies (Jewel Case)andCrimson Skies). I bought it hoping to find schematics/profile views of those planes so that I could build an RC model. Unfortunately, this book is really only useful to fans of the miniatures game or those who are fans of the Crimson Skies universe in general. Still an interesting read, but I was disappointed."
10839,0,Sizes Make a Difference,"You will get three different sizes, which is a waste when only one size fits you. Otherwise it is a durable product. I've had others that disintegrate after a few weeks use, but this product lasts."
10842,0,Somewhat disappointed,"I'm giving these a 3 star rating because despite the three different sizes, I never felt as if they gave a good fit. They are soft, but still contributed to some fatigue after wearing for more than an hour. Additionally, I bought these ear gels to replace the factory ear bud on the Jawbone 2. I never got a good fit and seal, and the JB2 felt unstable while wearing the ear gels. Also, they distorted the angle for the JB2, which needs to have a contact point along to jawbone to work properly. I eventually went back to the factory ear bud, which is less comfortable, but more functional."
10861,0,I had hoped for more,"Patrick Stewart is an incredible actor. I love his character in Star Trek and after the Star Trek movie where he finishes a quote from Moby Dick -- in a quiet, but passionate speech that he alone would stand agains the Borg, I expected more of this movie.But Patrick never reaches that deep, intraspective level. He is almost there when he realizes that he has driven Mr. Starbuck to contemplate murdering him. The tension between Mr. Starbuck and Capt. Ahab should have been more powerful. It was almost there, but not quite. I might have been an editing problem. It could have been a director problem. Not sure how or why this movie fell short, but it did. Mr. Starbuck plays his part well -- emotive and personal. He brings alive the man who ""Can no longer follow his God and follow Capt. Ahab,"" but the tempo and rhytm of the movie just didn't keep the necessary tension."

That means ofcourse there is some great moments and some less than great. found it as a cassette when I was 13 years old on the ground broken apart, decided to fix it up with tape and whatever. Was getting into metal, and was very curious about hearing more. to me at that point it sounded very evil and maybe even satanic a little. It was a little scarry to listen to! since then I spread way out into Jazz, classical, fusion, brittish invasion, but these tunes we're some of the first metal I heard that wasn't hair metal, and it is still pretty cool! I didn't even know that was Flotsom And Jetsom! Guess they were always good.Peter"
10904,0,Too Close to the Subject?,"In 1993-94, Ruhlman returned to his alma mater, University School in Cleveland, to explore the workings of an all-boys school and study its headmaster, the famously idiosyncratic Rick Hawley. In this context, I'd be hard-pressed to outline all my issues with Ruhlman's project, but his ""fly on the wall"" presentation of teachers and classes is consistently evocative--real, familiar, and true to the private school life I experience as a private school teacher. However, Ruhlman stumbles as he explains. When he tries to make something of his observations--to comment on what's distinctive about boys schools or what Rick Hawley represents or what anything adds-up to--he teeters on rationalization. If, as he says in the book, Ruhlman wanted his readers to ""fulfill"" the ""dramas"" he presented, he should have let them. Better yet, he might have left this task to someone who was not an alum of the school."

10918,0,Not bad...,"the game itself was a very enjoyable experience, just the fact that by the time I was done playing the game, I had blisters the size of pancakes on my thumb. The reason for this is because the game's character movement is done with the D-pad rather than the analog sticks, and since the combos are mostly divised of sliding your thumb all over the pad, it WILL hurt after awhile. but overall, a good game."

We were instructed to send back to the manufacturer, who issued a replacement. This one does work and my son is pleased. Not really sure how much he will play with it though. One thing that you are not made aware of, is that you should not play with it for more than 3 hours at a time, because the toy cannot be used more frequently than that. It does not work continously for 3 hours either, very hit or miss."
10932,0,Nothing new if you know anything already...,"After all the hype about this book and the foreword and endorsement from Massad Ayoob, I really thought this book would teach me something new. It didn't. I expected a nice primer on tactics and exercises, instead I got a bunch of rudimentary safety lecturing and rehash of obvious and well-known ideas and rules for handling a firearm. If you have NEVER owned a firearm before, this book may teach you something. If you do own a firearm and have any proficiency with it - that is, you take it out of the drawer from time to time to practice at the range - then don't waste your money on this very basic and boring book. This book has nothing to do with helping you move towards the decision to go CCW or really even how to defend your own home, except for one short chapter - and all of it is all common sense stuff anyway. An average book with nothing new."
10938,0,good book,i think that this book was a good book because it told alot of detail about the story and about the characters and the way they felt about what was going on. the author told you everything that you needed to know and even the things that weren't that important.
10941,0,Great music... but the sound engineer should be fired!,"With such an excellent assembly of artists and such a great selection of music, this extremely poor quality audio recording wasted what was a tremendous opportunity for an outstanding concert video. Specifically, certain vocal tracks and mike feeds were not captured at all or with very little presence. Two examples are not hearing Sting's classic ""I want my MTV"" during Knopfler's ""Money for Nothing"" and not hearing Paul McCartney in a later verse in ""Hey Jude"". The music was great but these disappointments significantly flaw the DVD."

10950,0,Courageous memoir!,"I applaud the author's courage in wanting to tell the story of her murdered cousins & her brother & the way the horrible tragedy of the murders impacted her family. The story is well-told & plainly written, but the author's decision to write in third person (even when writing about herself) is clumsy & tends to distance the reader in ways that feel counterproductive. A much better read in this vein is Strange Piece of Paradise by Terri Jentz which blew me away with both the author's courage & her skill as a writer."

In my opinion, if it wasn't for Michael, there wouldn't be no Janet. Somebody earlier stated that Michael fails to keep in contact with the audience. I don't agree. Michael keeps in contact with the audience from the beginning of his concerts to the end. When will you people see that Janet just copies her brother's dance. The show was great, but her concerts really are not as exciting as Michael's are. If you people have seen the HIStory tour it will blow you away. What I mean is that he had some killer special effects, and the lighting is tight! So my message is this, give credit where credit is due."

The information is good, though it can be a little one-sided in that the instructor makes it seem like the same things happen to every woman even though that isn't true. My husband learned a lot from the basic information segments, though if you have read pregnancy, labor and childcare books you probably won't. I was disappointed that they didn't show an actual birth because I wanted my husband to see it, but overall if you are looking for a childbirth class you can do at home, this one isn't bad."

The typeface and spacing of the novel in the kindle edition made the book difficult to read.

If I would have purchased a different version I would give this book at least 4 stars."
11033,0,Basic Stoner Rock,"If you like the fun genre known as ""stoner rock,"" then you'll like Sixty Watt. They revel in Sabbath riffs, mixed with liberal doses of southern rock. In this case, that's not all bad. ""Fear of Death By Water"" has some cool slide licks and singer Dan Kerzwick's rasp sounds like he just drank a 5th of whiskey. ""Low Earth Orbit"" has a laid back groove and existential lyrics, while ""Roll The Stone"" is pure Skynyrd all the way. As with a lot of bands that play this kind of music, their repetoire is limited and after awhile the songs tend to repeat themselves. This record is a good beginning though."

Parts of this film are a bit dragged out and I wish this movie was cut down to two hours but Flyboys will impress you frame by frame, enjoy!"
11050,0,Graphics are great,As a WWI aviation historian I was delighted to see a 21st century movie about aviation of this era. The acting and dialog was laughable to the point I turned the sound off. Although the accuracy of the few WW1 types of aircraft was spectacular the amount of them was far off the course of reality. This film would be excellent for using as back round flavor for a veteran pilot reunion.
11051,0,In the middle,"This seems to be one of those love or hate it pictures. I will start with the good. The historical accuracy is very good. The air battles are excellent. It is nice to finally have a movie covering WWI a little. The bad is the bland lead actor, the terrible cliches(white guy doesn't like black guy until the life saving event, then changes his heart. The lead who learns to work with others, etc.) Seen those in a million pictures. So overall, it is a well shot movie with a story worth seeing, but a lack of strong acting and compelling script bring this one down."
11053,0,"Entertaining, but disappointing for aviation buffs","Entertaining enough film but the CGI flying scenes never lose that computer game look. WW1 planes only flew at a maximum speed of about 115 mph yet in this film they flit about like something from Star Wars. If you want a reality check on what movie makers could deliver for a WW1 aviation movie - 30 years ago - just compare this film with "" The Blue Max"" or "" Aces High""."
11055,0,"Faded = SWEET, the rest are just OK","I bought soulDecision's cd because I absolutely loved the single ""Faded."" The beat of that song makes me DANCE and I don't equate it to other boy bands' songs. Frankly, the rest of the cd disappointed me a bit, but I didn't expect too much when I bought it. I am impressed with the fact that the guys all play their own instruments, but I must admit that the album far from blew me off my feet. I hope that soulDecision produces more singles as quality as ""Faded"" - the lead singer Trevor is a hottttie too, I saw them in concert in Seattle. Nice."
11060,0,a good film...,"that was ruined by its sound track. It's sad really, I almost would have really liked it. I may have been inclined to give it five stars if the sound track hadn't totally destroyed it."
11063,0,Ending lacked,"The movie was decent, good plot, good characters. The action lacked it was short. The ending also sucked."
11064,0,"3 Stars, is about right.","Im glad that the average rating for this movie is 3 Stars, because i think that is what it deserves. I Bought this with high hopes, but i was let down. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but i had a MAJOR problem with it. It would have been a 5 Star, if it wasn't for the Lighting. The last 30 - 45 minutes, was completely black. Almost, All that they had to do, was add some extra light. But besides that, it was a really good film.I wish that they would have corrected the lighting, so it could have been 5 star. I have seen NO BUDGET movies with better lighting than this. Acting was Great, LOTS of Blood && Gore, And the Characters were very likable."
11072,0,"if I had one wish, i'd never let him come back","In 2000, ""wait a minute"" feat. Lil' Kim was GOOD. I loved that song. Now, He comes back with this crap album. number one, he has too many people featured on his cd. Two, his voice is cracked.""one Wish"" was terrible. I had to leave the room. His voice is very whiny and I felt bad for him. If he went one octave lower, the song would sound much betterHe's now on ""one on one"" which is ok but his acting is not any better.RayJ was better 5 years ago. Now, he just happened to pop back up."
11074,0,batcycle sort of ok,I don't like how they have batman attached to the batcycle. You can't take him off! But he is good otherwise. He is good and bad. I am a 7 year old boy. I like pie!
11078,0,"Good, but not great","Not quite as good as her first two albums, but still quite nice. I will be interested to see if there is a remix version of this album as there were for Tanto Tempo and Bebel Gilberto."
11086,0,Not the best Fairbanks,"This is the third Fairbanks movie I've seen and quite frankly this is not really that good. It pales when compared to Robin Hood and especially Thief of Bagdad. The movie is too fragmented and needs way too many textboards to keep viewers up to par with the story.Fairbanks is fun to watch and when he's on screen he dominates. However,'presence' is not the same as acting. Fairbanks, and therefore the movie, is way too dependent on farcical comedy. At times the movie even edges dangerously close to a vaudeville act. Also his 'swashbuckling' in this movie amounts to not much more than just wildly wacking away with his sword. Maybe I saw it too soon after the hugely superior Thief of Bagdad...."
11093,0,Charecters Growing Old,"Starting too tire of the crews attitude and arrogance. They are cops for Pete's sake, not the end all of morality and all that is good. The episodes are starting to blend together and all have a familiar undertone of we are better then you feeling. These folks need a good dose of humble pie."
11097,0,A must-have for the FRM exam,"Jorion's book is indispensable (and, in my experience, sufficient) when preparing for the FRM exam; if you are taking it, think no more. An added bonus is the impressive number of typos and errors to test your knowledge :)"
11098,0,"Good Start, but fix the errors!!!","The errors in the sample test questions (and answers) need to be fixed! And since the sample test question came from GARP, then GARP should get on the stick and appoint someone in their org to fix 'em.If the errors had not been present, I'd have given it 5 stars. Book does a good job at taking the reader from start to finish across many different aspects of risk management, and in a very organized way. Not at an extremely quantitative level of depth, but enough so that you know about the big picture (risk-wise) regarding bonds, equities, commodities, credit risk, market risk, ops risk, regs, etc. I encourage all middle office trade analysis personnel to read this book from cover to cover, and to go for the GARP cert.I will use it as a reference, I'm sure."
11101,0,MINI WIERLESS CAMERA,"This camera is good but it looses signal very fast, so sound which is fine for a plane. Its more of a security camera than it is a ""model airplane"" camera. You get what you pay for with cameras. I think this is cheep but its up to you."
11103,0,Not as pictured....,"I bought this book because of the great story and the front cover. The story is fine, apart from the 70 odd page preface, but the front cover is nothing like the that pictured. Most disappointing as this was a 21st birthday present for my brother born in 1984. Not happy."
11107,0,George 1984,"Only thing I disliked about the book was the fact that I had to tape the cover, as it was falling apart."
11112,0,not Orwell's best,"""My recent novel is NOT intended as an attack on Socialism or the British Labour Party (of which I am a supporter) but as a show-up of the perversions to which a centralised economy is liable and which have already been partly realised in Communism and Fascism. I do not believe that the kind of society I describe necessarily _will_ arrive, but I believe (allowing of course for the fact that the book is a satire) that something resembling it _could_ arrive."" (G.O., letter to Francis A. Henson, 16 June 1949)This is not Orwell's best book. I've read it three times, and never failed to be underwhelmed. Try _Down and Out in Paris and London_, _Homage to Catalonia_ or _A Collection of Essays_ for insightful writing, and stay away from the satires (the other being _Animal Farm_)."
11119,0,prompt delivery,"This is the first time I have ordered a book online and was a little hesitant due to time restraints. My daughter needed George Orwell's 1984 for school and being unable to find it in a local bookstore, we tried ordering it off the internet. Supposedly delivery was delayed and we began to wonder if it would get here within 10 days for her deadline. The book arrived in 3 days in new condition and saved the day!"
11121,0,Middling,"Excellent insight into (and predictions about) abuse of technology by people in power--applicable to present-day governments--but the human-interest story (scare tactic) is lost in the stilted prose and the overuse of impersonal, third-person, dogmatic passages, running on for paragraphs."
11123,0,1984-George Orwell,"Although the book (1984 by George Orwell) arrived in good condition as described, the book cover was not as pictured. This book has an updated cover which was shown on the website; the book we thought we were purchasing. Although the text reads the same, the print type is smaller therefore the page numbers are different between the two books. We purchased this book for classroom use thus making it difficult to follow when the instructor refers to certain passages because the page numbers are not the same."
11134,0,"Great book, Great Price, but not so great formatting","I loved this book, but to be honest, I didn't read it in this form because the text was tiny and it was thick and unapproachable. I would get a different publication of this book, because it is a great read, but I don't like this one. I listened to this one as an audiobook, and it was AMAZING--get the one read by Frank Mullins if you like audiobooks, it was fantastic. Loved it, and recommend that version over this one."
11135,0,1984,"Winston is a party member in a government that controls the very thoughts of its citizens. He works diligently until he falls in love with Julia. He ignors his duties and disobeys his society. They find freedom for a while, but will it last? The society in the book is interesting and depressing, too. The characters have believable personalities. If you like happy books don't read it though. It's depressing and politcal but well written."
11138,0,"A book I admire, but don't particularly like","1984 is the kind of book that I admire more than like. I admire Orwell for how detailed and believable the world he builds is. For his efforts to set a dark and unsettling mood and for his detailed analysis of its politics.The reasons I don't like it as much as so many other people? Well, it didn't do anything for me. I couldn't relate or feel anything for the characters. I didn't find the story haunting or particularly appealing. It didn't even make me think, when I was reading books like Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 or Camus' The Fall I had to close every few pages to think about it, because I couldn't hold my thoughts back, with 1984 this didn't happen at all.Reading it's a subjective experience, no matter how good a book is, if you don't feel anything as a result of reading it, why then give it a high rating?I wish I'd liked it better, or at least spotted any major reason for my dislike, but I didn't."
11146,0,1894 review,"Was a good book, but could have PLENTY of more features like an appendix or quotes and synopsis added. Otherwise, a good book, 1894 is a masterpiece from Orwell."
11147,0,1984... kind of depressing,"I bought this book about 3 weeks ago and I'm still ""trying"" to read it. It's depressing and the theme is kind of old, so I'm not that enthusiast with it. I was born abroad and this was not a required reading material while I was in school. I'm just very happy that I've never lived in a place like that. Hope it gets better towards the end."
11152,0,Dog Tutu,"Very cute, but sized for small dogs; the XL size was too small for my 80 lb. Golden, and I returned it to the vendor"
11158,0,Cali is Active is a good album,"Cali is Active ***1/2 StarsThis is a very good album by the dogg pound and a very decent one for the west coast who has recovered nicely, there is some flaws on this one, but the rest is just good old fashion west coast cali magic in this thing.Thumbs Up."
11175,0,Overrated,"It's not a bad book. But Fahrenheit 451 is hardly representative of the best that the Sci-fi genre has to offer, and it's a shame that it's endless place on students ""summer reading lists"" hasn't been challenged. For some reason fahrenheit 451, the Martian Chronicles and 1984 seem to have been decided on as the representatives of science fiction according to your average english teacher... and that's doing the students a disservice. So, read and enjoy this book, but if you find it a bit dry and it's your first forray into SF, by all means keep exploring. There are SO many better books out there..."
11178,0,"Very interesting, good plot, but a bit gloomily written","The story-line and plot of the book were excellent, and Bradbury did an excellent job at setting the scence, however, hsi writing left me somewhat confused and uninterested at times. The ending wasn't too great either...I really liked 1984 much better."
11179,0,Disappointing,"Story of Guy Montag, a ""fireman"" in a repressive society, who repents his job of burning books and joins an underground society committed to memorizing the great works of literature. Bradbury's excessively florid, overwrought prose bothered me greatly. The futuristic society of book-burners never really seemed fully realized or plausible. Dealt with some questions of book burning and censorship intelligently, but still seemed a bit nave. Bradbury struggles with long-form fiction. Never felt the execution rose to the level of thematic ambition."
11188,0,Your typical required reading material...,"Basically, Montag, a firefighter from the ""future"", burns down houses that have books inside. In the ""future"", books are banned, and Bradbury tries to describe a world of the ""future"" with big screen, color TVs. Too bad, Bradbury, that this world is already here.It was mostly a boring read, except for a few moments. You could describe this book as depressing. Everyone, even Montag, seems to be unhappy, and I really don't care what Bradbury has to think about how depressing our world is becoming."
11195,0,Frightening Realism,"This book was neither good, nor was it bad. I admit, it was a difficult read...it was very slow paced...but the story had a frightening realism to it. It depicts a society where books are burned and knowledge is, in essence, controlled by a government out of control. The premise was very interesting, but the paistagging detail in which everything was described left me fairly bored with it. It has a nice moral...if you can stick out the bordom."
11196,0,It is worth reading it,"This books is interesting. It's about a man named Montag who is a fireman but instead of putting out the fire, he starts them by burning the books he finds in other people's houses. In my own opinion I think this book is about reality, because even though we are no burning books a lot of people are losing interest in reading them. Peolpe would rather watch T.V.,play Nintendo,get on the computer and do everything from there than going through a book. So you will probably like to read this book.You will understand the importance of books and you will appreciate them more."
11198,0,Fahrenhiet 451,"Fahrenheit 451, a science fiction book written by Ray Bradbury, is a good read. In the book, Guy Montag, a fireman, is paid to burn books. In fact, all fireman are paid to burn books. This book, being a science fiction, takes place in the future. Guy enjoys his job. He gets paid well and understands the system, books are for burning. He is under the impression that books are full of nothing but garbage. He meets a girl named Clarisse who changes his views completely. He starts to become more interested in books. He hides books in his house. He suddenly realizes what he has been doing. This book is a somewhat difficult read. It may not be enjoyed by children under sixth grade. The sentences are somewhat long and complex. At times, the vocabulary is also difficult. I would rate this book fair. I would only recommend it to people who are heavily interested in science fiction."
11199,0,Very Interesting,Fahrenheit 451 was very realistic and makes you wonder if the world will turn out like that. Ray Bradbury is also a great author. His description is very good. Fahrenheit 451 is almost a little to advanced. It is hard to imagine the world ever getting that way. I personally prefer books that could actually happen and this seems very unreal.But does keep you wondering what will happen. Many youth seemed to like this book and I think it was very interesting.
11210,0,A review of the AUDIO BOOK,"This is just a short review of the audio book of this great classic read by the author. The rendition is just terrible. It may be interesting to listen to the author's voice, but he is clearly no professional reader (and of course he should not expected to be!!), his voice is hoarse, and the rendition overall very very unpleasant to listen to, to the point that I ended up stopping listening to the CDs after a short while. I love audio books, but this one cannot be recommended at all, unless you have a special interest in getting acquainted with Bradbury's voice. If you want to listen to a good author who's also an accomplished reader of his own stories, try Neil Gaiman!"
11217,0,Fahrenheit 451,It is a great book but you have to really understand what going on in the story others why you can get lose during reading it!!
11219,0,Okay- but not the best futuristic book.,"So, I ordered this book after consistent protesting from my fiance that this was fantastic. Maybe it was a combination of how high he had built it up, or the fact that I was never forced to read this when I was in school, but it did not impress me. It was an OKAY book, I am just was not overly impressed. Plus, I feel kinda cheated that I had to pay so much for it, compared to other Kindle books. Overall, I would recommend it if you are very interested in futuristic works, but otherwise, it is not the best read."
11228,0,"In the words of Homer Simpson ""Good, but not Great""","When I was handed my copy of this book I thought that it was going to be up there with ""1984"" and ""A clockwork Orange"" ""Lord of the flies"", that sort of thing. But I was mistaken. The book was kind of shallow at times and left me thinking ""there should be more to this"" but there was not. The whole book I was waiting for something big to happen, but nothing ever did. The book did however have some good points. Bradbury has an odd writing style that I'm not a big fan of. That is why, it got 3 stars from me."
11229,0,One of the Classics,I really enjoyed this book. One of those amazing stories that you see reflected in so many other stories today. My only complaint is that the writing style to me felt like I was reading one long runon sentence. Amazing read none the less. :)
11231,0,Not Free SF Reader,"Watch tv, sheeple.In the future, books are banned, and drugs and the good old electronic screen are used to keep the population docile and uninformed. Firemen don't put out fires here, they burn books when they are found, in a big macho showy way. One such bloke begins to have doubts about his occupation and society, and breaks away."
11238,0,"Great Potential, But...","I eagerly anticipated watching this movie, and for most of its duration, it lived up to its billing.It jolts you from the start when a lonely caregiver stumbles upon the gruesome corpse of a young woman. The movie has segments which describe other women who are, in some way, linked to the victim. These segments are well-acted, poignant, but brief perspectives of each woman's life, and for a moment this looks like it might become one of the truly great movies of recent years. And then the end sort of leaves you hanging, and wondering. It feels as if the characters are seeking closure, and yet closure is not something you think of when the movie is over.This is the movie's only real flaw, though. It is beautifully scripted, written, and acted. Ah, if only..."

11245,0,Dear Mad'm,"This is a fun read, written about a region with which I'm familiar. The fact that an elderly author penned this tome adds to its merit. I'm sure she, as well as her family, took pride both in the accomplishments she describes and in her publication of a book about them. Dear Mad'm makes great light reading."
11254,0,"Great theatre, no captions","Live in a household with hearing impared person, and need the close captioning for her enjoyment. this film doesn't have it. But I love anything with Colin Firth,, so will keep"
11257,0,Disappointed with the choices on these DVD's,"I am a fan of Colin Firth and Hugh Grant and Judi Dench, but the choices on these two disks are only so so. There are only two of the eight movies included which I consider worth watching. Really disappointed."
11271,0,Dry but full of truth.,"It's pretty hard to get through some of this book. I had to read it for a program that I'm doing through my church. There's a lot of good information, especially in the fasting chapter; but overall it tends to be a little repetitive and there aren't enough practical suggestions for how to actually start doing the things he suggests we should do, at least not for my liking. Overall, it was a fair book - you probably won't enjoy it much but you'll benefit from what it says, if you put it into practice."
11273,0,i ve known hatebreed since they started,Many people have not heard HATEBREEDS older recordings.There new record kind of lacks some of the anger and ferocity of older recordings.It was a little disappointing to hear their first big release.If you like their albim on victory then you must hear their old stuff. Not a bad cd but does not compare to older recordings like the hatebreed/integrity split 7in.
11288,0,Little let down by this show,"I love the entire stargate series but this one was a bit of a letdown overall. Ohh well, at least I have it to complete my collection on the shelf. Wife loves that :P"
11295,0,Not the best,"It was an interesting spin on an alternate time-line; however, it isn't a movie that I would watch over and over again. I must say I was a little disappointed. The upside of the movie is there is closure on one of the longer running story lines."
11298,0,"Blu-Ray ""Quality"" Sucks.","Save your money, they cheaped out big time on the blu-ray version. The picture quality is horrible. Shame on them for ripping off fans like this!!!! We pay $**.**, and then an extra $10 bucks on top of that to get the blu-ray high quality, and what they deliver is a pixelated grainy so-called ""movie"" that's no better than a double-episode of the TV series, at a price approaching that of an entire season on DVD."
11299,0,Stargate - Continuum,OK film. First time viewed. Don't need to see it again. More my wife's thing...
11302,0,"Basic rice cooker, doesn't do brown rice without prep work.","This is just a basic rice cooker that has a vegetable steamer insert. It does not have a brown rice setting. If you want to make brown rice, you have to soak it overnight. Not ideal for a busy lifestyle. Also, the water level measurement lines on the inner bowl are very hard to see since they are the same gray-black color as the rest of the bowl."
11318,0,an unordinary movie with a pumping soundtrack,"""Lola rennt"" is the original title. And in Germany the movie was the hit of the year. But the film has some unreal scenes, for example when lola runs around a corner, she returnes in a street which is 7 km from that corner. But I like that movie because of some great scenes and the brilliant soundtrack that makes lola run even faster."
11327,0,Just confirming the review already here.,"Indeed, the tea is okay, the box is a joke. The full price is outrageous for this low quality clumsily decorated cardboard. Consider buying only for the price of tea, say for $15."
11335,0,This Fit was Odd,"I ordered 2 Le Mystere Bra's I am a 32 DDD. One fit well but this one seemed very small I was hanging out top and sides. I had to return this one, I would order 1-2 sizes up."
11336,0,Fun and surprinley challenging for a kids game.,This game was really fun and it wasn't too easy like the other Rugrat's games i have played. The only thing that irritates the hell out of me is collecting the hidden funny money to unlock the special mini games. There's an area in the game where there is tons of funny money but its impossible to get to. But overall it's a fun game and especially if you a Rugrat's fan.
11346,0,NOT UP TO THE ORIGINAL,"One of the best actors in contemporary films is Lili Taylor. She was the only element of this film to make it worth viewing. Everyone was likeable, but the screeplay's potential, about the house's secret, never climbed to the level of suspense. The ghostly manifestations scream ""computer"" and this works against any creation of an eerie atmosphere. The one excellent eerie moment is Lili Taylor looking at her reflection in the mirror. One thing that amazed me, apart from the screenplay, was how attracted I was to Lili Taylor whom I never previously regarded in that way. Catharine Zita Jones played the sexy character, but, for my money, Lili Taylor was far more appealing in both personality and physical look."
11350,0,The Haunting is so scary!!! just kidding!,"This movie was o.k. The first time I saw it at the movie theater,It was scary. I couldn't believe a pg-13 movie could actually be scary. But this movie had me going from the beginning to the end. it had cool special effects.(my favorite part) And Owen Wilson was my favorite character. He made it funny. Overall, I say this movie was good but the script and plot could have been a little better."
11351,0,If You've Read the Book This is an Adaptation of...,"This movie is (somewhat) based on the Shirley Jackson horror story The Haunting of Hill House. If you've read and loved that novel, you need to skip watching this movie. Jackson was able to scare readers with very few words. She didn't rely on tricks.I loved that book. This movie is an OK spooky film, but it doesn't come close to Jackson's work."
11352,0,EH,"Laughable special effects, but Lili Taylor is super-great and who can down a film where CZJ plays a hot bisexual? Something fun to watch while drinking cheap liquor and eating Cheetos."
11368,0,Not the best diaper bag,"My first diaper bag was the Pooh bag by ""Dolly"". It looks cute, but the exterior is difficult to clean. Also the interior vinyl/pvc lining can tear after light useage.In sum, this bag was not so great. If you want a very simple bag, and do not have high expections, then this bag will fill that need. This bag is okay and somewhat durable if you don't mind interior tears.When my second baby was born, I prefered using the free diaper bag I got at the hospital, rather than the ""Dolly"" Pooh bag. The free hospital bag had more features/ pockets by far than this simple sack."
11369,0,Good so far,I would recommend anyone wanting to brush on studying for the ASVAB for this book. Got here in time. Lent it to a friend and they didnt complain.
11376,0,A nice change of pace,"Modern American readers will probably find a lot of distance between themselves and Gogol, who writes with an observational comedy about the world he sees around him. But since the themes are timeless, his work will be pleasing, and often very funny, to most discerning readers."
11379,0,Subpar,"The knurls were not large enough to create a tight fit with the inner hinge. I'm worried that the hinge will rotate on the pins instead of the pins rotating in the bushing, causing hinge wear and thus trashed hinges. A Possible remedy that I didn't think of during installation would be to beat around the inner hinge holes to shrink them down, facilitating a tight fit."
11383,0,A bit slow with Nikon coolpix 4300,"Just as some other comments described, the card is slow when used with Nikon camera. When you take a shot, it takes three seconds to complete. It is still within a workable range to me. Nikon's manual does not list SimpleTech as a definite compatible candidate. However, with the price, I think the performance is OK. For people that consider speed an important factor, maybe this card is not a right choice to work with Nikons."
11386,0,poor intonation,"Lovely, captivating and involving music, but the brass & winds play consistently out of tune. Some will never notice this, but for me it is like nails on a chalkboard. I wonder if the orchestra rehearsed the score at all prior to the recording. As much as I love the music, it is painful to listen to. These composers deserve better treatment than this. I'll give this copy away, and hope a different orchestra and conductor record this music. I will make the same comment on the album ""Guatemala"" (music of Ricardo Castillo only). Save your money."
11388,0,Classic but Seems a bit Lost in Translation,"This is a great book, but it just didn't hook me. Really the last 1/4 of the book was the best, so worth a bit of a slog through some earlier parts. Maybe it is the translation from Spanish to English, and maybe its that families don't play as key of a role in our identity in U.S. culture as in Latin American culture. It just didn't seem as lyrical and moving as I was expecting. Nonetheless GGM's writing style is unique and fascinating, and the book does provide a glimpse into another way of viewing the world."
11389,0,Moving in small doses,"From what I've heard, this book is far more powerful in the original Spanish, and I can only lament that I don't speak Spanish. I felt that long stretches of the book, such as Colonel Buendia's various revolutions and the chapters dealing with the banana plantation, were great. The elements of magical realism were as touching as they were astonishing. But I never grew unaccustomed to the book's pace, which moves herky-jerky through the decades, sometimes focusing on a single event for pages, then leaping several weeks in a single sentence. In the end, I felt like I hadn't gotten to know a single character. All the people in the book mystified me. Their fears, hopes, and regrets, were lost on me."
11391,0,"Good, but not great.","Honestly i cant really see why this book in particular is so great as to deserve a nobel prize, just this book at least. I havnt read any of the authors other works, which may be a little more deserving. Anyhow, the book is genuinely origional. The idea of a story that goes through a whole family's rise and fall was great, the repetiton of names, however much it was needed for the underlying ideology of the story, got to be a little too much for me to bear though, bordering on annoyance. The book itself never really drew me into it either, too many parts of it read like a history textbook, by the time the last few chapters rolled around I was just reading to finish it up, desperately hoping for something to save it, and the ending, however meaningful, was too little too late. The book did have its moments, dont get me wrong, but for me the cons too much outwieghed the pros."
11392,0,"Great work of literature, bad edition.","The book is great. However, this particular copy was not well bound and the pages were not well cut. I returned it and received another copy in a similar bad state. If you plan to read this book, buy another edition."
11394,0,You have to be fascinated by Gabriel,"to relate to his writing style, otherwise you'll find it dull and boring. Just as I did. I'm not that much of a fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's books, because most, if not all, of them are written in a sense that the writer is making up the story as you read along... A sense of disorientation. I don't like that in a book. I like a story line, somthing to expect to... suspense, drama... not a vague idea as to what the writer thinks of his hero's (or his own?) miserable life.It's written beautifully, that's for sure. But it's most certainly not enough. Being able to write attractive and intellectual phrases does not make a bad story better. Especially if there's no story at all. I didn't like."
11396,0,Groundbreaking and interesting in theory. Horrendous to actually read.,"I understand that this book was absolutely groundbreaking and created whole new literary techniques. But that's the only thing that made me slog through it. I kept expecting it to get better, but it didn't. I'm glad I was never assigned to read this in school.If I want magical realism, I'll stick to Isabelle Allende. Though my friends say Love in the Time of Cholera is amazing. I plan to give GGM a second chance."
11403,0,"Lyrical, but Tedious","It's fun to tell members of the overeducated elite that you didn't care for this novel. After puffing up a bit and expostulating upon Garcia Marquez's qualifications as an ""important"" writer, and upon the novel as a ""modern classic,"" most give in and admit that it wasn't a particularly good read for them, either."
11409,0,Omni Mount missing part,"Omni Mount product arrived missing the plate on the end of the mounting arm. This is a key part and installation cannot complete without this. I called Omni Mount and they did not have the individual part, but sent me another complete cantilever mount at no charge. Response was good, but I had to wait an extra week for the second shipment to arrive. Installation instructions, fit and finish of the cantilever mount are very good. I am also very satisfied with how it works and looks in the room where it is installed."
11424,0,People seriously liked this movie?,"I saw this movie in my high school English class. I was very surprised to see that it had come out on video. I remember wondering what happened next. Now that I know the name of the movie, I can get the sequel. Even though I'm curious to find out the rest of the story, I wouldn't rate this as the greatest movie of all time. Still, if you don't have anything better to do, watch it. It is interesting, and it has its comical, and sad moments."
11425,0,The Searchers Greatest Hits,"There are a handful of really great songs on this cd that are classic rock-n-roll gotta-have-a-copy hit songs. The rest, however, seemed to me to be no more than ""filler"" quality songs added to complete a full album back in its recording day--now the cd equivalent of an album. I can't believe that any of those lesser-known songs could really rate as being among the Searchers' greatest hits."
11430,0,"Brainless, but not without brawn","If you're looking for a film that's smart AND sexy, this isn't it. However, if you just want to relax and fill your mind with a couple of hours of loud music, a gooey romance, and a ""dreams finally fulfilled"" kind of story, this is the right movie. The women dance hard, the boy is cute (and one of the founders of the group Tap Dogs), and the songs Violet writes are a little too sappy to be pop. Playing the 'new girl' Piper Perabo turns in a believable performance as the wide-eyed hopeful in the big bad city. However, it was always a little too convenient that everytime she or those around her get in hot water, she always saves the day. The supporting cast of women are indeed bad girls punching guys and mouthing off whenever possible. The features on the DVD are actaully pretty inventive. So by all means buy the movie if you're gonna need something thoughtless to get through an all nighter or a slow Friday night. In short, it's just brainless fun."
11440,0,Two Good Songs,"The soundtrack for ""Kate & Leopold"" includes the wonderful ""Still"" by Sting, but the rest of the soundtrack is instrumental. While stirring and reminiscent of the movie, calling up the images and dialog in one's memory, it's not something to listen to over and over. If you can find it, and don't want the incidental soundtrack, just buy the one song."

11451,0,It got me hooked,"The first book I read by Piers Anthony; it got me hooked immediately. Though not his best book (check out the first few books in the ""Xanth"" series or his entire ""Incarnations of Immoratality"" series), it is very well written with an engaging story line.

11460,0,It's Missing Something Amazon Says It Has...,"NOTE: Don't click no if you already have this CD.Part One has the enhanced video, NOT the part two with remixes. This CD has some fairly bad remixes on it. The second track, the K&M; remix, is more than 6 minutes, and it drags on. It's decent with the words it has. The second is over 10 minutes, the Plastika remix, is just horrible. It has only the chorus and the la la la's. For over ten dollars, you should get part one with two bonus tracks, the album version of CGYOOMH and the enhanced video, which is just awesome.BOTTOM LINE: She needs some new remixers."
11464,0,It was ok,"Throughout the story you can see the talent of Langston Hughes. However, the subject was not unique or original for the current times. Granted, it may have been something special whe it was first written and published. We have all seen movies or read stories with the exact same plot; it's not worth reading if you're looking for a new story.If you want to experience the beauty of Hughes' writing then you should give this novel a chance. It's a short read at 300 pages, but the poet's talent shines through in numerous passages.This was my first exposure to the author and I will probably read more of his work along the way. Hopefully, there will be more unique story lines as I continue through his art."

11467,0,Much smaller than I expected. Wouldn't have paid what I did,"I was a bit disappointed with this toy and so was my 5 yr old. When I recieved it I opened the package expecting to find something worth the near $20 I spent. Christmas day, my son lost interest in it about 10 minutes after opening it. It's been a table decoration in his room ever since. Perhaps this toy is better suited for a 2 or 3 yr old and the cost should be closer to $10 instead of $20."
11472,0,Cute but not as high quality as kids need,I bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas and when we opened it the top jaw was disconnected. My husband was able to reconnect it but now we feel like it has to be more protected than most toys and wonder how long before it breaks. It is small and cute and quite a bit of fun although the fun is very short lived.
11475,0,thought it was a full size :(,"I paid 30 dollars for this product, there was no notification that it was a SMALL or TRAVEL sized crocodile dentist. So when i received it, i was pretty disappointed. It doesnt have the full effect of the original crocodile dentist :("
11476,0,Fun that gets a little old pretty quick.,"This toy was a lot of fun... for the first day or so. It's a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be. But, it does exactly what it is supposed to. It doesn't hurt when it snaps shut, just startles a little. The problem is, how many times can you really push the buttons until it snaps and still have fun? It is pretty useful for making decisions. Who ever makes the crock snap has to clean the playroom!!"
11478,0,This is a TRAVEL SIZE version,"I was under the impression that this was the full size version since nowhere in the ad did it state it was travel size. With that being said, t is still much fun for my 2 and a half year old. She loves the surprise chomp."
11482,0,Slow Moving but Sagacios,"Political Scientist James Q. Wilson is undeniable a brilliant cultural commentator. Unfortunately, most of the essays in this collection move at a snail's pace and failed to fully engage me. I would have found it more beneficial if he had employed more anecdotal vignettes rather than utilize a broad, abstract approach in addressing social problems.Most of this collection was previously released in other publications or delivered as speeches, and from what I have read of his work in the past, this selection is far from the cream of his crop.Still the crepuscular presentation does not fully obliterate the smart insights conveyed among the included passages. At times it may require that readers dig deeply to hit pay dirt, but there are some scintillating nuggets buried within these pages."

I was half-way expecting the knife and axe to be super flimsy plastic like the dollar store stuff, but it's actually pretty sturdy. I gave this product 3 stars because the binoculars are very blurry and almost impossible to look out of and the flashlight is very cheap, barely works. But everything else is neat and my 4-year-old seems to love it (especially the compass watch & axe)."
11499,0,A strange gay suicide,"It appear to be a movie about the last days of an historical English gay Hollywood film director.The acting is good, but the theme is just not what I like in a movie.He makes passes at a college student and his ex-marine gardener.Lynn Redgrave is very good as the maid/ cook character actor.The English seem, like the Catholic Priesthood, have a real problemwith homosexuality."
11501,0,"Entertaining read, ended too quickly...","This book started out really well, and kept my attention throughout, however- Ms. Glass seems to have rushed the ending. The story develops the characters well, and is believable and entertaining. I just thought the climax was rushed. Everything happens in the last chapter, and it just seemed like she wanted to finish the book without finishing the story. I would recommend this book for an easy read."

With a publishing date of 1992, keep in mind that a great deal of legislation has happened concerning abortion in the past 12 years which is not reflected in this book. Still, it is a useful tool for someone looking to talk about 1. abortion issues, 2. the way our legislators' votes can directly affect our lives, and 3. one's religious beliefs or lack thereof. I'll keep it on my homeschool bookshelf for a reference book."
11514,0,"Time to look up ""Modern""","In reference to LadyNaava's complaint that this volume doesn't actually contain current or recent slang. I fear that's impossible. At least for a bound reference.

Given this arrangement, instructors can construct discussions either enhancing the material or taking a counter perspective."

11529,0,it started off really well...,"But the tenderness and fireworks that marked the pair in the beginning of the book, the sparks that made the couple so special seemed to fade as the necessity to wrap up the mystery moved to the forefront. Our hero and heroine were simply on a collision course of love, and I never believed that anything would keep them from it. Once the mystery was inevitably resolved, all that was left was for them to fall into each others arms.""If A Man Answers"" was obviously well researched, and I give Ms. Lovelace full points for setting the scene. There were some good moments, no doubt about it - but ultimately this book isn't going to be a keeper."
11532,0,"Great scholarship, cumbersone format, moderate contribution","The WBC Genesis commentary, vol. 1, by Wenham, follows the series' format, which has technical material first, then scholarly textual evaluation and criticism, finishing with the commentary. For all but the most diligent Hebrew scholars, the first section will be overkill. For those who hold a high view of scriptural inspiration, the documentary theories and sympathetic comments about late editing found int the middle section will frustrate and lessen credibility. The commentary is solidly done, and while not agreeing at every point, I find it generally very helpful and worth consulting."

11545,0,Strong smell,"I gave it three stars, as I really could not say if it works or not. For me it has such a strong smell, kind of minty , makes my face tingle slightly that I decided for the high price it was not worth it.I did hear a lot of great things about exuviance products and will try out some others, their toner I know is really good, I got to try a bit of it, it definitely removed all remaining make up after you wash your face, it has a bit of a orangy smell, but the smell goes away within less then a min. and it might just be the way how I preceive the smell."

But he makes many inaccurate statements about C and Perl, in my opinion, while making Java out to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. I'm keeping the book, at least for now, as a reference, but I'm learning Java from better books, viz, Eckel's Thinking in Java, and publisher Addison Wesley's The Java Tutorial."
11582,0,Not comprehensive nor essential,"This is not a particularly good collection of the 1970s punk-pop band's best work.

Instead, I figured out who the ""bad person"" was as soon as they were introduced. And there was nothing scary about the book at all. Sure, Holmes and Watson are very engaging characters and I enjoyed learning more about ""the bad person"" after all was said and done. But, I just didn't find anything that special about the story. Sorry!"
11591,0,diagrammed psychology,"Of course I agree with other reviewers that the content of the book is very interesting. I read it completely, despite the painfully boring flatness of the prose itself. It might be useful for a psychologist trying to understand a patient in an unpleasant love affair: ah yes, now you're at Stage 2, subdivision 3, section 1a. Imagine a mechanical drawing, say, an exploded diagram of a pencil sharpener.. why not call it a work of art? Glorious detail, exact descriptions, complete and entire... But it's not a work of art creatively. To say that Svevo is a bridge between George Eliot and James Joyce misses totally the art of the language itself created by those two."

First of all this is not even remotely a jazz cd, I count 8 of the 14 tracks that would be considered drum and bass/downtempo. ...My Soul will be purchased on the strength of of MY LOVE alone which is flat out the best urban track I've heard in 2003. Other highlights are the cuts Everyday People, December and the quirky Freak Out. Don't get me wrong, Candy can blow and Mindy Adair should contact her for some lessons, but most of Right in My Soul sounds like Kraftwerk attempted to make a jazz cd...."

Back in the 40s so many would have been made in colour had the producers forseen the future, VHS, laserdisc and DVD. The colour was very good even at EP speed, so imagine it on blu ray. I know some fans of the movie prefer the original B/W, so why not put it out on blu ray with two seperate discs as they did recently with ""It's A Wonderful Life"". Those blue uniforms with yellow stipes come out wonderful. The movie itself I would give 5 stars but because of this disapointing release it's only three."

You may groove a little in your chair listening to this cd, but it's nothing to get up and funk about."

11637,0,It's ok - not the best but not the worst either!,"The beginning is a little slow - and pointless - the middle is ok as far as scary goes. There is way too much cursing which sounds out-of-place. You don't believe it so it makes it seem fake. The ""show-down"" was a let down with a stupid ending. Then the ending itself was stupid too. I saw someone say it had the ""typical American happy ending"" - I don't understand that since no one leaves the movie happy! Again - the scary parts are semi scare worthy - but don't expect much of a resolution to the so-called story."

Once I passed the first few chapters the book became interesting. This book is Texas based, so I could identify with several of the places in the story and this made me want to continue reading it. In the end it turned out to be a cute story, similar to some of Eric Jerome Dickey's work. It was also similar to the book ""One woman short"". It's not a book that I would ever read again, so I would suggest that you check it out at a library and read it before you buy it. I'll probably be selling my copy on Amazon soon...."

It is appropriate that he did so, because his lyrics and sound are slightly less murderous. Fans of classic Ghostface Killah, such as myself, might find this album a little too mainstreamy for their taste. Songs like ""Tush"" w/ Missy Elliot, and ""Ghostface,"" are strictly clubbin' songs with bland lyrics. The Pretty Toney Album does have its gems, though. ""Be This Way,"" which Ghostface describes as ""real gangsta shxt,"" is the strongest, most classic song on the album. ""Metal Lungies"" w/ Styles P. and Sheek Louch is another standout track. Sheek Louch and Ghostface both rip rap a new one. Fans of Ghostface Killah buy all of his albums, and they should. Ghostface has one of the most ""pretty toney"" sounds in the rap game, but don't expect a ""Supreme Clientelle"""

Sadly, while this one does perform slightly better than the last warmer I tried - it does NOT keep coffee warm enough to suit me.I'm still using it - but I'm also still on the look out for a warmer that meets my needs."
11709,0,Doesn't fit oversized mugs,"This only fits a standard sized mug, wish it had a bigger surface. My over sized coffee cup sits on the rim of the warmer, still keeps my tea & coffee warm until I remove from heat or turn off. DON'T forget to turn off, not automatic."

I have to cover the mug unless I drink it quite rapidly."

Two of the early stories in particular, Marstube and Trouble In Time, are pure adolescent space opera, while the other early story, Best Friend, is not much more than a sketch. The later stories pack more of a punch, although the longest one, Critical Mass, promises more than it delivers. Only for completists who must have everything this duo wrote."

11750,0,Sound is mediocre; still a great movie,"I bought this for my wife, for Mother's Day, to replace our videotape version which was not in the widescreen, theater layout. It is of course great to have Moonstruck now on DVD, in the letterbox format, but the sound seems to have been mixed a little low. I'm tempted to say the sound may have been also a touch less clear than our videotape version. So, one has to crank up the volume on the TV, which isn't such a big deal, but the next time you turn on the TV: Blam! It's blaring."
11758,0,"Very okay, inexpensive diapers","I bought these diapers because of their low price. They are okay, and comparable to luvs. I was expecting better absorbancy since they are ""Pampers,"" but I didn't get it. If your child is close to going up in size, I'd say order a size up. They fit fine either way, but it gives you more absorbancy to avoid leaks. I'm satisfied becuase of their price, but they aren't my first choice in diapers."
11762,0,"Product was OK, ship time was NOT!","It took nearly three weeks for these to fianlly ship. I should have canceled, but I didn't realize until they showed that we had too many for that weight period left."
11764,0,its ok,I thought they were the swaddlers so i was a little disappointed. But they worked fine. I think you should use cloth because it is more cost effected and better for the environment. My babe was to small to fit in the cloth diapers that we had so we had to use disposables. So I am very happy to start using cloth now that he is gaining weight. But what whatever diaper you choose you are the best mom or dad for you baby. Keep up the good work and and love them lots.
11767,0,Diapers,I thought I was buying the Swaddlers when I ordered these diapers. They sometimes leak and are inferior to the Swaddlers. I loved the economy size though and would order that many again.
11769,0,Little dissatisfied,Product seems inferior in quality to the Baby Dry product we bought from a store. There is no wetness indicator either.Not very satisfied.
11772,0,As expected,"Pampers are the best, softer and better looking that the BJ brand which I used to buy just to save couple bucks until now, amazon got those for even better price and better quality, you can't beat this deal."
11783,0,Good diaper but it's scented!,The diaper does what it's supposed to do but I was disappointed by the overwhelming fragrance. It's really strong. And mixed with diaper contents make the diaper even more unpleasant smelling.
11792,0,Not as good as Dry Max !,"Accidently ordered this one instead of ""Dry Max"" ... the diapers are thinner, lighter and didn't hold as much as ""Dry Max"", but it's usable. Because it didn't cost much cheaper than ""Dry Max"" ... so this was the only non-Dry Max Pampers that I ordered since."
11795,0,not the FLEX as advertised,"i really liked the new FLEX version of the baby dry diapers. this is advertised as the FLEX but wasn't when i recieved it. dissappointing, b/c it's harder to use on my kids without that stretch tab."
11796,0,Pretty good for use,"Im not too happy with this product. I would personally have preferred Swaddlers or even Huggies. The problem with baby dry is the side leakage - there are high chances for it. There are no elastic type material on the sides that can make it cling on to the baby's back side. The other 2 products I mentioned above do. So if your baby poops (liquid poop) quite a bit, this may not be useful. For me, my baby started going once or twice a day, so this diaper works."
11799,0,So-so,"I like pampers diapers. These hold pee very well but not so much poop. My daughter is breastfed so it is kind of watery and with the baby dry diapers, it wouldn't soak it up and would run out of the back of the diaper. They also made my daughter break out with a rash. Overall I wouldn't get these again. Go with the Pampers Swaddler diapers."
11803,0,a little small,"I have been using the sensitive since my son was born. I love it but since baby dry and swaddler is cheaper, I figure I try them as well. I found that the baby dry seems to be smaller than the other two. my son is now 16lb but the baby dry is already very tight. The swaddler and sensitive are fitting just fine."
11805,0,not what I expected,"It might be good for some babies. But I find pamper swaddlers better, which is softer and has a line that can indicate whether the baby peed or not."
11818,0,not a bad diaper,"i'm not a fan of the baby powder scent. when this box arrived smelling like baby powder, it just made me groan. i don't understand why diaper makers insist on putting the fragrance in the diaper. i guess its because they think that we would appreciate something to mask the smell of the contents going in the diaper. i just think it makes it worse. otherwise the diaper is not too bad but it was definitely a little more leaky than some others that i've tried."
11823,0,"OK, but have to change more often than other diapers","These diapers are ok for the price. We've thankfully never had a poo leak, but these will leak urine if left on longer than a couple of hours. Forget about even trying to use them overnight! I made the mistake of putting one on my son before he went to bed and he woke up in the middle of the night screaming because he was soaked. Luvs are cheaper and seem to hold liquid better. I'd probably choose those over the Pampers Baby Dry, but we will use up the ones we have left since they are just fine for daytime wear, when the child will be changed more frequently."
11835,0,Pampers size 4 diapers,"The elastic in the wasteband is great and fits my little one comfortably. However, Pampers in my opinion doesn't hold as much as Huggies. There have been several times that my little one has woken up with wet clothes while wearing Pampers but that is rare when he is wearing Huggies."
11837,0,"fab product, but overpriced","I used to buy pampers from Amazon through the subscribe and save program with free shipping. Amazon switched to Huggies in their subscribe save program and dumped the free shipping. The 252 count of size 1 baby dry is $42.99 at Amazon and $32.99 at Babies-R-Us. Plus Babies-R-Us gives me coupons every month for $10 off when you buy 2 boxes, or $7 off when I buy one box and a box of wipes. I still use Amazon for other things, but not for diapers!!"

This movie was made in 1986 and Scott looks older and less energetic than he did in 1970. There is no battle action. The drama consists mostly of political and inter-personal reactions to the Generals opinions and ideas concerning the defeated Germans and the Russians, both of which were noted in the movie ""Patton.""

11931,0,A bit annoying for my taste,"I am not really a jazz fan, but I bought this after taking a jazz class in college.Putting aside the spiritual theme and the ""John's Gift to God"" comments, I just want to comment on the instrumental music itself. I always get the distinct feeling that it is just too repetitive (in the title track, for instance, that repeated four-note theme just starts getting monotonous), and a lot of the songs don't really end up going anywhere. I have a hard time with this style. It just sounds like a bunch of notes, nothing that I would term ""catchy,"" nothing to latch onto and really remember after it's all done -- which is something I really like about the Dixieland, cool, and Swing styles of jazz music.I start thinking that if this instrumental music had been representing any other theme than Coltrane's so-called spiritual awakening, the album would not have gained as much respect. Taking the music alone, as instrumental jazz music, I have to admit that I grow weary of it fast."

I was exposed to Peter by his writings in the Journal Parabola. I was impressed and thought I would give it a try. He is a informative writer but in this book he comes across like someone who has just had a conversion experience and makes the same point over and over. His latest book is shorter and its ties to the east are informative. In his section on sex and spiral energy, any good book on Qi Quong and the microcosmic orbit does a better job of defining what he mentions about Aphrodite. When he talks about her and Hermes as a dualist process thinker, I think of senses and thought. The book has its merits but is not read to start with."
11944,0,"Strange movie, but good lessons!","The movie's incredible concept was spoiled by the way they wrote Melanie Griffith's character.Her little nephew is a strong young man who stands up against the evil sheriff and risks it all. His father is a man who stands by his son even as their fight to end racism is life-threatening.It was 2 major stories going on at once - the one that didn't involve Ms. Griffith was realistic. Her character and story was just very annoying. Who actually could carry around a severed head for weeks without being caught?This could have been a great movie if her character and story were better.Anyway, I recommend it with reservations. The plot is messy and the story drags."

It has just a mere 3 tracks on it that are arranged!!! a big disappointment for any fan of the music from FF VII. Although these 3 tracks are astoundingly beautiful, it is still not enough to pay out the money that this CD costs! the rest of the tracks on this are great, but they are all taken from the FFVII OST. if you are a FF music fanatic - then buy this CD. but if you are simply looking for good FF music and expect alot - buy the FFVII OST. you will be getting alot more for your money. If you want a FF arrangement album that is OUT OF THIS WORLD and will simply BLOW YOU AWAY - then take my advice and buy the FFVIII: FITHOS LUSEC VECOS VENOSEC album!"
11974,0,So-So Fatima Fiction,"Although an intriguing tale, the author fails to acknowledge that Our Lady's message is one of love and repetence and then substitutes tolerance of sin. Berry's characters are interesting but he takes too many liberties for my liking. A good read but as far as Fatima fiction, I place this book far below Windswept House and Secret of Fatima."
11975,0,"Suspenseful, yet disappointing and anti-climactic","I truly enjoyed the suspense and intrigue surrounding the main character's (Colin) search to discover the third secret. I am not sure how ""real"" it is, but the backstabbing and inner workings at the Vatican were fascinating.However, many of the plot devices, such as the Vatican Secretary of State using Colin's ex-lover as a spy, and numerous recording devices around the Vatican (shades of Nixon) just rang false, as if the author was really stretching. I didn't get this feeling when I read the DaVinci code, of which this books seems like a second-grade imitation.Most disappointing is the revelation of the 3rd Secret. This was alluded to in previous reviews, so I won't give it away. Suffice to say, it's highly disappointing and will leave you feeling cheated.Don't buy this book, check it out at the library!"
11978,0,Just some simple problems,"I really DID enjoy this book, but there were a few problems that left me shaking my head. The death at the end of the book was completely unnecessary. I would have liked to see a plot twist at that point and hell...I don't know...fake him out with some tic-tac's or mentos.The story is pretty basic: the evil church leaders...but I had trouble feeling anything for these charecters. Maybe a littel more development is necessary.I DO NOT agree with the reviewers that hammer this book because of it's message. The dogma created by the church is the whole reason that such a message IS plausable.Took me a few hours to knock this one off and it's a ""pass arounder"" for my circle of friends.I just hope the next book is better."
11979,0,Not Berry's best... save your time,"Of all of the Steve Berry novels, this one happens to be the slowest one he's written. It's also, in my opinion, the worst book he's written.While Berry is always detail orientated, here he just gets bogged down in details. Further, he never really seems to get to the point. The ""climax"" of the book is really more of a stifled yawn.I have a firm policy about reading a book all the way through... however this time, I almost didn't make it. Too few details, too many threats, too many political ""intrigues"" without the excitement to back them up & not enough of Berry's famous nail biting, adventure with death right on the hero & heroines tale.Avoid this one... it's just not that good."
11980,0,The Secret would start WWIII,"I enjoyed the read, but the secret was really out there. I tried to imagine this much intrigue in the Vatican and that was probably the most amusing of all."
11985,0,Interesting,"The social system of the Technocracy and the way they and other ""sentient"" races interact is quite interesting. Festina is a great character who's more than able of taking care of herself. The fight to get off Melaquin and to keep Jelca from destroying the world is good too. I liked the writing, the pacing, and the way the novel was formatted.However, once extremely irritating facet of this book kept it from being a solid 4-Star: Oar. Snooty, whiney, blithering, Oar took a lot of my enjoyment out of this story. She got under my skin and not in a good way. Her personality was grating. She could have been a much better character."
11990,0,A bland SciFi to fill in a few hours,"Explorer Festina Ramos, her partner and a crazy Admiral are all exiled to the planet-of-no-return. They are expendable because they are ugly or freaks. I have to admit I had somewhat expected a comedy with this novel, and while it does raise the odd mild laugh in the end its not a really memorable novel or one that I really want to keep.Somehow Festina and her woes of being exiled fail to raise a great deal of tension. Her problems turn out to mostly reasonably easily solved and the book slides by like a bland desert. I know that there are other books in this series, but I have to say that this first instalment does not make me inclined to seek them out."
11991,0,Unresoved Conflict,"Patterson does a fine job of presenting the 26 years between watergate and Bush v Gore but only scratches the surface of the underlying stories that were there. I believe he does not sufficiently cover the dramatic effect Watergate had on the executive branch of government. It empowered the legislative and judiciary branches more than they should have ever been, ever intended by the Constitution. It caused the Presidents that followed to be less-endowed with the executive powers they were intended to have and made the word ""-gate"" into a suffix that described every stumble an executive encountered. It made the American public too distrustful of our leaders, granted it was a failure of great magnitude, but we have since graded any political individual warily."
11992,0,Informative But Never Captured the Times,"I found the two books by Patterson, Grand Expectations and Restless Giant, to be the two weakest of the series. I lived through those times and he caught all the cliches of the times, but didn't capture the times themselves. That said, both books were informative and worth reading."
11993,0,More Sociology than History,"This series is generally excellent, but Patterson's effort here drifts off into more sociology than history. He predictably dislikes Nixon like 99.5% of academics. This volume was something of a disappointment."
11994,0,Superficial,"This is a rather superficial book with questionable value. It presents 31 Jack Welch's slogans and without almost any discussion declares them genius. Jack Welch is a very interesting manager whose methods and results deserve a lot more detailed approach. Each of the slogans or ideas should be analyzed, discussed and explained on a good example. Otherwise, as the book is written, the ideas can not be taken seriously by any professional. This book serves as a good introduction to Jack Welch as a manager, but if you want to really learn something, better buy a different book."
11997,0,Looks are Deceiving,"I purchased this book as a brand new knitter looking to learn from a book. I was attracted to it because of the cover art, the fact that the book can be freestanding, and the beautiful photographs of the stitches inside. I also liked the look of the designs of the patterns. I won't say this is a horrible book, because it does have some good qualities, but it is not for beginners, as it does not provide detailed explanation in most of the patterns. I also found some errors in some of the patterns, which I thought were on my part, but I went to a knitting store and asked the owner and she said it was not my error, but the book's. The sock pattern, in particular, will make a sock, but with a very awkward feel and fit. I think these patterns are much more suited to the intermediate knitter who can catch an error before it is too late. That being said, I do wish more pattern books were free standing like this one--it made life easier."
11999,0,LeGrand's Real Estate,"Fight The Good FightI've paid thousands of dollars to attend Real Estate seminars and have been a full time Real Estate investor. LeGrand is the king of selling product. The books are well worth the investment because you can usually learn enough to earn many times what you paid for the information in the book. On the other hand the seminars & courses are really pricey. Many people spend upwards of 20-30k on seminars without ever doing a real estate deal. LeGrand's greatest student is probably Robin Thompson, the Queen of Rehabs, who has become a millionaire many times over using his techniques (I'm one of her students). I have a good friend who spent 5 grand for a LeGrand course and never made any money with it. In essence it all depends on the person. Some can take these techniques and become wealthy. Others can't."

Anything from lower/higher and even/odd to chances a lotto number will come out. All the theory is all good but I haven't found any good results using it. The book is well written for entertainment purpose but the results are no different from doing Quickpick or manual picks on your own.

The vaguest of themes is hinted at in the tiniest of ways and some tracks have a touch of feeling to them but nothing to impress significantly.If you want a CD in which a few lesser genres such as jazz, blues and mellow get the weakest of workouts then go ahead and get it. A excellent example of modern day video-gaming scoring it certainly is NOT."

12046,0,Not a DJ (and no kick!),"Kid Loco's fame is not based on his skills at the turntables (which he picked up barely two years ago) but at the production console. Hence, there is no amazing mixing skills in this latest volume on the excellent `DJ kicks' series (and the new Kid Loco pieces are very disappointing). The real virtue of this CD is the selection of down tempo tracks: from Underworld to Jazzanova, from Future pilot A. K. A. to Bloomington's very own Lisa Germano, from Jazz to post-rock experimentation, Kid Loco's set is a who's who of this electronica genera."
12047,0,Kid Loco-Are You Crazy?,"Although Kid Loco has had several great 12"" singles and a few good remixes he was not the person to choose for the next in the DJ Kicks series. This cd offers a fair overview of the ever evolving nujazz/brokenbeat sound eminating from the British underground-sadly only skimming the surface. Although he does offer a few tasty musical morsels his journey does not lead far from the previous contribution that set an example in eclecticism by Theivery Corporation. Good buy if you are a casual beathead. If your tastes require a bit more than the average fare aim for the innovative sounds by the Jazznova/Compost records crew who steal the show on this collection and also top it on their own recent complilation Future Sounds Of Jazz Vol6."

12060,0,"Ornamentals, Ornamentals, and Ornamentals!","I bought this because I love Nova Scotia and homesteading (and own land there where I hope to live). This book is one couple's experience trying to live on a remote farm on Cape Breton Island. It has some good information, but is less about homesteading than about growing flowers.The most detailed information was on the different flowers they grew - lots about the many species and cultivars they tried. There is a section with some recipes. There is a bit about how and why they came to homestead. There is some writing about landscape design philosophy. But the thing that holds the book together is flowers.The title invokes both the practical and the aesthetic, but compared to other homesteading books, this one is really about the delight of growing flowers in a challenging maritime climate."

Unfortunately, I have found Rainer Truby's work a little stale over the last two years. The problem with most of these albums is that the mixer gets stuck with a trend-setting style, then does not do anything else with freshness. This isn't a timeless piece of work."
12071,0,Slow read but has some touching MOMENTS!,I bought this book as part of the BOOK OF THE MONTH CLUB and started to read it and put it down after about 30 pages thinking I could never make it through. Then a few days later I picked it up again and finished it. It is one of the slowest reads I have ever read and has a horrible ending. It just sort of ends when there is so much more to be told. But the reedeming quality is in the relationships between Jim and his relatives. If not for that it would have received 1 star.
12073,0,Kinda simple....,"""Jim the Boy"" was an alright read however I think that I was expecting something written more for adults and I felt this book was geared towards adolescents over adult readers. It is a really good story-line, however, didn't really make my brain work too much while reading it. What I really liked about the book was the simplistic lifestyle that was described, somewhat similar to that of my late grandfather. So, that was a nice little fictional peak into what it was like for my grandfather growing up in that time period."
12075,0,Warm,"I appreciate Tony Earley's craft, his simple, yet keen prose, masterfully guided. Yet, Jim the Boy is a novel in which lofty, sentimentalized ideals outweigh and ultimately obscure the characters. What resonated with me after reading the book was the unrecognizable face of Jim as a real boy."

12082,0,Cash the Bad Guy,"Cash plays a villian who conspires with a mobster to rob a bank by kidnapping a banker's wife and demanding money. He plays a kind of derranged villian who hasn't a problem killing another person (except children). It's a decent, low-budget film, the kind of film you'll see on a Saturday afternoon on television--nothing remarkable. His acting is a bit stiff. He sings the song, ""Five Minutes to Live."" I've seen him in other, more exellent films. This one is for a collector."
12091,0,Interesting Food For Thought!,"As an early modern historian, well, a student of history, I have to give this book only 3 stars. But as a reader, I give it five stars. My first year of university was dominated by studies of The Wars of the Roses and Richard III - in English and History. A friend gave me a copy of Ms. Tey's book and it got me thinking about the bad rap Richard III has got. I have since delved deeper into the mystery, at least as far as the resources of the University of Western Australia's library will allow, (and this is a lot as it has a fantastic collection of History resources), and have decided that Richard III wasn't AS bad as he is made out to be. The Daughter of Time is an entertaining and thought provoking fiction. I reccommend it for all amatuer historians out there. It opens your eyes to the bias of history."
12092,0,Not really a novel,"This isn't much of a novel: the author's characters are flat and interchangeable; they pale to the point of invisibility beside the information provided about Richard III. Richard is the reason to read the book--forget about its being a novel, and just read it as a document exploring the history of Richard III and the other possible interpretations of the historical records of the king's reign. Just don't expect to care about anyone in the book other than Richard III, or to have to follow a plot: there's none of that here. But, it's still worth reading if you're a history buff--and especially one interested in Richard III."
12098,0,Patience is a Virtue,"Patience is a virtue. And you'll need quite a large amount of it if you're to read this book. For the first 50 or so pages, the story is rather slow a majority of the time. True, they do have their interesting bits, but they are short and few. However, after the first 50 or so pages...if you're a history buff, you're in for quite a ride! Ms Tey explores every aspect of Richard III's case for and against him in the murder of his two nephews. Her reccuring theme of the fallibility of evidence and the persecution of innocence is strongly present in this novel. Includes a rather ""quirky"" ending that the less ""straightforward"" readers will quite enjoy."

The ink seems water soluble so its best to use water and not alcohol to clean up the ink before installing new cartridges. HP like other USA high tech industrial places seem to want too much control so instead of just installing what you really need they try to install everything at once. The internet stuff with this machine was too aggressive and would always cause me troubles until I learned you can install the drivers only but you must select CUSTOM installation right at the start or you are given no choices.But I Still Say there is too much manipulation going on of us ignoramouses.
12112,0,Still searching for the trailer,"As you probably know, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a great movie. Unfortunately, the DVD version offers ZERO extras. No cut scenes. No feature commentary. No 'making of' featurette. And NO trailer (the back cover clearly states that the trailer is on the disc)! Isn't there some kind of law against such blatant false advertising? The picture and sound quality are good, but owners of DVD players deserve more than just a bare-bones copy of the movie, especially when it's a cinematic/special effects achievement of this caliber."
12121,0,Off Key,"For game fans, this movie is not the same. Bob Hoskins is the firm hero who tries to do his best. But the movie can be far off in Left Field. For the movie fan its just a funny way of looking at things.,"
12122,0,Fun,This was a cute and fun movie when it came out and it still is. A great movie to watch with the kids or simply enjoy rewatching for the adults.
12126,0,GOOD MOVIE!,IT HAS SOME ACTION.IT'S VERY ADVENTUROUS AND FUN TO WATCH.THE TWO ACTORS PLAY THE PERFECT PART FOR THIS MOVIE.BUY THIS MOVIE.
12128,0,"not bad, but could have used a little more work","The plot was strange yet interesting, mario and louigi have no powers at all! to do a jump they have to wear special shoes."
12135,0,It pleases me greatly to watch this movie,"I gotta say that though the movie wasn't anything up there in artistic value, it certainly was a good movie to watch. I've been witness to every Super Mario Bros. piece of merchandising and entertainment ever, and seeing the movie and seeing how they related the games and such to a more realistic setting is really intriguing, and right now I'm looking for a good place to buy it."
12140,0,"Some good, some bad","This camera has a lot of really nice features, especially the panoramic ""stitching."" I wish they had paid more attention to picture quality in low light. I cannot find settings that don't make some photos look dark and speckled."
12149,0,Bosch coffeemaker,The product was sent very quickly and the coffeemaker makes excellent coffee. I was surprised that there was no warranty available. Upon reaching the distributor I was told my sales slip would act as a warranty. Rather than returning the coffeemaker to the distributor I decided to keep it and hope nothing goes wrong with it.
12152,0,"Good for the value, but has all the flaws of this value, too","This player plays well, if you OK with the fact that it does not have the stabilizer (so, whenever there is a slightest movement, the play is interrupted). Also, it did not come with batteries (which, I personally hate), and the carrying case included as a bonus is kinda funny looking and impractical. But the LCD, phones, and all the buttons work well."
12155,0,Not to say this book wasn't interesting...,"This book is no doubt an incredibly well researched account of the story behind the Essex. However, it was very dry and I couldn't connect with the people aboard the ship! This made it very hard for me to have any emotions at all while I was reading, and therefore made this book less enjoyable for me! I would only recommend this book to you if you are interested in the story behind the Essex (which, as I said, is very well researched and detailed!) and not in the emotions!"
12161,0,Worthwhile read for true account fans,"First let me say I am a big fan of survival against all odds types of books. I have read and loved Alive, Forever on the Mountain, In Harms Way, etc. This would not rank up to those standards in my opinion. Of course those three books I mentioned had a big advantage - actual survivors for the author to interview. This event took place in 1820 so the author had less to go on. All that being said, if you are a fan of survival books this is worthwhile. A 3 out 5 sounds right on."
12162,0,"Decent Info, But there is better out there","The author of this book surely has a lot of experience with veneering, but in my opinion there are better ways to do things than some of the ways he suggests. For instance he uses regular wood glue (PVA) to apply veneer by letting it dry and then using an iron to reactivate the glue. I would never trust this to hold over the long run and PVA glue is not the best kind of glue to use with veneer anyway. It is to thin and it doesn't dry to a hard glue line so it will allow the veneer to creep with seasonal changes in humidity. He also never mentions using a vacuum press. While a press might not be for beginners, it is the easiest, best way to veneer a flat or curved panel."
12169,0,Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Hoop Earrings,"Bought these recently when Amazon was running a special of $15.00 off on the price and free shipping...So I only paid $14.99 for these earrings. When I received them I was taken by how pretty they were, but couldn't figure out if they were white stones or blue! The blue topaz in these earrings was so light that they looked almost like white stones. In that I was disappointed, but in everything else very pleased. A value at $14.99 but I would not have paid $29.99 for these earrings with the poor stone color. Problem is: you don't know until you get them!"

12173,0,not so flexible,"Depends on your preference, but i found these gloves to be not flexible enough to feel comfortable. The leather linings are the ones causing this.. The item description matches the real product. However, note that it says on the puma package that it is 'goalkeeper gloves' - but looking at how they are made, these are definitely not good for goalkeeping (but it is understandable for these gloves to be as inflexible if they are to be for goalkeeping.) Also, if you are in cold climate these pairs won't protect you from getting cold."
12181,0,Adequate for downloading programing. Too slow for streaming video,"This adapter achieved my initial objective of connecting my TiVo to my router without having to string CAT5 cable. Installation was very easy and the adapter worked great for connecting to Tivo service and downloading programming guide. I ran into trouble when attempting to connect to my Netflix account however. The system would connect, but the adapter was not fast enough to support streaming video. The video would pause to reload the buffer every 30 seconds or so. I suspect the Wireless ""N"" adapter would avoid this issue."
12189,0,Typical Chekhov,"Great, here are 5 short stories. If you like this sort of thing, you'll be happy; if not, you'll be bogged down by the incredibly long Russian names and bored by the recurring themes of poor peasants, harsh life, etc. Not a great introduction to Chekhov. Read this only if you're a fan"
12195,0,beware some info not up to date,"This is a good starting point for board reviews. It reminds you of what topics you should brush up on. For the price, a lot cheaper than spending money and time on review courses. However, some of the material is WAY out of date! References for answers can date back to 1990s. Medicine changes rapidly so this is not acceptable for me. I studied this with my laptop by my side so I could look up the CURRENT recommendations for certain conditions/medication usage, etc. But why am I having to do this work when they could just have easily looked up the same information I have access to each time they spit out a new edition?!"
12199,0,Water Shoes,"They are okay for just going into the water, they do loosen up quite a bit. No padding on bottom, so not very good for water exercise classes."
12202,0,Could not get past the leading lady,"I am obviously in the minority here as Many other reviewers loved Janet Gaynor in the role of Esther/Vicki, but I didn't buy her as a Hollywood star for a minute. She was too old for the role in the first place, and her hair and makeup were absolutely matronly. She looked like a little mouse next to the statuesque, stunning young woman Norman brought as a date to the party at which Esther was waitressing, For me, Miss Gaynor, in her early thirties at the time, strained credibility too much playing an ingenue. It can be done. See Bette Davis in the film ""In This Our Life"" , playing 21-ish when she herself was 37. Wardrobe, hair and makeup!"
12204,0,Blu-ray is a big disappointment,"The Blu-ray doesn't look much better to me than previous DVD releases I've seen, which isn't saying much, and is a shame. Its been transferred from an available print, but not ""restored"", just cleaned up somewhat. I'm not particularly a fan of this dark and artificial film, but I'm a HUGE fan of Technicolor restorations on Blu-ray which can sometimes be jaw-dropping; this isn't one of them. Its possible that there isn't any better source-material extant and nothing better will ever be available; the original Technicolor materials are often long-gone, especially for the earliest pictures like this one."

12207,0,Poor Public Domain Recording,"I remember watching this classic on Saturday mornings (some years back). Okay - my purchase is a nostalgia trip. This is my evaluation of this recording of a public domain movie:PLUSESMindless entertainment featuring the premier bodybuilder turned actorNot a DVD with movies on both sidesFOIBLESPoor construction of DVD entries/featuresMovie ""special features"" resolve to opening screen (choice of either feature)First feature, Hercules, goes black screen and does not resolve to menu after playingSUMMARY: What can you expect for less that $4? Use a torrent download if you want a better production."
12215,0,Disappointed by the Novel!,"I watched the movie first, starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise and was so captivated by the touching story that I just couldn't get it out of my mind till I can buy a copy of the book and read it for myself. But boy, was I disappointed!! Although the movie followed the novel very closely, I was expecting more from the novel. The story was great but I really feel that the characterization of George and Lennie could be more developed in the novel."
12216,0,Of Mice and Men Audio CD,"Two things prevents this product from receiving 5 stars. One is the fact that the copy I received was scratched and skips in many different parts. The second reason is that the CD does not have any sort of guide to let one know where the audio starts and stops. If one is listening to it continuously, it is not a problem. Gary Sinise does a good job reading the different parts."
12219,0,An okay read,"This is usually read by many high school students and that's how I came across it. Of Mice and Men shows the peculiar relationship between 2 men one being mentally ""slow"", they travel on farms together. This is a good read and it is entertaining. I only gave it 3 stars because I didn't finish the book with a strong feeling about it."
12231,0,Don't remember making this purchase,I really don't remember making this purchase. Was it a download? When was it? I wonder where it went ?
12233,0,"Student on ""Of Mice and Men""","The book ""Of Mice and Men"" was about two men that had been chased out of their old town. They are sent out to find a new job so they can fulfill their dream of having their own land. When something goes wrong at the ranch, Lennie must hide out until George comes back to get him. Lennie ends up killing the bosses' sons' wife which leads to an unforgettable twist that will shock you. I really enjoyed the book. The only thing I didn't like was there were a few boring parts that described the scenery but there's a reason for that. this book if for young adults because of the Aurthors writting style. I like this book because it makes you think and you have to remember everything you read."
12237,0,"Good book, clever plot, lacking something...","We were asked to do a research project of John Steinbeck, the author of ""Of Mice and Men,"" so I have some knowledge of his background and life. I personally felt that he could have done a lot more with this book, even though everyone in the US (practically) read it. The characters, to me, lacked a personal touch, and even though Lennie and George traveled and lived together, there was something missing in their relationship, along with their relationship to everyone else in the book. They lacked a closeness, a togetherness. The story to, me also felt like it was held together by just a few plot ""enhancers."" Although Steinbeck described the setting and plot thoroughly, to me it lacked a past, present and future. ""Of Mice and Men"" did hold my interest and kept me reading past our deadline. I would recommend this book to a reader that doesn't want to get too ""involved"" with the book."
12241,0,Josh Welch,"All together the plot of this...interseting tale of two men(one slower than most) was alright. But there was a reocuring item,Lenny always getting into trouble with women but i guess this was an interesting and dependent part of the plot. The main focus of the book was how this very exploratory man with below average intelligence,Lenny, is being basically cared for and looked out for by his friend,George,who is just tryin to make money so someday he can have his farm with his dumb but sometimes helpfull friend. I myself thought the book as alright but not the best. The whole book is actually not very long and does not tell a whole lot about their past."
12247,0,A story about loyaltie trust and the american dream,This story is one of the best ive seen of recent times.John steinback done well in this book by providing many parrallels and making refrences to lennys animal / child like features and behavour.Perhaps the best parralel in the book is beetween candys dog and lenny.
12249,0,It's the friend whom cares!,My thoughts are this book can be less foul language also even readers whom to like this book not to get much facts down in your mind. I would have to say age group 15yrs.and older because it's words may be hard for some people so that's what I recommend. Mostly this book was okay for me that I know of.
12259,0,Recomendation,"Of Mice and men is a book that I first raed for literature at as an obligation, but after I've gone through the first part with a ""long"" description of the setting, I really started to enjoy it. When you go through the story, John Steinbeck applies his unique tecnique to descrive the characters in a very vivid way, basing the story on a couple of intinerant workers, one of them mentallty retarded, fact that was going to kill him in a near future. The story touches as main themes, reflected in mostly all characters; desolation, discrimination, dreams in common, lonliness and violence (in various aspects). As a matter of fact, this makes a very moving story that can be enjoy by young people such as adults."
12260,0,EPISODE 1: The Lennie Menace,"The book is about two guys, George and Lennie, traveling through California to get a job on a farm. Their plan is only prevented by Lennie's mentally retardation, which runs them into a lot of trouble.This book differs from other books, read in class, not only by the colloquial English, but also by the story in itself.Most of all I like the way Lennie is described in the book although there are certain passages in which the description becomes untrustworthy. Some of his statements don't fit to his behavior and the other way around. In my view the ending is not chosen very well. There must be other, better possibilities for them, except .... !All in all it is an interesting and entertaining book, which gives you the opportunity, among the entertainment, to gain more information about the social circumstances during the time of the depression in the United States."
12262,0,I thought that this book was good but it needs more detail.,Overall I thought that this book was good. Although I did think that it needed to go into more detail about the characters and their actions. I also thought that this book taught a good lesson about friendship. I didn't like this book because first of all I thought that it was too short and that the book moved too fast and didn't embellish enough on the past and present events that had occurred in the book. Overall I thought that it was a good book.
12264,0,THE REPORT,"My reportTravelling across America in search of who are now they do it on cycles, in cars, by bus or in time honored tradition of foot and thumb. The wanderers of today may wear the long and speak a different jargon, but their trip is one that men and woman have taken for as long as this country has been pushing at its frontier."
12265,0,what I thought about Of Mice and Men,"I think the story is action packed. Where Lennie killed his puppy and Curley's wife, George killed Lennie, and Carlson killed Candy's dog. All that made me excited. I didn't really like the part where George killed Lennie. They could have run off to a different state or something. Above all I think the story was great."
12271,0,Who Moved My Soap? not Andy's best....,"I enjoy Andy Borowitz's daily newsletters much more than I did his book, 'Who Moved My Soap?: The CEO's Guide to Surviving Prison: The Bernie Madoff Edition"". The book was rather silly and simply did not get me laughing. I had greater expectations for Andy's book and they simply were not met. I appreciate all the time and effort Andy puts into his work and making it available to the masses."
12272,0,Wrong Edition,This is not the 2009 Bernie Madoff edition of the book. It is the original 2003 edition of the book. While it is a funny book it is not the book advertised.Who Moved My Soap Prepack 6: The CEO's Guide to Surviving in Prison
12280,0,I will waste my time and your's,"This review is not going to say anything that hasn't been said about Adam Sandler movies before, but I believe this is fitting, seeing as Sandler hasn't given us anything new since Billy Madison. Don't get me wrong, this movie has its funny moments, coupled by a really, really cute love story that will lead to some ridiculous conflict, which is eventually resolved and where upon Sandler ends up with the woman of his dreams. Of course, this sums up just about every Sandler movie out there, but I did think that the ""Memento"" twist in the story was kind of interesting. So, I won't say this is a bad movie, because it's not, but you could get the same story from any of Sandler's movies. I realize that this review is pointless, but I'm bored and feel like criticizing something... viva la internet."

12300,0,My Headband That I'm Way Too Excited About,Its a little smaller than I thought it would be and it really has to be bent into shape before you can use it. If not it sits awardly on your head and is uncomfortable to wear. Also its definatly a novelty item. Anyone who is looking for athentisty should look further. But if ur a geeky little twerp like me who has an unhealthy attatchment to a certain rouge ninja you'll love it. I wore it for halloween and I felt the coolest nerd ever. All my friends were jealous :p
12307,0,Listen before you buy.,"If you think this is the same voice you heard on the show you're wrong. Somebody has turned that beautiful voice into a bland, ordinary one that sounds like any pop singer out there. On top of that the songs are as bland and ordinary as the voice and they all sound the same! On the American Idol show Clay had the kind of voice where the music is secondary, meaning you didn't care what he was singing you just wanted to hear the voice. On the CD you need to like the songs because there is no other reason to buy it.I gave it 3 stars since it is an average rating for a strictly average CD. If Clay had sung the way he sang on the show there wouldn't have been enough stars in the sky to rate it.Get the AI Christmas CD - he sings ""First Noel"" in the show voice, beautiful!!"
12313,0,"It's good, but not great!","After listening to the CD, I was a little disappointed. I think some of the songs were flat and didn't allow Clay to optimize his tremendous voice range. I think it probably was rushed. I wish ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" was included on it as well."
12317,0,Amazing voice...not so amazing song selection,"I think Clay has one of the best voices I've heard in a long time, but this CD wasn't what I was expecting. I suppose I was hoping for more of a Broadway feel, and this album is very much a pop ballad CD. Dare I say...sappy? Don't get me wrong, sometimes I like sappy, but it can be overdone. I still love Clay! I hope the next album will be a little more experimental."
12324,0,Nothing Outstanding,The CD is o.k.. I did not like the songs that were used. Clay has a much better voice than this music allowed.
12330,0,A Disappointment,"I began watching American Idol because a coworker raved about Clay. I continued to watch because his voice was so beautiful it was heartbreaking. I waited for this CD and thank heaven I listened to clips first on the internet so I knew not to buy it.His glorious voice has been changed to a bland, ordinary, sounds-like-every-pop-star out there voice and the songs are only average. I was afraid RCA would do this to him.I gave the CD 3 stars because it's an average rating for an average CD. If Clay had sung on the CD the way he sang on the show there wouldn't be enough stars in the sky to rate it."
12340,0,A bit worse than I was expecting....,"Not a bad album overall, but I was hoping for a bit more. It's a hard call to make. For example, Kelly Clarkson's debute featured Top 40 pop hits that were so far removed from her American Idol performances you'd think she was just another fremale star that made it up the ranks (her first single ""A Moment Like This"" is nothing like the album that came over a year later); I didn't care from that at first, but she turned out three chart topping hits. In contrast Clay's first release isn't all that removed from what we've heard of his American Idol performances, there's no major transformation here, it's just Clay doing what he does best. Also his first single (released months ago) ""This Is The Night"" is very much in sync with the rest of this album. In fact it's one of the stronger tracks, so hopefully this will give you some ideal of what to expect."
12348,0,Too safe - Elton John meets Michael Bolton,"I loved This is the Night & Bridge Over Trouble Water, but I have to say I was hoping Clay & RCA would take a few risks on the new album. If you like adult contemporary, this album will be right up your alley. At times, I find it confusing as to what song I'm listening to, as they all sound very similar. Would I recommend the album? Just because of the artist's fantastic voice & shear talent, yes, I would recommend it. Would I pay $13 for it? No, wait for a sale."
12352,0,what i think,"i'm writing of what i think of this cd . its a ok cd i will abmit clay can sing have some good songs on here and he seems like a nice guy.The only i don't like is what i read in the johnkarsan review what he said about kelly clarkson. i have to say kelly is not a fake she is the real deal. Kelly is the most nicest , beautiful, humble person ever thats haves a amazing vocie .kelly clarkson will be for a long time and will continue having hits like her renctly song breakaway . so please don't bring down her agian thanks and sorry if i offend anyone anyways good cd clay.i can't for her new cd coming out nov.30th and clays chirstmas one to coming out the 16th of november ."
12356,0,Missed the Mark,"I thought Clay Aiken was a diamond in the rough on American Idol,he has an enormous talent that is not brought out in the songs on this album. I liked a few of the songs but on the whole found my interest waning while listening to it. He is capable of so much more, it's as if his promoters were in such a hurry to market him they didn't see the whole picture of the type of songs he should be involved with. I think he would sound a lot better singing more the style of the old standards than the teeny bopper tunes. Hopefully this is just the start of a very long career for him, he has so much to offer with his talent, I wish when Neil Sedaka offered on AI to produce his first CD they had taken him up on it, the song writers on this CD were mediocre at best."
12370,0,"Quirky, strange but interesting","I don't want to give details here because it would spoil the movie for you. I just want to say that this was an interesting, creative movie. It wasn't at all what I expected from reading the DVD cover. There was a twist I can't go into detail about without giving a spoiler. Regardless, I found myself very interested all the way through. Watching this movie was kind of like working on a puzzle, and the viewer has to solve it. The lead actor was excellent and the story was, well... strange but intriguing. I don't know anything about the behind the scenes issues with this movie, but I'd guess it was low budget, independent film because of the style of shooting and the quirkiness of the story. I would say that this would be a movie to rent if you have already seen those on the top of your list."

12381,0,the sunday tertulia,"For years I was one of the guys. It is only since graduating from college and joining the ""real world"" that I've developed girlfriends. This book made me think of our girls' night out meetings over coffee and wine, times that I both need and treasure.I had been expecting more of a novel, more details about the characters' lives. The chapters, instead, were a brief statement of the characters' current lives and the reactions of the tertulia attendants. I did feel like there was wisdom and truth in the women's thoughts. One thing I did especially like was that the author made sure to provide translations of the Spanish comments and proverbs."
12384,0,He may be an influencial musician but.........,"He was an influencial musician yes. He did a lot for music yes. And that is admirable. But it doesn't change the fact that he was and most likely still is a woman beater. In this book he tries to justify it. And that's not right. I think his music is great, but I don't care how great it is, I will never have any respect for him because he thought women were just objects for his amusment. And he obviously still does. He may have learned something from his hard earned experiences, but not enough. I feel sorry for any woman who ever dates or marries this man. Tina Turner did the right thing in leaving him, and she has more strength than he ever will."
12388,0,a little disappointed,"It has a nice sleek look and seems like it will be more durable than the regular ones. The only downside is that this was purchased to take things back and forth from computer to computer-and should be able compatible to anything. However, it does not work with an external USB hub-which just happens to be our main purpose for it. So we're back to using the cheaper/ plainer version.My husband and I have the same ones except his is the titanium version, and he's still always having to rely on mine, b/c his is not compatible. It seems like if one SanDisk 2 GB flash drive would work on an external USB hub-one with a titanium cover would also-but no-it doesn't."
12392,0,ecm production overwhelms,I bought this album after hearing the duet between Rava & Petrella (trombone) which is a delight. After several listening very little of the rest of the album comes close to the immediacy & intimacy of this piece. I believe the ECM production has in this case overwhelmed the music in a too beautiful & shiney sugar-coated casing. I prefer the earlier album(s) Rava made with Rosewell Rudd on trombone that exuded a rough vitality. Never-the-less there is still some exceptional moments to be enjoyed provided you can squint your ears through the ECM glare.
12394,0,not stellar,"i bought this because rose tinted glasses was so good. i dont know about these tracks really. they would be tolerable if they were mixed continuously. if hes such a good mixer, he could have easily mixed this album together. anyway, its an alright CD"

12425,0,Shows its age,"Unfortunately, ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" shows its age. While the story is, actually, quite good, the language is somewhat stilted and the book takes a while to really get going. I think many young readers will be puzzled by the vocabulary and will be bored. Eventually, the story picks up. However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better. I think that the Walt Disney movie is a much better bet if you want to expose your child to a story that was a true classic. This is one of the few cases where a movie has an advantage over the written word."
12429,0,"20,000 Leagues....","I had to read this book for a Summer Reading Project, and I felt that this book was very advanced.

I think it's so famous just because of Verne's fantasy on making tha NAUTILUS."
12436,0,"Dry, but good Read","It is a good book, but overall, felt like half the time he was overly descriptive and made it DRY, got 70% done and tried to finish it, but had to come back to it... Felt as though the Prof does want to stay but the other part of him wants to leave, half the time is spend describing things, or fish, or coordinates, and history, it is a very descriptive book, but it does get very dry at times as you want to just move to the next page to stop reading the over drawn descriptions"
12444,0,"Not astoundingly good, but not heartbreakingly bad, either.","This book seemed to be one long love letter to the brilliance of Lorne - kind of off putting. There were lots of great anecdotes, but to a guy in his early 30'swho grew up watching Saturday Night Live in the early 90's it was hard to identify with the stories from the 70's and early 80's. Additionally, the kindle edition probably takes away from the book itself - I found myself having to go online to see pictures of who these people were so that I could identify them."
12449,0,Self Help,"I enjoy listening to Wayne Dyer--his voice is soothing to me; his wisdom is mixed with humor; I can relate to most of what he says. This CD was a little different for me--I couldn't listen to it as I was driving in the car. The breathing techniques (exercises) he has you do, are a little thought provoking and strenous. The other part of the CD--listening to his suggestions for healthy living was more what I expected."
12457,0,A bit of a disappointment,"After an incredible debut with ""The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe,"" I was a bit disappointed by this movie from the Narnia series. The movie doesn't stick very well to some parts of the book, obviously to flash it up for hollywood. The movie also lasts an astounding 144 minutes- way longer than it should have. It tends to drag on, and I found myself longing for the credits.It's a good story for the kids, provided they can sit through the over 2 hour movie. It does promote good values of honor and loyalty, as true to the Narnia series."

12474,0,Washington was a great politician,"I feel that Washington's book was very much like he was, and that is two-faced. It may have been true that he needed white support in order to get money for blacks but I feel that he didn't tell the story the way it should have been told. Slavery was a lot harsher than Washington wrote it was, this book was too carefree in dealing with the harshness of slavery. He wrote the book for the white man to read so that he could get their support and their money. He was the Benedict Arnold of the black folk."

Image quality is mediocre, and the ""special effects"" (of which there are fortunately few) gave me a headache. On occasion, a dancer would be out of focus. On the other hand, the technical level of the dancing was very good, which made the DVD a worthwhile purchase, after all. I enjoyed the performance of the Prince, found Rothbart's idiosyncratic arm motions a bit annoying (although was amused by his sly interaction with the Prince's mother), and overall found the corps to be very disciplined."

12505,0,Good but not Great,"I'm a huge Pinback fan, and i'm also a fan of techno remixes, but i guess when you combine the two i'm not a huge fan. I was hoping for more with this E.P. The songs can get very repititive and the quirks are alittle over done in some songs. This is in my opinion Pinback's worse release, but coming from a band like this a mediocore remix E.P. is far from the end of the world. If you are just getting into Pinback, then I would not recommend this for you; try any of their other E.P.s to get a sense of their more melodious music. If you already know and like Pinback then this release would be a good addition to your cd collection, but don't expect greatness out of this one"

I need the specifications card to properly build my engine, therefore, I'll have to contact my local machine shop and see if they can help with finding that information.To all those interested, be careful about what you purchace from Amazon sellers. They mean well, but tend to fall a little short sometimes."
12529,0,More Astrology Than I Ever Wanted to Know,"I was drawn to this book by its title. After a good start with the early history of the planning of the capital by George Washington and L'Enfant, including freemasonic influences in the foundation stone ceremony and the cornerstone ceremony, the author zeroes in on what is to be the main thrust of the book, his analysis of the astrological signage scattered around the capital area and what that might mean. Perhaps George Washington, L'Enfant and the early capital architects were into astrology, I don't know. Perhaps the sign Virgo has some supernatural significance for the well being of the capital and the country, I don't know. I do know this, one needs to believe in astrology for this book to have credibility for them. To make a long story short, the book was a disappointment to me."
12535,0,Joe's review,"Summer of My German Soldier is about a young Jewish girl who is neglected by her parents and alone until Anton, a German soldier who is being held as a POW, is brought to her town. But now she is doing something against everything she is supposed to be for. She is hiding him away to keep him safe and unharmed. She knows if anyone finds out that her life is over. But this cannot overcome the power of love. I thought this book was OK because the excitement was few and far between."
12536,0,"Good, but missing something.","I think someone said this before that the book is called ""Summer of my German Soldier"" yet the german soldier is only in a few chapters of the book, which is not exactly what you would expect and kind of leaves something missing. Even with that though, it is a pretty good love story with the irony of the younf jewish girl falling in love with the german soldier, and what happens to the girl at the ending is defintily something that is not expected as you reas through it."

However, I am not sure yet if I will reorder these when we are done with them. I think the idea is great though."
12553,0,Sturdy but Flawed Design,"I don't love this bike rack. I bought it for my hatchback, and it's nice that the angle can adjust to fit my car. It also doesn't scratch the car at all with the rubber pads and coated strap hooks, which are both nice features. But the arms don't lock into place very well. You just have to tighten these little knobs down the best you can. I wish they would click or snap into place. Then they wouldn't wiggle lose and always require tightening. The cinch straps are also awkward to tighten down, and don't work great on bikes with cables running along the top, or really skinny frames. There's a plastic molded piece for both bikes that's supposed to let you strap in your front tube too, but it's in the wrong place, especially for the shape of my carbon frame road bike, so it ends up just being in the way and can scratch the frame. Over all it's a sturdy rack (very heavy!) but poorly designed."
12557,0,"Previn Plays, Dinah...Sings?","This is an intimate recording of standards by Dinah Shore and André Previn. André plays tastefully, with just enough variation to keep it fresh and not insipid.Dinah Shore is the unfortunate part. She may have been a lovely person with a warm personality, but unfortunately her voice by this time (she was in her mid-40's) is beginning to show a slightly out-of-control unpleasant vibrato. Because it's a duet, and it's just piano and a closely miked vocal, I have regretted my purchase of this album.There are enough great albums in this format, so I would give this a pass."

12570,0,BADLY PLANNED,"I think this video would be fun if: 1. Donna had a ""how to"" section at the beginning or end of the tape. The moves are complicated if you don't have a dance background, and just as you think you might be getting the hang of it, she changes the move. She never slows down to show you what she's doing, and she goes from move to move very quickly! I have to wonder how much the team had to practice before filming. 2. The camera would not costantly move to the exerciser's upper bodies. If it wasn't already hard enough, you can't see their feet! I found this tape a little frustrating, but maybe with a little more work I can get it, and it will be fun. She is a good instructor, though."
12573,0,"Good on relating to other worldviews, but highly distorts true Christianity","I read this book enjoying it at first, but after moving out of dealing with eastern religions/relativism, I found myself in constant disagreement with him. He seems to embraces the Arminian error, which leads him to suggest ideas that require the use of philosophy over scripture.I really only recommend the first few chapters of this book, but when he moves into Christian apologetics, do yourself a favor and return the book to the library.Edit: Looking over some of my past product reviews, I noticed I called Copan a heretic, rather than (rightly) saying that he's only in error. I changed the language to reflect my growth in Christ when it comes to embracing those who are not in the Reformed tradition."
12579,0,Love it,This is a great bag except my only complaint is the zipper to the main compartment. Because it only zips across and down one side it puts a lot of stress on the fabric around the corner. After I had my bag for about 3 months the fabric began to tear. I called JJ Cole and they were great. I mailed the bag back and they sent me a new one. Hopefully it will last longer. My favorite part is the seperate diaper pad. It works great by itself.

12582,0,"A Feel Good Book, but a weak historical text!","Brokaw does a good job of capturing the glory of the World War II era. He also discusses the shameful acts of our country during this period. However, this book is only valuable if all you want is a skinny look at these times. It is not valuable at all in teaching history because it glosses over issues and events. It is a good book, but not a Great book. For a great book on World War II, look elsewhere!"
12586,0,Expectations Unmet,"I will be the first to admit that Tom Brokaw has a place in my heart and in that of most of America. Unfortunately however, his book does not. Though it offers a much deserved tribute to a great generation- and perhaps a much more important lesson to the youth of today- it was at many points a tedious and dull read.Conceptually it was interesting. Breaking it down into life synopsis' of those who were there was brilliant. However, they often read like a bad book report. ""Here are the facts of this peron's life. Done."" James Bradley's 'Flags of our Fathers' will leave you feeling much more obliged to the Greatest Generation."
12598,0,"Superficial, repetitive tales. No depth and finally tedious","It is not to take anything away from the incredible deeds of the WWII generation to say that had this book been written by anyone other than Brokaw it would not have been so welcomed. The stories really are repetitive - the triumph of goodness, perseverance etc. The format of the book is real pop culture. Surely, these people deserve something better thought out than a group of short stories."
12620,0,"Please, some more.","I didn't know until now that this book existed. What I am doing is reviewing its predecessor, The Meaning of Liff. That, I have to say, is as funny a book as I've ever read. It had me in hysterics, even when I was ill, unemployed and going through divorce. It might not be too obvious to US readers just how funny this is, if you're not familiar with some of the stranger place names (Quaking Houses, for example, is close to where I live in N. E. England. Shaking Houses isn't far from there.) Consett isn't the last course of a meal, it's a nearby village. Why 3 stars? It's provisional. I'm sure that reading this would result in 5+ for reasons given."

12631,0,Solid contemporary gospel.,"This album loses a little steam towards the end. And despite the name of this admittedly talented group, there's no musical concepts that we haven't already heard elsewhere. Having said that, you could do worse than add this to your collection. Best listened to when: driving!NOTE: This artist isn't to be confused with the other ""New Direction,"" a group that is definitely NOT gospel."
12646,0,Excellent Product Except for the Hand Pump,"This product arrived on time and was in good shape when it arrived. I have used this product and it is very useful and the quality is excellent. The only reason I did not give this product a higher rating was because of the hand pump that was included with the product. Trying to pump up the ball to the required size using this pump is a joke. They should not even send the pump with the product. I finally gave up after following directions ( pump up half way and leave over night and then finish the next day). Pumping up half way was not difficult, but as the pressure in the ball increased the pump became useless. After trying for over two hours the second day, I finally gave up and finshed the job with a portable compressor."
12660,0,"Very simple, little disappointing, but my 2 year old enjoys...",I bought this book because my son loves to sing Twinkle Twinkle before bed. I was a bit disappointed with how simple & short the book is but my son does pick it up from time to time... he enjoys the hand-drawn illustrations of the other kids & following along since he knows the words by heart.
12661,0,Great for fans,"This is a good book, but then again it's the only one ever written about Freddie Prinze, Sr. I agree that there are alot of things left out of this book, which sort of leaves you scratching your head. Maybe the book was written in a hurry in an effort to put out some truth. It would have been nice to have a more well rounded story of what Freddie's life was like growing up, which would have included more information about his father and other aspects of his life. Also, there wasn't that much information on Freddie's then wife Kathy. It would have been nice to have had her input, but as the book stated, it was about a mother and son. I really wish someone would write a more detailed account of Freddie's life, he's missed alot, and many of the fans would enjoy it. If you are debating on getting this book, I would recommend reading it, of course it's sad, but you do get a glimpse of what Freddie was all about, through his mother's eyes."
12671,0,Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors,"I have been looking for this title on DVD for many years. This was a favorite of mine from my early youth. This is not to say that I am a fan of Opera or that I believe that Jesus was born on December 25th. As I expected, this appears to be a simple, VHS to DVD transfer. The original video recording was apparently captured and canned as-is, that is to say, no studio overdubbing. Therefore, the lyrics are often hard to understand. Just the same, I am overjoyed to own this rare seasonal production. If you liked this title as a child, nothing is different (except maybe your own hearing). You should still like it today."
12673,0,Not One of The Better Animes I've Seen,"I found it a little hard to get into. The characters were developed alright and the story moved at a good pace, but I just didn't feel much sympathy for any of them. Certain elements of the show didn't transfer to well from storyboard to the screen. Still, it did offer enough emotion and character to warrant 3 stars. The animation style for the girls (very big eyes) didn't appeal to me, but the story overall was decent. If possible, maybe watch a few episodes from a rental or on the internet before buying to make sure this is for you."
12676,0,Good,I enjoy the story line of both movies and the scenery is very pretty. The music is enjoyable and the costumes were very neat and classical.
12677,0,Quality that only VHS can provide...except that it's a DVD.,"""Connecticut Yankee"" is one of my favorite films: it's a pity that the transfer is of such poor quality.I also find it curious that it has to be bundled with another film. Is ""Connecticut Yankee"" not enough by itself? I honestly have no interest in the other film.Plus, although the film is a must have, it's a bit pricey at $12.99."
12682,0,A so-so movie from Hitchcock,"I have to say, I didn't really enjoy this movie. I would recommend renting it before considering purchasing it.I found there to be very little chemistry between Gielgud and Carrol, and Peter Lorre seems determined to steal every scene he is in. The story was a bit thin as well."
12684,0,A pleasant read over all....,"I thought this book was enjoyable to read. Say, a decent book to read in the park on a nice afternoon. Nothing too intense. It was a little slow in the middle, but still had enough interesting stories to keep the reader going and find out what happened to this young woman. It picked up the pace toward the end, almost putting off too much for the end; the intense reunion with her father, graduating Harvard, and plenty of wrestling team metaphors for her growing self-realizations -- all within the last few chapters. Compared to other books I've read, it wouldn't be a 5-star because it wasn't particularly life-altering, funny, witty or original. A well-rounded 1st novel for Summer though."
12696,0,The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (Widescreen Edition),"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (Widescreen Edition)~ Alec Baldwin is a very good series. However, the movie is not great or that funny. Sure it has its moments like when Spongebob gets ""drunk"" on ice cream and Garry falls in love with the mermaid or the ""thug bar"". Still the story feels rushed and not that well developed and some charachters that have a much bigger part in the series basically get no air time at all. The kings daughter is just annoying and I find it to be such a pc move that it looses the edge that the show has which the movie is completely lacking. Still and all the movie gets the three stars that it rightly deserves."
12718,0,UK Records Singles Collection,"UK Records Singles Collection being a compilation of 10 cc and contains all their singles released 1972-1974. 10 cc's sound is a mix of pop, rock, art rock and soft rock. The booklet contains all the sleeves for the singles and linernotes written by Mark Brennan. The compilation is uneven with good tracks such as ""Waterfall"" and ""18 Carat Man of Means"", ""Wall Street Shuffle"". The earlier tracks sound silly and first I thought the song ""Donna"" was a parody. 3/5."
12719,0,Sincere Blues,"They're certain to hate it, but Akron's The Black Keys are going to be compared to The White Stripes. Which is shorthand for: they're a combo that adores the blues. On The Big Come Up, guitarist/vocalist David Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney sound like they stepped out of the Mississippi delta listening to John Lee Hooker (vibe), Creedence Clearwater Revival (structure), Jimi Hendrix (vocals i.d.), and, um, DJ Shadow (rhythms). In a rock season where everything old is new again, it remains to be seen whether this twosome produces work that will hold up in the blues canon. Yet they never seem inauthentic in their retro leanings - sincerity counts for a lot with the basics. In five years time, The Big Come Up might sound just as good as any other great blues joint that seems old as the hills and immediate as tomorrow's news."
12724,0,Nothing special.,"I bought this book in conjunction with The Four Agreements... A friend recommended that I buy both books. I was disappointed.As previously mentioned in my review of The Four Agreements, the books are easy to read, but I do not see anything special in the topics discussed throughout the book.

12748,0,Sickening true stories of depravity,"This book is hard to read. It is hard to wade through the cruelty.There are stories here of families being split apart by an uncaring master class. Children were callously sold and permanently separated from their parents. Husbands and wives were similarly split up.Frankly, it makes you sick.Then there are the stories of brutality. Again it makes you sick. How could the slave owners have sunk so low?If you are looking for well written stories that bring the institution of slavery to life for you, this is not the book. What you get here are very short and very simple reports by individuals. There's nothing here that you didn't know already. This is not a great work of literature.This is just a punch right in the nose to make you wonder how slave owners could have been so cruel."

It's a little annoying, but it shouldn't stop Oasis fans from enjoying this one.These were tough times for Oasis (according to VH1's Behind The Music), so you can't blame them for at least trying to make one epic of a record.My favorites include ""Stand By Me"", ""The Girl In The Dirty Shirt"", and ""Don't Go Away"". Multiply those by four and you've got yourself another ""What's The Story Morning Glory"" on your hands."
12764,0,Sing me something new... NOT!,"From ""the biggest band in the world"", this album sounds fittingly big time, but at the end of the day it's still stuck in pub-rock rut even as it tries to expand its musical reach. Noel Gallagher's lyrical rot persists, Liam Gallagher's still belting (they call it ""singing""), and the ""other three"" members are still, well, the ""other three"". But I'm still mad fer it, so here's an extra star for the catchy tunes and the effort, lads."

12770,0,A Princess of Mars,"I read this book as a young teenager - around 14 years old. I actually read the whole series and loved them all. I recently saw the movie John Carter on TV. I never realized that it was from this book until I saw it- the name John Carter didn't sink in. If they had kept the book name, I would definitely have known. I decided to reread the book and see how closely the movie followed the book since I forgot so much as I am now 62. I am still thoroughly enjoying the book. It grabs you from the beginning and I am now 3/4 done and it is still grabbing me. I gave it three stars because it is not exactly a literary work of art, but most books aren't in my opinion. As for being a good, exciting, unusual read...I give it 5 start. i will probably read the next book as well"

The case itself is sturdy and has protected my TX well, but aesthetically, it has not aged well and looks like it's taken a beating, even though it's only been sitting in either my attache or purse. The case is susceptible to scratches and blemishes that I can't seem to get rid of, no matter how hard I try. Although I should remember that ""looks aren't everything"" and that this hard working case has done a great job of protecting my TX these past 2 years, the metallic silver version is not for me, so I'm ordering the black version as a replacement."
12786,0,Psychology 4th edition,I received the book a little later than I would have wanted. The delivery standards given seem to make you think that it will arrive in 2 -3 buisness day not just it will be shipped in 2-3 buisness days and arrive in 7-14 days. BUT the book was in great condition and I would purchase from the same vendor again!!!!!!!

12796,0,Smooth as silk,"I appreciate talent and Engelbert is top of the line of God gifted vocalists. I am just now re-discovering and purchasing all his recordings because he is that good. This Cd is smooth as silk just like his voice and while not his best its still not his worst either. Several cuts stand out like Definition of love, How slow we go, I want to wake up with you and his better than the Beatles version of Penny lane. He does a couple country standards and throws in his attempt at rocking but over all not a bad Cd by one of the worlds greatest singers."
12797,0,Emperor rules!,"This recording includes the first 7"" ep:s from the five great ones: Ancient, Arcturus, Dimmu Borgir, Emperor and Immortal. For my opinion, Emperor and Ancient was the best of these and Emperor's ""ancient queen"" is one of the best tracks they ever made. Arcturus is good too, but Dimmu and Immortal weren't their best in this album."
12800,0,Need to see it to believe it,"I've read the Chi Running concepts and they seem to make sense. But when I try to put it into practice, I have all kinds of trouble with lower back pain. If there were a reasonably priced chi running clinic in my area, I would definitely attend because I really would like to run with little to no knee and leg pain. The author makes it sound so easy but it's not."
12802,0,Take what you want from it,"Sorry, but I don't think Chi running is too terribly different from the older ""pose"" method of running described by Coach Alexander Romanov. A few important adjustments, but not a ""revolutionary approach."" This might be a very good read for new runners or runners who have never considered their form.The author implies that Chi running is ""effortless"" and that you don't use your leg muscles to run which is simply absurd; if it was there would be no need to train. The idea that you use form, posture and stride to work with gravity is very helpful and spot on, but still, one does have to move and lift the legs."
12803,0,"Enjoyable, common sense approach to injury-free running","What this book lacks in sophisticated, scientific presentation & execution, it makes up for with optimism and good nature. The author's good will and enthusiasm for running as an activity for people of all ages & fitness levels, is apparent throughout. Most experienced runners might not garner too much new information from this basic book, but it does have plenty of friendly reminders about form, technique and style and it's all presented in an extremely likeable fashion.As a multimarathoner, I did come away with a few good tips and ""food for thought,"" so it was certainly worth the time spent reading. I think, though, that it would be of greatest benefit with the companion DVD or a live class, for introducing newer runners to safe sporting."
12814,0,bare bones dvd edition of gallic fluff,"This is a silly bit of fluff but it is fun and looks great. How could it not, with so many terrific French actresses all playing to stereotype as the wife, sister, sister-in-law, mother-in-law, cook, chambermaid and daughters of a murdered man, stranded on an estate and gradually coming to the realization that there is a murderer among them? A 1960's mise-en-scene and appropriately gorgeous costumes cannot entirely make palatable the songs or the plot, such as they are.DVD extras, there are none. You can see the French with English or Spanish subtitles. (Unlike another reviewer has said, there is not the option to select ""8 Femmes"" and see the film without subtitles. In addition, the Languages screen does not let you change the settings except to ADD Spanish subtitling -- at the top of the screen!) The only extra is a trailer. Paltry fare indeed.Worthwhile viewing only if you are a devotee of French cinema."
12821,0,Good Sound / Poor Manufacturing Quality,"I live in Asia and travel alot. I love the headphones, but I have had to have two sets replaced due to the breakage at the arms within two years. Part of my job in Asia is to reduce our costs on equipment, but clearly the oringinal design was flawed on a basic engineering stress design you would not expect from Bose. My third set they replaced for no charge has a design change, however a company such as Bose should admit a major problem and have a recall or replacement, at no charge.If you have the the orignal model it will break."

I havent been rough on it becuase another review said she sent it back after examining the pointy corners that were going to wear quickly. Well, i thought quickly meant about 1yr. if you have beautiful wooden or leather furniture, i would not recommen leaving the cheap clasps fully open as they will scratch or rip your valuables. the chips are thin and have extra space in the holding slot; you can play no less. the out side is gray with black strip. i thought it would be black. i was disappoint by this. maybe i missed something. the quality is terrible... but i got a gammon set and i can buy another on next year. sorry i dont see a place to upload a picture. i think i will opt on the 15"" size."
12828,0,Good Underground French Hip Hop,"You can find a good selection of french hip hop on this soundtrack. Unless you're from Marseille, most artists on this album could be considered as underground. It means that you won't get cheesy songs that give a bad reputation to french hip hop. Rap from Marseille can really hit you hard ! This album is good but for a better french hip hop compilation, I'd suggest Taxi 1 Soundtrack... It's way better."
12838,0,:(,"Upset this cost the same as the other two seasons that had two discs. The price has gone up on the first two, but they were about $15 when I bought them.

12840,0,It's a cute book.,"It's a cute book, and I think our little one will like it, but I'm not too crazy about the illustrations. They are very simplistic and not as detailed as I was hoping. It's mostly just pictures of the child, which is fine and helps with the sign language, but the pictures should also help tell the story, such as pictures of the spider being washed out or a water spout... I'm glad to have it and we will surely use it, but I'm not sure I would order any more from the same company/publisher."
12843,0,"Alright Movie, Bad DVD","I thought the movie started out slow with ""Batman"" not showing up to about an hour into the film but all together an alright film. But I am mad as all get out because I bought the widescreen version from Wal-Mart and then came home to find out that it has no special features. I came on here to find out what was up with that and found that Amazon has a 2 disc version for sale that my Wal-Mart didn't have. I just don't understand why they would release a movie on DVD these days without special features. It has become a common thing for every DVD to get special features especially big name movies like this. There should only be 1 version of a new DVD released so that people don't' buy the wrong one by accident like I did. So now I have to go and spend another $20 to get the 2 disc set. Anyone want to buy the regular version for $15 you can get me on Yahoo Messenger. My name is niner4life8."
12844,0,Did he ever pull out the chainsaw?,"I'm not sure I like Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Everytime I see him, I await for him to pull out a chainsaw and start slicing people. Yes, I'm referring to his role in American Psycho. A role he will never be able to escape, in my opinion. He has looked menacing in everything since that movie. And Batman Begins is no exception.I miss the interpretation of Michael Keaton. Before 1989, no one would have fathomed Keaton as Batman. He was predominately a comedic actor. But he made it work. He was slightly off-kilter and bumbling, but could still kick butt when it was time. He understood the balance and the difference between Bruce Wayne and Batman. Something none of the others could.I'm not going to even comment on them casting Katie Holmes, a girl just barely in her mid-twenties playing a D.A. We seem to be witnessing the same problem in the latest Superman movie with Lois Lane. Hollywood, there are women in their thirties around."
12846,0,Great production almost saves bad movie,"Bonus star for great production.The movie itself is slow, boring, cliched and beyond ridiculous. I couldn't wait for it to end."

12860,0,Interesting but Bad Acting at Times,"Batman Begins is an interesting look at the formation of Batman but some things about the movie is bothersome. Overall I'd say Christian Bale does a pretty good job of portraying Batman but his dialogue delivery is just horrendous at times. The worst occurence of this was when he interrogates that guy on the rooftops and hes all pouting trying to look real mean but just looks ridiculous. And the way he asks him the questions is pathetic in that deep grawl like ""Whooooo""...""Wheeere"" its just pretty bad. That scene alone damn near ruined the entire movie for me. And then Katie Holmes is just crap her role is completely forgettable. I think they probably chose her for this role since she has that innocent look about her which would fit with the character who is idealist and pure despite all the corruption of the city but shes just terrible."
12872,0,Nice mount but....,"this is a nice product, but the only thing that i dont like about it is that it shakes too much, so you cant really watch anything while you are on the road. if the Arm would be smalle maybe it wont shake to hat much."
12877,0,A good vest with weak velcro,"The overall vest was good. However, on the elastic portion where the sewn on velcro begins seemed to be a weak area. only after a few uses it began to tear. To keep the vest from moving around during a workout, I would pull on the elastic straps to get a snug fit. The elastic strap is what began to tear on both sides. Maybe this could be reinforced with velcro sewn on the entire straps. Thank you."
12885,0,Technique video - old school presentation,"This is an instructional video geared towards an enthusiastic beginner to novice classic skier. If you are a keen cross-country skier starting out then give this video a try.Not exactly something you can show to non-skiing friends, the presentation of nordic skiing is very old school. You will have to upgrade to another video at an intermediate level for better instruction and motivation."
12892,0,I thought it was only decent. (Sorry...),"I read the reviews and was very excited about getting this book, but then I found it disappointing. The main character was not terribly likeable (maybe that's just a personality clash between her and I, though) and the plot didn't seem to move very well. Honestly, I can't really remember any true specifics with what I disliked, but I definitely remember the general annoyance and disappointment I had afterwards. Maybe I'll re-read it and write a more coherent review later... *grin* All in all, it wasn't worth the money I spent on it, though I WOULD agree that it was worth the time spent reading it."
12896,0,Not the best book ever.,"I had to read this book to do a review on for a college class. It was okay, but not one that had me staying up late at night to get to the end. I thought the story shouldn't have ended the way it did. It just seemed like it wasn't finished."
12901,0,"If you love action and romance, read this book.","Set against the backdrop of the Wars of the Roses, The Black Arrow is an intriguing look at the life of young Richard Shelton. Richard's life is shaken when he realizes that those he had thought to be his friends are really his enemies, and he is forced to make choices that will determine the course of his life. Although the characters are well-developed and the plot is fascinating, this book is not for the squeemish or lazy reader. The description is not only vivid, it is often gorey. The language is sometimes difficult and a dictionary might prove quite handy. But anyone looking for a well-written, action-packed classic should read this book."
12903,0,Good,"This is a good book but not the best of Stevenson's adventure novels. Intended to be a bildungsroman a la Kidnapped, it is set in Medieval England during the Wars of the Roses. The character development is not as good as several of Stevenson's other novels and the plot seems more schematic. In terms of creating a historically vivid setting. Stevenson did better with 18th century Scotland than with this period of English history."

12916,0,Great quality but too small,The shorts look great but they were too tight. I wear a 38 in every denim jeans and shorts I wear and non of them have ever been tight. Be wary of the size.
12919,0,Good book but tons of typos,This book is really interesting and well written but there are so many typos. Some are just missing punctuation that are easy to over look but there are also words missing in some paragraphs that are really frustrating and confusing. It really disrupts the flow of the book. I'd love to read the rest of the series but I hesitate to pay money for such poor quality. I'm glad this one was free. I reported the errors so hopefully they will look into it because this is a really good book.
12928,0,Feverbirds Claw,"I would recommend this book to 12-13 year olds. I liked this book because of the message it tells you about never giving up. I gave it 3 stars because it was boring and confusing at some parts, but I loved it all the same."

12969,0,Overhyped,"First, the ladder took over a month to arrive from Amazon. Second, the product either sat in a dusty warehouse or was actually used-it had some dings and dirt on it! It is not as easy to manipulate as the some would have you belive and is heavy to carry around. BUT, when you use it, it does feel steady and it can replace several ladders. Overall, I think it's overpriced and arrived in poor condition for an item purchased as new. On the plus side, it does take up less room for storage and can fucntion as a step ladder or a tall extension."
12971,0,Not Queen's BEST but it's QUEEN!!!,"As a huge Queen fan I will say this is not my favorite Queen CD. It's not the rock and roll they were known for and I know that disappointed some of their fans. But one of the best things about Queen was that they were so completely over the top that they had the b#*ls to take a break from their usual sound(as much as I love their R&R) and give this a shot. Even though it's not my personal favorite, I have to give them a big thumbs up for trying something new. And after Hot Space was all said and done they still rocked!!"
12976,0,Queen - 'Hot Space' (Virgin),"Originally released in 1982,this was Queen's official follow-up to '80's 'The Game' lp.I remember that when this album first came out,it would appear that many long-time fans had lost interest in Queen.I do KNOW that their summer,1982 trek of the U.S. was indeed their last tour here.This effort really isn't that bad of an '80's album rock lp.Best track here,hands down is the awesome ""Put Out The Fire"".Also decent is the lp's single ""Body Language"",the straight-ahead rocker ""Action This Day"" and their memorable collaboration with David Bowie ""Under Pressure"".Enjoy."

12999,0,R. Kelly is amazing.....most of the time,"When R. Kelly is at the top of his game, he is one of the greatest R & B singers in the biz. Like pretty much every other Kelly album, there are the standout songs, but the rest are just fill-ins. Standouts on this album are the upbeat ""fiesta"", the emotional ""I Wish"" (both versions), the eerily bumpy ""A Woman's Threat"", the uplifting "" The Storm is Over"" and the slow emotional ""the Greatest Sex"". The rest of the album is mediocre. Had Kelly cut the number of songs on this album, he could have made an album you could listen all the way through, and love the whole thing......unfortunately for us, he didnt."

13011,0,For newly diagnosed thyroid patients,"This book is a good read for those newly diagnosed to thyroid disease. It offers the basic information on thyroid disease (Are you hyper or hypo, symptoms, medication, etc.) without overwhelming the reader. The author is very precise in her explanations also. For those of you looking for answers to more challenging and complex thyroid problems, this would NOT be the book to buy. It doesn't challenge any of the current practices and assumes that you have a simple problem that one pill will cure."
13012,0,Nothing new here,"Why did McGraw-Hill publish this book? It is almost identical (verbatim) to The Complete Thyroid Book except that the latter book includes some additional information. Both books were published in 2005.I agree with the reviewers that mention how basic this book is. If you're new to learning about thyroid conditions and their treatment, The Complete Thyroid Book is a good starting point. Otherwise check out this book or The Complete Thyroid Book from the library and maybe you'll discover a few helpful tidbits."

13052,0,Expanding our concept of God,"The basic premise of this book is that most of us have an inadequate concept of what God is. The first half, subtitled ""Unreal Gods"" is devoted to dispelling a number of popular notions about God's nature. The general thrust is that our personal theologies put too many limits on the Almighty.The second half of the book ""An adequate God"" was, ironically, less convincing than the first. Too much ink was used to promote the ""Jesus was God"" theory, adding that Jesus' message 2000 years ago was all God ever needed to give us to prove Himself to us. Too little space was given to what God is for us here and now.The book challenges us to part with our limited perspectives, but is not entirely successful at inspiring unlimited vision."
13063,0,I'm kind of disappointed,"System of a down. First CD was unbelieveable. This one...well, different story. It starts off good with prison song, moving into needles i am beginning to wonder what the hell happened to Systum. From there the songs on the CD don't sound ANYTHING like the first one. Bands that are alledgedly ""against our government,"" but like capitalism, do this. Keep the ideas the same, but weaken the music. Lyrics to this CD are great (most of the songs) I just wish the music sound was more like the first CD...gives me the impression that System in a way sold themselves out. Hopefully the next CD will capture their older, much heavier sound. I also like serji's voice a lot more on the first CD. :( please come back to us System of a Down, not the band that put their name in a HOLLYWOOD BANNER to cover their CD."
13077,0,Medically accurate but limited...,"This book does not offer everything you need to know. It will help you self-diagnose your infertility problem, but it does not offer much information past the original diagnosis. There is not enough info about the specific diseases or treatments beyond a cursory medical explanation and a description of IVF,GIFT,etc.(this is probably a great book if you are primarily interested in these alternatives). I would have liked to have seen more information regarding natural methods to use with or instead of assisted reproductive methods. It's a large book to buy for such a limited range of topics."

13091,0,Where the Great DM came from.,"If you are a devoted Depeche or electronica fan, then you need this, to complete your understanding. If you need to revisit your roots and you like the music that beat the soundtrack to the 1980's, then you need this. If you're outside of those categories, then this is a perfectly good example of the way good synth-pop was made, back in the days before people took the mick out of the casio keyboard sound, and it was damned good synth-pop too. Unfortunately for it, but fortunately for the four (now three) boys from Basildon, it's pretty much been eclipsed by the standard of work they've since produced. That doesn't make it a bad album though."

13103,0,Interesting patchwork,"I'm a big fan of the graphic novels, so there was minimal disappointment at a few items. Firstly, there were far too many liberties taken w/the source material. Midnite is neutral: Gabriel is actually sympathetic (1st part of movie). There is much borrowing & mixing of elements. It saddens me that they A. Stripped Connie of his cockney accent, B. Relegated Chas (Chandler) to a young, overeager apprentice (I always moan about sidekicks: it seems to be Hollywood's quickie answer), & C. twisted the story around (L.A instead of London, Connie was a suicide, he uses some kind of holy shotgun, that sort of thing). Hollyweird really needs to stick to the original storyline more often. The FX was pretty good, the storyline w/the twin women was fairly original, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars."
13117,0,Bubble Gum Fun x 75 Girl Scouts,The gum kit was pretty easily understood directions-wise. The corn syrup was mostly crystalized but was tossed out in favor of new corn syrup.

I myself have a krawk. I've earned the rare item code from the games but neopets could really make sure they put in a correct code. I tried entering mine but the warehouse keeper said ""sorry this neopet does not belong to you"". Basicly this means this code is WRONG. So if your code works (from the game, not from the card) your really lucky. Don't be surprised if it doesn't though.oh yeah, I tell you the secret for the L.3 racing. When it counts down 3.2.1 Then it will say ""Go!"" you can't move know but start pressing the buttons now.

13127,0,Great guitar work...lazy lyrics,"There arent many albums that are more fun than this for turning up the volume and testing your eardrums. But the ""youre the girl for me...i hope we stay together forever"" lyrics get tired really fast. Not all the songs have connect the dot lyrics. ""Virtue and Vice"" and ""Horsehead"" are bonafide Crowe's classics. But what about ""Heavy""? Perhaps they were intending to be funny with this, but it doesnt work. With lyrics like ""The way you put on your clothes, the way you wiggle your toes, the way you scratch your nose"" this song , after the cool guitar riff wears off, becomes a skipper and perhaps the most embarrassing song in the Crowes catalogue. But its forgivable because on their next release, they got back to the tortured soul search for enlightenment type lyrics on Lions and again on Warpaint. I guess one trip down the cheeseball highway in a bands career wont taint their legacy."

However, the book gives you a true feel for the life and times this great man lived through. The writing is very arbitrary, almost (but not quite) stream-of-conscious, and anecdotal, but enjoyable. Another disappointment is the lack of discussion of the American Revolution and his role in it. But it did give me the desire to read more of this amazing individual, and renewed my sense of pride in my country, as well as its interesting history.

13183,0,better in concept than execution..,"'Erewhon' has all the makings of a great book. Written during the stifling Victorian era, 'Erewhon' is about a fictitious land where society and government behave in ways counter to (the then) modern thinking. For example, machinery of nearly all form is viewed with contempt. And being physically sick is a criminal offense. Etcetera, etcetera. Too bad this 'Brave New World' predecessor wasn't produced by a more a capable writer.So what is wrong with 'Erewhon'? For starters, almost no effort is spent on character development. The leading character, who narrates 'Erewhon', is a young British man .. and that's the extent we know of him. And there is scant plot development. After our young Brit finds himself in Erewhon he really doesn't do much other than lecture the reader on the odd Erewhonian customs. After a short while it gets a bit boring. Mercifully, 'Erewhon' is a short novel.Bottom line: its creative premise is wasted by poor writing. A miss."

I understand that it was an important movie that deviated from the conventional style back then and and it was an early new-wave movie after the 400 blows. I get all the points godard tries to make in this movie. Like emphasizing on unnecessary details(the chat on the street, in the bedroom) and cutting short major events(killing the cop). But at the end of the day I was not very impressed, the movie didn't catch my attention. On the other hand the 30 minute sequence in the apartment between bridget bardot and ger husband in Contempt was intruging, complex and masterful."
13186,0,"Good film, dodgy DVD","The film is beautifully restored. But the commentary by an American 'film expert' is unbelievably annoying - the man clearly has a turnip for a brain, and spouts endless slack-jawed drivel about how the film is just a harmless piece of jolly French fun with nothing profound in it. Give me a break."
13190,0,Fun but HUGE,"This is a great toy. Santa brought it for our 2 year old. Problem- It is so big it takes up our whole NYC apartment. Problem 2- it is near impossible to fold. Other issue is it doesn't come with that many balls.If you have a house w/ a playroom, buy this thing. It'll last for ever and the kids will have fun."
13191,0,Must have lots of room,I got this Megaland for my 2 year old. First off I didn't realize how big it is. If I put the whole thing together it takes up a huge portion of my living room. I usually only put up one part at a time. It comes with two tunnels and three play huts. The balls that come with the color does rub off. My daughter's socks turned pink. I bought a pack of 100 extra play balls off amazon. They are huge and the color doesn't come off. The balls that come with the megaland are tiny and 100 of them come with the megaland and it covers one corner pretty much of the tent for balls. When I set up the big ball tent my daughter pushes it over and sits on it and of course it collapses easy.Easy to pop open not easy to curl back up and put in carry bag. I just fold and stick behind the couch.
13196,0,"Fun, but potentially dangerous - reported to CPSC","Megaland is indeed a lot of fun. Our 12 month-old twins absolutely love it, and we always find new ways to play with it. However, be careful. With rough play the metal strips can separate and cause a severe injury. Below is the text of a recent complaint I made to the CPSC:Megaland by Playhut is a collection of three pop-up tents and 2 pop-up tunnels. The strips of flexible metal used to give the objects their shape and pop-up nature can separate, leaving two very sharp ends that could easily cause a laceration or severe eye injury. Both of our tunnels broke in this way, and the ends of the metal strips pierced the fabric covering. Fortunately, we noticed this in time and threw them both away before any harm could ensue. My guess is that this only occurs with rough play (e.g., children jumping on the tunnels and compressing the strips); however, the fact is that children play rough, and our tunnels broke after only two weeks."
13197,0,Okay,"My son loved it the first few days and then he stopped playing with it. He only goes in the large hut. It also takes up a lot of space. So if you dont have room, not a good idea. The good thing is that you can put it away very easily and then put it back up again. So I'm going to put it away for now and hopefully he'll enjoy it again once I take it out again."
13201,0,good toy,it is a good toy but the balls are rather small and youmust check the seams when they arrive for poor sowing
13210,0,Nothing really new or different,"This toy is a cross between Trivial Pursuit, 20 Questions, and the Magic 8 Ball. It's fun for awhile, and might be fun for car trips, but I got bored with it and it became borderline annoying with the constant questions from the kids...."

13218,0,Fantastic Radio - Horrible Batteries,"The radio worked great for my kids. The range was limited, but better than I expected. It fit good, did not come off, strong case, and even sounded good on both ends. They worked great about 10 times, but then the batteries would not even charge. I have lots of NiCad's and even a timed charging station so they did not get over charged. These special (not to be found anywhere else) batteries are just junk. They are easy to swap, but I am not sure I want to put up with customer service or the price trying to get more."
13219,0,Nice product,"This is a nice backpack with good features. There are all kinds of compartments inside, and a very handy small compartment up top near the handle where you can put keys or whatever that you need quick access to. It has nice styling, including reflective threads in the cinch cords across the back, which add a little safety for night walkers.My only gripe is that the shoulder pads are not all that padded. And there is no across-the-chest snap, like you have with some other backpacks, which would help keep the shoulder pads where you placed them -- so they tend to drift outward slightly as I walk, though never coming off the shoulder. However, I often tend to carry my backpack, rather than wearing it, so this is less of an issue for me."

13237,0,Just OK.,"Another depressing book picked by my book club. I didn't hate it. I didn't love it. It gave a really moving story of what it was to be poor in this country in its early years. Really made you think how much we have now. Also, gave you much insight on the struggles that immigrants had when they first came to the land of opportunity. It was not a face paced book. Took me awhile to get through it. I finished it so that says that I liked it somewhat. It made for an interesting book club discussion. However, it was just too slow for me."
13240,0,Five Star's uneven debut,"Back in the day Five Star debuted in 1985 with Luxury of Life. There are some great tracks on the album, Let Me Be The One, All Fall Down, Love Take Over, Hide and Seek, RSVP and System Addict all make the grade. There are some not so good tracks also though, Say Goodbye, Winning, Crazy all have poor production values. Off This 1st album Five Star had some hits and rightly so, the weaker tracks should have been omitted and replaced with stronger material."
13243,0,"Not cinematic magic, but has redeeming qualities","I actually enjoyed this movie more than its prequel, ""The Heroic Trio"". Usually sequels are lost on me, but there was something a little more honest about this film than the first. The characters are grittier, the plot less focused on gags and cheesy jokes. Anita Mui does a great job with the dramatic material, as does Michelle Yeoh (I would've asked for more of Michelle than her counterpart Maggie Cheung, but oh well).There are still moments where the plot does not add up and things happen simply for dramatic effect, but the movie as a whole works better (in my opinion) than the first. Be prepared for a pretty depressing ending, though.Still... 3 out of 5 stars."
13248,0,Sad and Mad,"Those are the two words that summed up this book for me. When I was through raeding it all I felt was sad and mad. There was a child in it (not mentioning his or her name) that the whole time I honestly felt needed a good spanking since obviously nothing else was going to work. It made me think back to each child who I wasn't able to help and the horrible things that had later on happened to them.Whle this book is good I recommend it in doses as it made me way too angry to read in one sitting. Your typical loveable Hayden children are here, but there is a viper among them"

13259,0,Some good some bad..,"The whole autumn series.. If your not used to actual english style writing, you will possibly find it slow, boring, or annoying in some way. This series isn't too bad with it, but its there. The story is really good, but for long expanses it seems the characters just sit around and whine, for chapters at a time. The action parts of the book are really good, but these long expanses of supposed hopeless despair suffered by the characters, also truely gets felt by the reader, due to how boring it gets to hear some brits whine and cry about losing their families. I guess it's pretty realistic on that part, because the end of the world would be pretty horrible. But it also made it pretty hard to force myself to keep reading each of the books from this series. I think the only reason I continued to read them was because I already bought the whole set, and so I can count them in my collection of zombie books I've read."

Tong storage and or decor is more appropriate than ""bun warmer"""
13275,0,Not enough room for hotdogs,"I was happy when I received the hot dog roller, however when I went to put hotdogs on it, I realized that only 4 hotdogs would fit not 8 as shown in the photo. Needless to say I was very disappointed, but such is life. It still makes good hotdogs and the above shelf steamer area for buns is great. I guess i shouldn't eat more than 4 hotdogs at once anyways...:)David"

13296,0,"An entertaining, ""quick"" read","This 2nd installment in the Temperance Brennan series neither disappointed nor amazed me. There are far fewer terrible similes, ""to say I was cold would be like saying Lady Godiva was undressed,"" but the plot was far too coincidental to be believable. Once again the novel concludes with a Scooby Doo summary, but the crime procedurals are accessible and interesting and the characters likeable. Sometimes. Perhaps that is why I am enjoying Reichs Tempe Brennan series. The lead character is so believably flawed. I am anxious to see what develops between Brennan and Ryan and I can't help but wonder how many novels it will take for Tempe to realize she should at least pack some mace in her bag before she goes wandering off alone in an attempt to assert her self-reliance."
13301,0,Disappointed,I got this book for pennies used from the library. I really enjoy the T.V. series bones based on this series of books. This book starts out pretty interesting. The author did have a few of those moments where she over explains things and makes the book drag on as if just filling the pages with words to fill the pages and I had to start carefully skipping several paragraphs to avoid the boredom. Good reading mostly until she seemed to just slap an ending on the reader that just did not seem to fit very well. I agree with the other reveiws stating book starts out good and then drops off and becomes less interesting. This is the first Kathy Reichs book i have read. I think her editor has let her down on this one as he/she should have caught it. But I guess they are just in it for the money ?
13304,0,I have to say I'm picky,"I'm not a huge fan of Bones, I like Kathy Reichs, and I love the clinical language used in her books. Unfortunately, I get so hung up on the silliest of details. In this entire audiobook the reader actually mispronounces a word and for about 5 minutes I was stuck on that & had to jump back to listen to what I missed. Otherwise, though I'd rather have the time to read them, this & other audiobooks are great for the busy."
13305,0,so far so good...,"I'm only on page 59 but I'm enjoying this book very much. I like the meticulous step-by-step way Reichs describes how bones are packaged and prepared for transportation. Very interesting.I will, however, be a nit-picky reader and point out that in the paragraph on page 52 about the hockey game on TV that Don Cherry's commentary takes place after the FIRST period, not the second period as Reichs says. Maybe this is something only a Canadian (and hockey fan) would notice but it is quite important for realism. In Montreal, hockey is akin to religion for many people..."
13311,0,I agree - an ending that leaves something left,"I picked it up to finish the Foundation series; a good ending, I will maintain. It wraps up the idea behind the foundation and settles it to face squarely with WHY things need to be held together, and the justification for arranging things. It does change the tone of the series and is very long-winded and suddenly ended (kinda like...ok...ok...ok...huh?), but it does finally add some closure to the series and a feeling of completion - a reason behind why he even started the Foundation's Edge. For those looking for a thoughtful read and are a fan of the Foundation novels, I recommend; if your looking for more of a fun read, pass this book by."
13313,0,Yuck. Worst of the Foundation series,"I was disappointed in this book, which is chronologically the last of the Foundation series.The characters act out of character. You have your heroes and your heroine, and in the first half of the book, they're very righteous, debating about morality, and act strongly with conviction. But in the second half of the book, a small event happens and then you get a bunch of whiny wimpy characters. It was really annoying, and if it was anyone but Asimov, a reader would say that he inserted this small event just to build up to another sequel.He could have removed this event and it wouldn't have changed the overall theme of the book. This book just left a bad taste in my mouth -- I was exasperated that our so-called heroes whom we initially rooted for and loved became so stupid."
13316,0,"good, but not great","this is supposed to be a horror game but there are really only a small handful of frightening moments. I haven't played this game in years but i remember it was just ""ok"", and not much more than that."

It did relieve itch, dryness, pain and swelling so I would say it was worth it."

13358,0,It was never easy being a poor woman!,"This book helped me to understand the perils of being a poor woman in Seventeenth Century London. The character Moll Flanders was born poor and she had no family to support her, therefore her only ways of survival was to get married, sell her body, become a servant at very low wages. She chose to become a thief, and to always to appear to be something that she was not.It is almost like a travel book because Moll is always moving from town to town, and from life episode to next episode, across the ocean trying to find a place to be herself and not a fake representation of a good woman.Sometimes the narrator is too detailed and tells more than I needed to know, but it does seem like a woman is speaking, or writing in a journal, even though the book was actually written by a man. I enjoyed reading the book and felt some sympathy for Moll Flanders because of her struggles, weaknesses, and her ability to endure."
13365,0,Hyperspace just a bit dated,"Not a bad book at all, interesting and different perspectives on the same topics that I have found in other sources. the only issue I have is that it is a bit old. 1993"
13367,0,"An Interesting, but Monotonous, Book","This book covers a wide area of modern physics as it title suggests, and does so in an acceptably thorough manner, but the author often repeats himself and often ends up beating a dead horse (or two-dimensial worm in this case) with his tiring examples and writings. Overall, a good book to read if a friend has it and you have no other access to any better books, but not one to buy. There are better, more thorough,a nd more interesting books."

13392,0,Mixed feelings...,"It's a gorgeous skillet and the bottom is larger than other 12"" skillets I've seen or used. You can easily cook several servings at once. Unlike the 3-ply competitors, this has a thick aluminum/copper bottom. Unfortunately, this takes forever to heat up or to respond to gas changes. Combined with a skinny handle, it is very bottom-heavy and not well balanced--difficult to handle, especially when wet. Mirror finish exterior is easy to clean, but the copper bottom will look ratty unless you make effort to polish it. Finally, the stainless interior is of the stick variety. I'm surprised to see the review that says it can be used for stir-frying. It's way too shallow. Use a wok. Overall, it is a nice looking pan that is generously sized, but not as easy to use as I expected."
13393,0,On the fence,"A travel companion raved to me about this makeup and I had to try it. Basically, I like the feel of this makeup. It's really soft and it feels nice when I am wearing it. It's also long lasting which is also really nice. My biggest issue with this foundation is the color. I have really ivory/fair skin and in certain lighting it appears orange. I also bought the lightest shade which is Ivory. If this foundation matched my skin color I would consider buying it again, but the price to way too high."
13394,0,Bubblewrap at its best!!,"Of course this movie was crazy stupid, but that's exactly what it's supposed to be!

I can never look at Bubblewrap again without laughing. It's great."
13398,0,Read Review :P,"Okay, overall, i liked the movie, but just by a smidgen of a point as u can tell, the characters were really funny and the former ""stifler"" and current ""kelso"" were good picks for these parts. Seann William Scott makes really good movies for the teenage folk such as yours truly, and Ashton Kutcher i believe will do just as good. They played their chars very well, but the plot was very strange, they threw in a bunch of different random ideas, and imo, the writer was wasted himself as he wrote it. You never see it coming, but there is sci-fi added to the movie which really ruins it. If they stuck to the going around the neighborhood talking to people idea, it would have been better, but my eyes were rolling when the cult came in asking for the transsomething :P(stupid word, can't remember it). So what i am going for is that if u don't look at the screwy plot in this movie, you'll still like the chars, as long as you're not easily insulted"

13408,0,Library of Congress Remixed,"Here's a great way to make a buck. Take some classic old 78 rpm church hollers and barrel-house rockers and sync in some beats per minute and have people call you a break-thru musical genius. I have to give Moby credit though. At least he's introducing compu-teens and upwardly-mobile handshakers to the shakes and quakes of the old school yard groove. When he keeps the field out of the studio, he creates some thoughtful moments, such as ""Porcelain"". And original collaborations like ""Why does my heart feel so bad"" shine as well. Overall, the album flows nicely and makes a satisfying salute to the joy of music. But has Moby changed the face of music? At the very least he's learned how to program its soul. My recommendation: Buy this along with an Alan Lomax field-recording. Decide for yourself if the tree trimmer has injured any of the roots."
13409,0,Moby . Looks like Fatboy Slim just a lot better,Play is a good album for the people who are new to electronica. I have to admit though Moby could have been more creative. He often uses a voice sample excessively. THat can be a little annoying. I hope Moby challenges himself further in later albums. I guess Play is Moby way to further finance himself. It's to commercial and plus he isn't the first to use gospel and blues singers is electronica. Moby is good but Recoil is better.
13410,0,Moby Gets Jiggy With It,"When listening to Moby's magnum opus, I couldn't help but notice the similarity to benign pop sclock like Will Smiths 'Get Jiggy With It', as opposed to brilliant electronica like Fat Boy Slims 'Praise You'. As much as I enjoyed this disc, it just feels a little too cookie cutter, as opposed to the break through master piece it's been hailed as."
13412,0,"Interesting, but overrated.","I bought this CD based on the nearly breathless reviews I read in WIRED and AMAZON.COM. While I generally found the music thoughtful and ingenuous (despite the vacuous liner notes) it was technically uninspiring.The core of the album is basically 4/4 drum beats with guitar and keyboard arpeggios, and some sampling of some old blues artists thrown in for good measure.If you really want to hear musical genius using the most sophisticated musical tools available today, check out PAT METHENY GROUP. ""Imaginary Day,"" and ""We Live Here"" are both excellent CDs from this remarkable international ensemble."

But I thought I'll read on because it will come back to where it left off. Little did I know it would be the whole book before I found out the rest.I have only read one other of Barbara's books - Letter from a Stranger.

It has a great presentation while it is in the packaging, but I was a little disappointed once we took out to play with it. The horn is a little tricky to honk, and you have to press it at just the right angle to make it sound. The gear shift moves up and down and the wheel turns and that's about it as far as features. Good for practicing hand coordination I guess, but my son did not seem to find it very entertaining..."

As it stands, I will probably never watch it again."

I guess I will just have to wait and read my office's latest memos until a better version comes out."
13438,0,"Silly, Cute and Profane","A pretty silly but good natured comedy with a vague underlying moral message of some sort. The characters themselves are appealing, but the sound track is comprised of hard core rap music with profane lyrics that you may or may not appreciate. Overall, this is not great cinema, but still provides a pleasant viewing experience."
13445,0,Good until the plot kicks in,"This film starts out in a very promising way, offering broadly stereotypical characters in a comically banal work environment. The protagonist's situation resembles that of Ed Norton's character in the brilliant Fight Club; both men occupy boring, empty existences framed by IKEA furniture and jobs of mind-numbing tedium. However, while Fight Club quickly veers into new and exciting cinematic territory, Office Space settles into a formulaic, predictable and utterly inoffensive story about inept white-collar crime.This isn't a terrible movie and, depite relying too much on the single most overused comedic topic of prison life, it does have some funny moments. I'm usually a big Mike Judge fan, but his brand of laziness works far more successfully in a short Beavis and Butthead episode than in this cautious and unambitious first foray into live-action filmmaking."

13471,0,No F for F-Troop,This is a one note comedy series from the sixties. Lots of slaptick bits and jokes that are great in smalldoses. If you watch several episodes at one time you will be struck with the repetition of some of the gags. I liked the casting and thought they could do so much more with more material. The cannon gag is in just about every show. Tag lines are used over and over again. My verdict is OK in small doses. Too bad a talented cast was wasted.
13478,0,"Sorry, There is no Hero.","Wolfe is an amazing author. On a literary level this is one of the best books I've read. The dialogues in the book are marvelous while the writing itself creates some beautifully contrasting and yet similar characters. The book bleeds social and racial overtones that are devastatingly real and yet rarely put onto paper the way Wolfe has. The story is okay, but the lack of a hero left me detached from the whole thing. The book is worth reading however, if only to appreciate the bluntness and humanity in Wolfe's writting."
13480,0,"Good, Not Great","As I first began reading the book several years ago, I thought it was quite intriguing and well-done. As the book went on however, I realized none of the characters were three-dimensional. The situations in which they were placed could certainly happen, but the complexity of character doesn't equal the plot structure. It was worth reading, but it's not something I'll ever return to."

THough I'm more familier with the marvel universe it seemed the DC encyclopedia was more up to date with fewer clerical errors such as mislabeled pictures. Also the entries in the DC encyclopedia were more comprehensive which on comparison of the two I realized was because it had smaller print allowing more information. So really the Marvel Encyclopedia is good for a reader that doesn't have a huge body of knowledge of the MU but readers looking for an encyclopedia as well put together as the DC encyclopedia will be dissapointed which is sad since contributing writers were greats like Tom Defalco, Tom Brevoort, and Peter Sanderson."
13497,0,got the book/haven't read it,the seller got the book to me promptly - i have not had time to read it yet - it's in the to be read pile...it appears to be in good condition.
13500,0,What the heck Amazon.com?,So I bought this book from Amazon.com seller and don't be fooled the book does not have the same cover as the picture plus the book looks dirty! It has black smudges all over the front and back cover of both of the books I bought from Amazon.com. LAMO. When I buy a product brand new I expect it to look new. I'm a little dissapointed but I'm still keeping them to read.
13514,0,Not as exciting as I was led to believe,"This book promises to help you make a bunch of interactive toys. Most of the toys are essentially stuffed animals. Many have pockets to hold other items, a few with magnets or velcro to attach to the child, other toys, etc. The games feature standards like ring toss, bean bag toss, matching, tic-tac-toe. There are a handful of puppets and dolls- again very standard- pop-up, topsy-turvy, etc.Based on the photos of the book, I expected original concepts for soft toy making. The author has a wonderful sense of color, whimsy, and pattern. I had high expectations. I was disappointed to find the usual types of cloth toys and games from my own childhood rather than new and innovative games and uses of materials. If I take the time to make these toys, I just don't see them really inspiring my children's play time."
13516,0,Useful once you are there,"This book is unbelievably detailed when it comes to trails to hike etc. However the book is fatally flawed (for me) in that it has absolutely *no* information about lodging! I am planning a trip to Montana with my three kids and I wanted to know about where to stay in Glacier Park, whether we should consider a ranch stay, and if there were once-in-a-lifetime experiences such as a dinosaur dig or a wagon train ride. Not one of these questions were answered by this book! However, once you are at Glacier I imagine the detailed information about trails and scenery (and a few stores etc) would be quite useful."
13522,0,Too Complex,"The most valuable thing in this book is a longish list of sleep hygiene tips nestled within the four week progeram. It includes things like replacing all the bulbs in your bedroom to those that put out a maximum of forty watts, and taking a power down hour before bed where nothing can be done but mindless chores, hygiene, and stretching. The rest of the book is filled with product plugs and unnecessary facts. The four week program would cause even more anxiety in me about sleeping. For a truly wonderful book on sleep, and one that will help those already on medications without lambasting them, try the Insomnia Answer by Paul Glovinsky."
13538,0,Watch the COUNT!,"Don't buy these in a 32 count box! My order through Amazon with this vendor ended up being about $0.51 each; Most boxes are a pack of 4 (128 total), which comes to $0.21 each. Plus they're charging 2nd day shipping of $9.99. I got taken... don't let it happen to you."
13542,0,Average novel about revenge and redemption,"I wanted to like Peter Abrahams's ""Light's Out"", but I just couldn't. Eddie Nye is almost likeable, as a newly released prisoner, who served 15 years for a crime he didn't committ. We slowly learn how he got himself into that mess, and we learn that things are not as they seem, with Eddie's brother, for instince. The subplot about Nye trying to figure out about ""Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner"" is interesting, but doesn't compensate for the weak ending."
13546,0,MUST SEE - Once,"This used to be one of my favorite movies. The songs are spectacular, and the telling of Fanny Brice's rise to stardom is a lot of fun. Once she has it all, the movie tends to drag. It's an interesting perspective on how we might look at life, however - it's the struggle to get somewhere that most intrigues us. Once we get there, it's no fun anymore. That's why this is a must see once movie - and you will want a CD of the music."
13554,0,Their weakest CD,Troop follwed up thier excellent Deepa CD with this weaker CD. Three of the oringial members left and they gained Demetirus Shipp who produced 95 % of the CD. The first half of the CD are the ballads which are all pretty strong in partiuclar Let's Get Warm which is soon to be one of my mix CD favorites. All in all I guess this CD proves that a group is the strongest with all members. Be on the lookout for a new CD in 2005.
13555,0,"Rhythm, no blues","This new sound (sortof) suits Palmer's formula of sexy lyrics with sexy rhythms. It sounds great, but sometimes his lyrics leave me flat. I guess I've heard him say too many times, ""You're a masterpiece"" so that it sounds stale. Half the album, though, is exceptional listening, including his remake of ""Let's get it on"" and remakes of two of his earlier works. The ending song is a wistful little ditty that doesn't really fit with the rest of the songs, but the album is better off for it. This album does have sexy rhythm, but its lacking a little heart."
13586,0,"Wonderful movie, awful DVD","... This is an all time classic animated movie. So beautiful and touching, but this DVD release, for all the time we've waited for it, looks like it was knocked up in an afternoon. Shabby VHS->DVD transfer with hazy, shakey images and rough sound, no extras of any kind and in 4:3 only. What a tragedy! :-(To everyone that was as disappointed as me with the poor quality of the DVD, I urge you to look forward to the cinematic release of Peter S. Beagle's remake of The Last Unicorn, featuring a number of the original cast. ..."
13592,0,Ok..,"My daughter and I prefer the old VHS edition... with the ""damns"" and with the fuzzy animation over this cleaned up version."
13593,0,Ruby Nose Screw,"In general I am pleased with my purchase. It is a ruby and it is 14kt gold however, the picture of the nose screw and what I actually got were not the same. The item I received had the (pigtail?) not the gentle curve of the nose screw pictured."
13594,0,DeFore Saves This Story,"This film noir was turning out to be a disappointment but picked up the pace nicely with some interesting twists when Don DeFore's character ""Don Blake"" entered the storyMeanwhile, Lizabeth Scott (""Jane Palmer"") was convincing as the femme fatale and Dan Duryea (""Danny Fuller"") was his normal entertaining character complete with some good, wisecracking lines. However, DeFore is the guy who rally snaps this film out of the doldrums.This is a story of greed and what it can do to people, particularly if they aren't that moral to begin with!It's nice to see this out on DVD, although, from what I have read everywhere, there hasn't been a decent print of this movie made available, at any price.....so beware."
13596,0,good movie bad transfer.,"This is a great noir film,but the alpha video transfer is terrible. The scenes are pieced together sloppily and the quality is terrible! I could not believe how bad (by today's standards) they could sell this poor of quality on DVD,but the plot of the movie is great with Lizabeth Scott and Dan Duryea acting superbly."
13597,0,"Good film noir, but Alpha Video version is very shoddy print","Beware. There are two (maybe more) versions of this film on DVD. The Alpha Video release of this is a really shoddy print, with video jumps and skips all over the place. There is dialogue for which you only hear the tail end of a number of times; this is really irritating.The film itself is a solid decent effort; Dan Duryea and Lizabeth Scott are fine, and the standard film noir story of a femme fatale, greed, money, and murder is carried out with aplomb by the two leads, with no thanks/help from Don DeFore as the good guy who is just too goofy to be credible. Arthur Kennedy is OK too, as is Kristine Miller. But naturally, the movie belongs to Duryea and Scott.From what I understand, the Image print is not too great either. Not sure; haven't seen it. But the Alpha Video print is definitely a must to avoid. The reason I gave this three stars is because the movie itself is, as mentioned, pretty good. Too bad about the lousy print, though."
13601,0,VHS,The quality of the picture is not good but watchable.CanIster get it in dvd format?It was s good movie to watch.Only wish the pictures were better definition
13622,0,Dull story...ok characterizations,"I've read all three Poltergeist books and have to say, unfortunately, that this was the weakest story of the three. I think one of the main problems is that the entire story takes place in the Legacy house and sort of gives the book a claustrophobic feel. Also, the ending is VERY anti-climatic (if you read the book you'll see what i mean). On the plus side, i think the author did a pretty good job of describing the main characters (they did remind me of the tv show)...although he did make a few mistakes (early on he describes Kat as Rachel's 20 year old daughter..he also says that Derek is French Canadian). All in all it's an OK book but not the best (i still think Maelstorm was the best so far). Hopefully another installment will be coming out soon."
13635,0,Reading the Other Reviews was a Pleasant Surprise...,"because when this movie premiered in NYC years ago, it was panned pretty badly. Like one of the other reviewers, I too was in the Radio City Music Hall audience, as one of my cousins had gotten free tickets to see it. I know I saw it at least once on TV, on the late late show. Unlike the other members of my family, I thought ""The Slipper and the Rose"" was a pretty good movie. Richard Chamberlain was very appealing as the Prince, and the songs are quite memorable and tuneful.While I couldn't say it's the best movie musical I've ever seen, I nonetheless would recommend ""The Slipper and the Rose"" as a nice piece of entertainment."
13637,0,My take on the Slipper and the Rose DVD,"I was not happy with this DVD. Perhaps it's my 46in Samsung HDTV, but it appears to be a full screen version. I also own the full screen version of this DVD, and I can't see any difference between the two versions. They are both the same length in time and both have the same granular appearance on the screen."
13639,0,Pretty good. A little weird.,Very interesting. Not your typical Disney album. Worth a look at though
13641,0,Cute movie...under-rated!,"This is a really cute movie! After reading the negative reviews, I almost didn't watch it. I'm glad I did! The two lead characters are adorable, especially Carlos J. Da Silva, as the internet hook-up gay guy finding himself in NYC. His acting was natural and really good - his roommate, while a weaker actor, is still an adorable and likeable character and the story line is one most gay men can relate to. There is plenty of eye candy with many cute boys and simulated sex scenes...however, it really is a story with a heart, and a realistic portrayal of contemporary gay life. Yes, it is a low budget movie but, all things considered, a suprisingly good movie! A very pleasant way to spend an hour or two!"
13642,0,"Bad film, great bodies",This is not a good film but the actors are fairly hot. I would recommend it only if you're needing some man-candy.
13647,0,"Not enough here, though still better than her last album","Talented as Larrieux may be, with the freedom of indie control comes the responsibility to hone your offering to the best songs each time out. This record gives us a couple of strong songs and a lot of filler, which is saying a lot on a record that only has 10 tracks on it. If you release a 10-track album these days, it better be slamming (say, like Julie Dexter's records).Notable tracks are ""Unanswered Questions"" and ""Gills and Tails"", which should be on the radio doing what her music does when it gets there: changing thangs instead of being changed by thangs."
13648,0,Morning,"As a fan of Amel Larrieux since her Groove Theory days, I always look forward to her releases. I've had MORNING for a while but still only truly like 5 of the 10 offerings which isn't that unusual given the fact that over time songs from her last cd, BRAVEBIRD grew on me. I'm not disappointed because I love her voice and the courage & energy it must take to continue to put her music out there despite the rigidity of today's music business.My favorite tracks are: WEARY - a terrific, well written song that was an excellent lead single; NO ONE ELSE - a beautifully spare love song, her voice sounds so pretty on this track; TROUBLE - fun song; UNANSWERED QUESTION - beautiful lyrics & production and GILLS & FRILLS - again, beautifully produced track.Fans will appreciate the new music but to those who are just discovering this artist, I'd recommend getting her debut disc prior to purchasing this one since the sound & overall vibes of the albums are so different."
13650,0,Not Free SF Reader,"Still odd, this private investigator.This is much of a muchness with the last book, but the act wears thing after having it done the first time around. Dirk still has dodgy fridge hygiene. The plot if you want to call it that this time has to do with a possible deity, some blowing up of stuff including people, and an annoying album also features."
13658,0,Classic JCVD vs. Dolph,"Although the film is slow as molasses in the middle, this little diddy from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin was entertaining enough to spawn sequels...laughable ones, but nonetheless this fun movie has a lot of flaws but if you are a fan of either of these action stars then this is a worthwhile view."
13667,0,Mehhh,"I liked this season more than the 3rd season, but not as good as season 1, by a long shot! Still, get it and watch it over and over. I tend to pop it in on a lazy Sunday :)"
13676,0,good enough,"The wig seemed very amateur and the belt it just a piece of screen printed fabric. As I put it on I thought it was only worth 2 stars. It was comfortable and easy to wear, though. I received a multitude of positive comments on the awesomeness of my costume so I changed it to 3 stars."
13684,0,"Good, but the others in this line are better","These beer bands are great - but I prefer the ""personality"" and ""bombed"" styles more and here's why. The set of 12 that I got included several colors that were very similar. I don't know about your friends, but my friends aren't going to be able to discern yellow from mustard or teal from green... ESPECIALLY when they've had a few of the beverages for which this product is made. Besides, the ""personality"" and ""bombed"" ones are more fun. Now where's my beer... oh that's right I'm the fuschia... or am I the sea foam green?"
13687,0,Great pot - bad handle,"I loved this saucepan and used it happily for many years. It felt like it would last forever - really terrific quality! But then the handle, which is only affixed by one screw, started getting loose; the insert into which it screwed became stripped; and then some nut on the inside, which is what the screw fastened into, became loose. The handle fell off, and it can't be fixed. What a crummy end for an otherwise great pot! It's made me quite leery of buying any other Faberware products."
13689,0,Buy the regular version - unless you like bees,"The product itself is worth 5 stars from an effectiveness point of view - but since it attracts bees like crazy, making it useless outside unless you're a bee farmer, I'll give it three stars.Stick with the regular product until Gunk reformulates this so you don't wind up trying to work on your car while fighting off bees. A few wasps and mud daubers came flying over too."
13693,0,Didn't Live Up,"I am one of those serious David Sedaris fans. His other books including Me Talk Pretty One Day and Naked are the type of books that make you laugh out loud on a crowded bus. After anticipating this book for weeks, it was not the constant riot I was expecting. The last chapter was great but other than that I only had one chuckle and a few smiles, which compared to other books is great but compared to other David Sedaris books is a let down. Still a fan though."
13695,0,laugh out loud and hide your eyes,"Sedaris is a funny man!! The desription of him and his stories as laugh out loud funny is right on the mark. I would have appreciated a heads up on the graphic nature of some of his tellings, though. I bought two of hese books as gifts...I felt I needed to apologize to the one recipient who received the book before I read it myself...the other one was never given...I was too embarrassed by the the raw sexual nature of several of Sedaris' musings. So be ready to laugh out loud but keep ready, ready to hide your eyes...I would strongly suggest a read through BEFORE you decide to gift this one."
13697,0,Great Listen,"Sedaris is great, as usual. I think he's also a one to two-trick pony and is ever so much more enjoyable on audio than on the printed page."
13702,0,Chuckle Moments,"I love David Sedaris for the ease at which he can have you in side splitting hysterics. The anticipation of a new collection of essays means at least an hour or two of annoying loved ones and co-workers with, ""one more section to read aloud"".However upon finishing this I only mustered up some hearty chuckles. Success hasn't spoiled Sedaris, it's just stripped him of his anonymity. Consequently placing himself in situations where he can silently observe are becoming obsolete.Most of the stories revolve around his family; a melancholic and unflattering collection of portraits that frankly I felt depressed more than amused. There are some very funny moments, but generally the absurd wit that runs through his previous essays was replaced by a sadder, softer tone. Still, fans of his work will find at least some things to giggle over, and that's more than alot of writers can say."
13705,0,Dress me disapointed,"I absolutely teared up in amusement while reading, and re-reading Sedaris' ""Me talk Pretty One Day"" and highly anticipated DYFIC&D, however it did not live up to his previous work. Worth a read, but not nearly as entertaining. But gosh-darnit do I love The Rooster!"
13714,0,Funny yet,"Sedaris's newest collection, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, is an odd mix of tales from a witty personality. The most humorous of this selection are the stories where he describes events from his youth. The main source of the hiliarity comes from his ability to create and to tell of scenarioswhich the reader can relate to their own life. He tells of picking on the youngest sibling in order to get revenge against an angry mother during a snow day. This is just one example of his tales.One major downfall of this collection is his later stories seem to drag on and carry no true point. They lack the wit and character of that makes Sedaris such a loveable author. Also, some of his commentary on his own thoughts and sexuality leave the reader feeling that he may be dealing with some deep insecurities. Yet, all in all, it is a good collection of stories to keep around the house and read in small doses."
13729,0,Who Compared This To Harvest!?!,"I suppose if your mind is only capable of making a simple dichotomy, electric Neil Young and accoustic Neil Young, then this album would remind you of Harvest. Beyond that the comparisons end.This album has a psychedelic tinge that is more reminescent of his first, self titled album than it is of Harvest.Good songs throughout. Neil employs his atonal melody making to full effect, making a dark brew of meloncholy. Right when the depression threatens to overwhelm, he comes to the rescue with Far From Home, a rollicking journey complete with horn section.My only objection is the production. Neil's voice, as well as the high end of his guitar seem pushed to the back of the mix, making the album sound faux low budget. If you've complained that some of his work sounds too slick, this is his answer."
13730,0,Bluebird Flies,"""See the bluebird fly back as in a dream, dippin' & bobbin' in the sun,"" opens ""No Wonder,"" my favorite track on ""Prairie Wind."" It has Neil's thundering guitar giving the song energy and his most determined vocal on the set. When Neil Young covered ""Imagine"" on the ""America: A Tribute to Heroes"" CD that was in response to the 9/11 tragedy, it was a stately reading that I believe would have made John Lennon smile. On ""When God Made Me,"" Neil attempts his own anthem and works fairly well with a powerful sentiment. The title track and ""He Was the King,"" an Elvis tribute, both are strong songs. The only track that makes me hit the skip button is ""Falling Off the Face of the Earth."" I also really like the artwork and packaging on the booklet. While this is not Young's strongest set, it is a fairly interesting set for those who like ""Harvest"" & ""Comes A Time."" Enjoy!"
13731,0,"Average, ordinary.","This book belongs to a wider and worn out end of the century postmodern literature.The plot is full of generally known situations, such as nutrition obsessed wealthy people, often ridiculous. The characters are interesting but numerous and sometimes irrelevant to the story.I also found the book poorly balanced, the first part is nearly insignificant. The slightly humorous book has its climax towards the end.Often the narration is tasteless, a bit thick and lacks originality.However, this book is well written and succeeds to deliver a message of redemption and change."
13732,0,Emotionless,"I wanted to like this book, but I just can't recommend it. The idea of a self-absorbed stock trader being shaken out of his rutted life and finding the joy and satisfaction in helping others is certainly promising. However, I just felt that I was watching a movie that allowed me no insight into the mind or motivations of the characters. As Richard (don't call me Dick) Novak goes through his life, interacting with a movie star, a crying woman, a reclusive writer, a kidnapped woman, and various city functionaries concerning his sinkhole, we never find out how he feels about any of the odd events happening to him!When Ben, his son, enters the story, the emotions improve, but not to a satisfactory level, in my opinion. In addition, I have trouble sympathizing with a character who can simply buy what he wants to give to people, from cars to donut shops. Where's the angst in dropping down a wad of dough to console a broken heart?"
13738,0,We ordered it thinking we had a straight legged canopy,Turned out our Quick Shade is angled legged so the screen doesn't fit correctly. Good idea to check out the canopy set up before you order! We will keep it with the intention of getting a straight legged canopy.
13745,0,readable but missing period color,"I bought this book in an airport Powell's Books, so I was in a bit of a hurry. I was intrigued by the theme and the book had good shelftop reviews. I guess I need to be more aware of the line between historical fiction and popular history, since I prefer the latter muchly. Being a student of language and language use, I was especially disappointed by the dialog and even the internal thoughts of the characters in this book. I still read it rapidly for the narrative line, but I kept feeling I was getting the Disney version of the story. As a student of literature (albeit 18th century) I would have thought Philippa Gregory would be more attentive to style than she was. Some people will love this book, but if you require at least a semblance of authenticity, it isn't for you."
13748,0,Not bad for what it is,"If you are looking for a light diverting read, this is it. If you are looking for historical fact about the lives of the Boleyns, this is most assuredly NOT it.It's not history, nor is it great literature, but I don't really think it's meant to be either. I recommend it only if you understand what you're getting yourself into; otherwise, you will be bitterly disappointed."
13750,0,Good But Too Long,"I read some but, mostly listened to this novel on CD.The narrator was excellent. The problem with listening to a CD is that you can't skim and skip parts . The story went on and on. Despite this, the story is interesting and the characters are well drawn. Th only person I liked was Catherine of Aragon. Both Boleyn girls were treated by their family like whores however; I still didn't like them .Henry the VIIIcame across as a philandererer. I liked the story and learned a great deal about the Boleyn family .Phippa Gregory reminded me of Jean Plaidy who wrote historical novels thirty years ago."

13761,0,Fun Read,"So, with the Tudors on DVD and the newest Elizabeth movie out, I'm looking for an Elizabeth meets Mean Girls movie when this one comes out. The book was entertaining, told from the point of view of Mary, Anne Boleyn's shallow and clueless sister, and details the rise and fall of her family's place at Court. Both Mary's dalliance with the King and the snare of the King by her sister Anne, and Anne's fall are the setting of this fluffy romance novel."

13777,0,Not bad for the price,"As with the other reviewer, I figured, hey, for 10 bucks, I'll give it a shot. The cut of the shirt is stylish and I was generally pleased by the look. The fabric is thin. You will be able to see a t-shirt (white) outline through the material. I wasn't pleased by this but at least it's lightweight...should give the shirt some extra longevity into the hotter months. Another issue I had is that the cut of the shirt is not good for an athletic build. I'm fairly muscular (typically 17 1/2 neck, 36"" arm, broad chest) and I found the shirt to be tight across the back and as a result, the sleeves pull back too far when arms are stretched forward. This will be a problem for people with a big chest or perhaps big belly. Overall, if you have a standard build, I would be happy with this shirt and not hesitate to wear it in a business environment. Given the price, it's a good deal."

With the bare naked boppy you can find alot of slipcovers to go with your child's room and different stores carry different styles and is so much easier to wash than the whole pillow. I have found different slipcovers at Target, Babiesrus, Target and Baby Depot."
13792,0,OK pillow,"I got this pillow to help me position my baby while breast feeding. Well, I'm pretty short, 5'2"", and it positioned my baby way to high to feed comfortably. I guess it would work better for taller people. We got the most use out of it during tummy time. My son hated to be on his tummy, but when we used this pillow, he was able to handle it much longer. We would also use it to prop him up when playing with his airtivity gym. Now he's 5 months old, and we've been using it sometimes to practice sitting. It works OK, but my son has some trouble reaching for his toys because it is snug around his waist. He is a big baby, and is growing out of it way too fast. So, we never were able to use it for its intended use, but I guess it came in handy sometimes. Still, I don't think it's a necessary item unless you are tall with a small baby."
13796,0,nice looking film,"its a good film but some parts make it downfall and then it picks up the pace with beautiful acting.

13817,0,It was a pretty good book.,"My favorite character was Piggy, a big kid who was really nice and a big heart and Ralph who was the leader but was having problems with some of the kids on the island. I didn't like Jack who was the leader of the chorus. He was cold, haunted and rude. He was the one who killed two of the other characters in the story. Then there was Simon. He was a hard worker but was too young to be leader, even though he would have made a better leader than any of the others. This story did not seem realistic to me because it's not likely that kids would actually survive on an island. I would recommend this story to kids who like action packed novels."

Okay, it's well written in a sense that it has good language use, and lots of symbols (I seemed to like it more after we talked about it in class for English), but when I was reading it on my own over the summer, I thought it was EXTREMELY boring, and I could not concentrate and would have to read chapters again and again because it was one of those books that your eyes are reading but your brain isn't absorbing. It only got interesting until (sorry to spoil it), but when people start killing each other, and that was about chapter 10 (out of 12).THIS BOOK was rather DULL but if you like symbols and such then read it for the sake of that, but NOT for ENTERTAINMENT purposes."
13840,0,Has not aged well,"Better than the last book I read but a bit too innocent for it to speak to us today. It didn't age well. I think we need far more to shock us today and so much of the significance is lost. A great book, in its time and context, no doubt."

Then the story takes a turn by showing how human behavior creates anger, jealousy and hunger for control. The key of the book is how do people react when left to survive without controls, governments aka survival in nature.The writing style is smart, vivid and exceptionally detailed. The author describes every movement, colour, geography and person in detail.The plan is simple- put kids from various backgrounds in order to get a bag full of characters possible.Read this to realise how we end up behaving when there is no control and the dark side our human mind is capable off"
13850,0,lord of the flies,"I think that the aothor's purpose was to tell,thtat everyone has some evil in them.I don't agree with the author's message,because Piggy was nothing but good.The literary elemnt that the author handled the best was symbolism.I think that because he used the conch,to symbolize rulership,and he used the pig's head,to symbolize death and evil.I think this book is believable.I think it's believable,because if some boy's stay on a island by themselves,you know there's going to be trouble.The way I think the book was ""less than perfect"",was when the boy's got rescued.If I was the author I would fix these flaws by,making the rescue more exciting."
13856,0,Lord Of The Flies,"Golding's purpose for writing Lord Of The Flies was to show mankind at its worst and how human nature can go wrong. Golding's message was that there is evil inside of us all. Golding is correct in this manner but I thing that everyone has good in them, too. In Golding's Lord of the Flies he handled the characters the best. The characters were all well developed and each one represented a different aspect of human nature: Ralph was leadership, Piggy was intelligence , Simon was spirituality , Jack was dictatorship , Roger was evil and Samneric represented the fact that everyone needs someone to help them function. Lord of the Flies was a little unbelievable in the plot aspect of the book. Twelve year olds wouldn't believe in democracy. Also the whole island seemed kind of unreal and fake like it was just a backdrop. I think the plot was less than perfect and could have been developed a little more. All in all, I would give this book 3 stars."
13857,0,"Expresses the realities of war, island is microcosm of war","This book shows people what happens when you face the realities of war. Fear,hope, and courage are all spliced into one which is something that you don't often see in one book. This book shows people how children's fears lead them to fighting. The more they fight the farther and farther they feel from home."
13863,0,Lord of the Flies,"In this book a bunch of English boy's plane crashes leaving them on a deserted island with no adults, just eachother. They split into two groups. But there is one boy named Piggy who trys to keep the group together and is basically the only boy who trys to help everyone. To find out what happens to them in the end read this lovely book."
13866,0,It was an o.k book and very well written.,The book is really not my style but i can not think of any other way to change it to make it any better. I think the author's purpose of writing this book is to show how sometimes humans can be dark and ruthless and how one can have so much influence on another. I agree with the author because it is true in our every day world.
13867,0,IT WAS OK.,I think that the Lord of the Flies was a pretty good book. It had a boring begining but the ending was full of action and conflict that kept you glued to the pages. The characters were pretty realistic and related to the people of today.
13868,0,not that good,all most everyone says that this is one of the best books ever written.i disagree completely.the book is about a group of young kids who are stranded on an island after the plane they are on crashes.the kids survive by making their own rules and selecting a leader among themselves.the boys want to be the leader and they soon become enemies.its not that great like a lot of people claim.thats my opinion.
13874,0,"a great, informative read -- but again, oy, that ending!","This book definitely does live up to a great deal of its hype - it is moving, funny, very human and certainly gave me a real insight into the lives and tragedies of `ordinary' civilians during the Second World War. But ... did anyone else have trouble with his women characters? I know a lot of people were displeased with the ending (me too; I think Corelli should have come back sooner or not at all -- as someone says earlier, the last 80 pages are fairly dire -- but even early on in the book, the way Pelagia dumps Mandras because he comes back all skanky - are we supposed to be on her side? And isn't it a disappointment that after Pelagia raises `her' Antonia to be such a free thinking independent woman she winds up some bourgeouis, seemingly empty-headed trophy wife? I had a REALLY hard time with the women in this book, I'm afraid. Still, it feels like nit-picking when, honestly, overall, I'd recommend it very highly."

13903,0,Meat Loaf with Extra Gravy,"On the whole an entertaining read but Leaming's gossip-column style and unabashed idolatry grate before long. Leaming saves her best prose not for Welles' legendary charm or artistic genius, but for his various appendages. ""The only way to make the plane was to hitchhike,"" Leaming writes, ""but when Orson extended the long tapered thumb of his extraordinarily beautiful hand, the only vehicle to stop was a garbage truck, into which Welles and company promptly crowded."" Such flourishes, as well as the index, which is surprisingly clever--under Welles, (George) Orson there is an entry entitled ""false noses used by 350, 353, 401, 424"" are the gravy on this meat loaf of a book. Eat up!"
13908,0,Not as comfortable as Spenser,"Parker's new detective, Sonny Randall, is a Boston Private Eye of the female persuasion. Her cryptic responses and abrasive manner do not amuse as would the same comments from Spenser or Hawk. Cohorts Spike and Richie are great new characters, but Sonny's enchantment with the adolescent runaway is unfathomable. The flattened affect and apathy generated by this juvenile would alienate a lesser being. Parental abuses and undoing are too contrived.. All in all, this is not as comfortable a read as Parker's customary endeavors. Furthermore, Rosie is no Pearl the Wonder Dog."

13913,0,"Good Book, but it made me miss Spenser","Family honor was a good book. Robert Parker is one of my favorite authors, so I dug right into this book. About halfway through, I thought that I was reading Early Autumn, especiallly when I got to the ""Push-up"" scene. But it is fast read, and I enjoyed it. I only wish he had written a Spenser novel instead. The thought of Tony Marcus without Hawk there to heckle him, or the serious need for Millicent to see Susan made me quite wistful for good ol' Spenser."

13929,0,"Not a Whole Lot to Listen to Here, Folks","This compilation of themes from BBC television programs isn't exactly what I'd call a shining light, to mix senses if not metaphors, unless perhaps you occasionally get nostalgic for such shows as Eastenders, Whicker's World, Star Cops and the like. Some themes are rather second rate pop-like works, while others are somewhat experimental and not that successful, in my view. The best is a prolonged rendition of the principal theme from the Miss Marple dramatizations of the 1980s: A sprightly overture with Baroque inclinations that is the delight of the album. Still, if you're looking to have it and the themes to Dallas, Knots Landing, Dr. Who and Fawlty Towers all on one disc, here they are. Otherwise, I'd give this pretty much a pass."

13948,0,Not the best season,"Season's 1, 2, and definitely 3 were quite a bit better than the season 4 of Weeds.

This show isn't trying to glamorize the drug industry anymore... at least not in this season."
13953,0,Disappointing considering how much space the DVD gave them.,"My review in on par with most of the ones written below. If you're an avid NFL fan like me, DVDs like this will attract your eye, but wait for the documentary on HBO or another channel.The documentary has a few extras included such as extended interviews, different audio segments of the same play, etc.. but there was so MUCH MORE that NFL Films could have included on a DVD capable of holding this much memory. I viewed the extras that are watchable with a computer DVD player... Nothing impressive, a collection of stats that you could get on any internet site...Not worth it until the price drops... If you're an NFL fan, you'll enjoy what you watch, but it's over quick!"
13956,0,enjoyable read,"The Abduction of Julia is light and humorous, with likeable characters. Julia's been in love with Alec for as long as she can remember so when he kidnaps her by mistake, meaning to elope with her cousin, she's not too unhappy! Alec isn't too unhappy, either, because he's marrying to gain an inheritance. A familiar plot, but it's entertainingly handled. I usually like a bit more adventure mixed in with my romances, but I'll be looking out for more books by the same author."
13957,0,Very middle of the road...,"Maybe I'm just feeling impatient today. I tossed aside several books before I settled on this one and I really can't focus on it so I keep putting it down to do something else. I've read about a third of it and I reckon that's enough. I just feel like I've read it before. Not literally, but more figuratively. There's nothing special about the story. The characters are all suitably likeable, although the heroine is of the sickly sweet do-gooder variety that makes you want to throw up with her overwhelming concern for others. The villians are also suitablly villanous with their evil machinations. It seems an okay story, but there are so much better ones out there."
13960,0,Washable blue ink,"This ink is the same as Pelikan 4001 Blue or Royal Blue. It is washable, so parents can give it to children without worrying. It can also be chemically erased/eradicated by eradicators like the Pelikan Super Pirat, which is convenient for students. Like most blue inks for fountain pens, this one dries to a lighter hue than most ballpoint and rollerball/gel blue inks. This ink is not safe for writing checks. Many fountain pen enthusiasts love this ink. I think it's OK; it's OK on bad paper, but not good enough for two-sided writing on bad paper. There are better blue inks for fountain pens."

The film The Thirteenth Warrior (Antonio Banderas) is a closer telling of the tale, and a better film.The film itself stands adequately on its own merits, although it's not much more than adequate. Christopher Lambert rides around on a horse and struts around in armor, while some unknown terror stalks around the basement of a castle. The castle is surrounded by more men with armor and horses, who don't want anyone to enter or leave it, although they're only moderately successful. Eventually there's a big fight, and the good guys win..."
13998,0,"Cooks Well, But Handle Can Burn You","This is a good small fry pan with a significant flaw. The heatproof part of the handle is somewhat short, and the metal part that connects it to the pan (and DOES get hot) is somewhat long. If you have long fingers or fingers that are difficult to bend because of arthritis, as I do, it is all too easy to inadvertently touch the hot part of the handle. I used this pan for quite some time with good results, but for my next one I'm going to try the T-Fal Ultimate, which has a longer curved heatproof handle that eliminates the problem."

14009,0,Filthy and Furious,"The Sex Pistols were an incendiary band that burned out in a flash, but their impact is still felt today. Their history is presented here through interviews and archival footage, and the documentary is fittingly dirty and gritty considering its subject matter. In addition to the story, there are several almost complete songs performed live in various venues. This is a must watch for fans, as well as anyone else interested in one of the most influential and infamous bands of the punk movement."
14011,0,Not Hillerman's Best,"I am a huge fan of Tony Hillerman's novels, and this one isn't up to par. It lacks the depth and evocative descriptions of Navajo belief, lore and countryside of some of his other novels. The story is rushed and spends way too much time referring to an older manhunt. Chee and Leaphorn are always a pleasure to visit, but if you're looking for Hillerman at his best, try ""Coyote Waits,"" ""People of Darkness,"" or any of the others."
14014,0,Rather juvenile,"It's not a bad book and there are some interesting twists in the plot but it's written at a pretty low level. If Hillerman had put a little more time into it, he could have spruced it up into a great book."

14021,0,A B-movie epic worth seeing.,"Director William Cameron Menzies, set designer for ""Gone with the Wind"" and the original ""Invaders from Mars"" (1953, which he also directed), keeps this modest Civil War story moving along nicely and with sufficient human-interest details. Guy Madison (TV's ""Wild Bill Hickock"") and James Craig are close friends who end up on the North and South sides, respectively, and who, not surprisingly, must fight one another in the movie's final reels, though they do so out of sight to one another. Come to think of it, we only see them together some two or three minutes at the start of this reasonably exciting B-epic that belies its budget, courtesy of Menzie's set designs, in spite of harsh early-fifties color and a less than liberal budget. Nothing profound, but this notable picture does convey some of the tragedy of friends and loved ones torn apart by the most horribly personal war in our history."

The audio version was presented with a male and female reader, which is usually wonderful. These readers, however, had unpleasant, nasal voices. It made it very hard to get into the mood, and neither had the slightest sex appeal. The male voice was especially unpleasant. I hope Ms. Krentz contracts others to read her next novel.Almost anything JAK writes is worth reading or listening to, and all her other audiobooks have been very well done.

14057,0,Great Learning Aid/But Slow,"I really enjoy this software. The illustrations are live and that is so much better than the illustrations in the books I have. But the only problem is for example: when you are using the two dictionary disc, after you request a few signs the program starts to get reallllllllll slow. You request a sign for a word and it takes forever to process and load. I bought a laptop specifically for this software so I could travel with it.I thought something was wrong with the laptop so I returned it.I have since loaded this software at work and at home and the same thing happens. You have to shut the program down and start it up again to gain the initial speed. And of course there are eight disc. You can't load but one disc at a time.If they could just fix these two things, this learning tool would be prefect."

THat being said:This book is good if you've never read anything else. It's good if you don't want to spend the $40 it takes to purchase an E-book with more practical information. It does give you some great points in attitude, appearance, and general perspective of women. But it is missing the meat.

The wheel makes a loud clicking noise that progressively gets worse. When I watch the TV while I ride on the trainer the TV slowly gets turned up until my wife comes in and asks why the TV is so loud. I rated this 3 stars because it is average which is unfortunately what I expected. I did not want to spend the money on a fluid trainer so I got the Magneto based on reviews and recommendations. I do not regret buying this and I would do it again, but I have been on cheaper trainers that are this loud as well."

14098,0,Cemetery Junction,"This is a very good film. But if you're buying it because you are a Ricky Gervais fan be aware that his presence on screen is rather limited. Set in 1970's England, in a small working class town, the dialog is sometimes difficult to understand but not overly so. I found the acting to be agreeable and at times admirable, especially from the veteran actors Emily Watson and Ralph Fiennes. The younger actors were very good as well. For me though, what made this movie stay with me was the soundtrack by Tim Atack. As the Dude would say, 'it really tied the room together.'"
14099,0,Been done before and better,"I watched this because of the names Gervais and Merchant and while it wasn't a bad movie, it's hard to recommend as there's not really anything in it that you haven't seen done before elsewhere and better. It feels like the co-writers/co-directors really wanted to show that they could break out from comedy and make a coming-of-age story with dramatic resonance, but what they came up with feels like a semi-serviceable imitation of other, better movies. It might have been heartfelt, but as what we're accustomed to seeing from them is exceptional, seeing something that is little more than ""fine"" compounds the letdown. Three stars because Ralph Fiennes and Matthew Goode are really great in it."

They said that when one of their people dies it closes the door and they must find an entiarly different way home. While that certainly did happen it didn't have that big of an effect,they fixed it in three pages. And the death wasn't all that big of a deal. I think they did not spend nearly enough time on the finding the way back through a portal.And the summary also made it sound like Faith and Spike had alot to do with the plot while they didn't really at all. Some parts and caracters(a.i Kate) could have been completely eliminated. So while it was good, because all Buffy books are in my opinion, it was definently a little dissapointing."

Unfortunately, the romantic side story and the use of the English language by the Japanese participants, turn this movie into another war-romance feature. A lot of stock footages from Tora Tora Tora were used (shades of the B westerns!). As to how Universal got access to these from Twentieth-Fox puzzles me. The use of actual battle color footages is distracting as the grainy quality and the different camera angles are obviously out of whack with the cinematographic structure of the presentation. Editing out the romantic side story would make this more palatable historically. That would make the film tighter as, as is, the film is already long winded."

I was hoping to see scramble city with japanese dialouge with english subtitles and all you get are stupid fan boys saying why didn't that episode air over here in the states and other stuff i really dont give a damn about. also the commercials are terrible quality and for some strange reason they keep blurring the kids faces. the promotional trailer didnt have to have commentary either.is this a Real sony DVD or a bogus fan boy version. The deleted footage were just crappy 3 or 4 second clips. Not worth the buy you'd be better off with the Rhino Version.
14224,0,Currently not functional,"Overall a near solidly made product, but the unit I received appears to have been opened atleast once in it's lifetime. Currently leaning against the wall as a black retainer cap for one of the 'U' swing pin is missing (hence my thoughts about this package being opened and possibly used at least once may be a valid concern) and yes... I checked the package VERY thoroughly.Contacting Amazon LLC for either replacement part, or return for a new one.Let me make it very clear, the product is good (once the missing part is in place), its just Amazon who is less than stellar on this purchase. I'll toss in another star once it is on the ground and being used instead of folded up and collecting dust."
14227,0,USED MEN OF MEN PURCHASE,BOOK WAS IN ACCEPTABLE SHAPE. COVER O.K. PAGES O.K. BUT QUITE MUSTY SMELLING. IT HAD TO BE IN A BASEMENT FOR QUITE ALONG TIME. I BOUGHT THIS USED SO I AM O.K. WITH PURCHASE. I GOT IT FAST.
14231,0,Father and son.,Frequency starring Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel is a sweet film of a father and son who have been separated but may get a chance to reunite through the help of a two-way radio. The film is kind of soapy in parts but I a lot of reviewers seem to enjoy this tender film. Check it out sometime!
14232,0,the time travel by roller coaster,"Enjoy ""Frequency"" as it is! You may be confused seeing at the frequent hapnnings across time, which were changed by Little Chief, John. He did it for the sake of saving his parents' lives. Wouldn't be fantastic to share time and feeling with loved one? John could do it. As the result, his whole life was completely different from his previous life. So, what does this mean to him? Where has his former life gone? ...Don't worry! This movie is more meaningful than a such reasonable question. ""Frequency"" is a thrilling, touching, and persuadable family movie. You might want to play baseball with your son."
14235,0,The Great Letdown,"The film is mysterious and colorful and I think thats its biggest strength. But you don't get a good handle on Sun Ra's own space philosophy other than ""black people must free themselves"". Overlong with good performances, but not enough musical performances. It finishes with the classic 70s ambiguous ending. In truth, not a very good music film or blaxploitation film or weirdo-art film. It has genius moments you would find in all three, but only remains infamous due to it being a weird mix of the great ingrediants."
14245,0,Eh...,"When I saw this book, I said ""Hey, that's a big book."" That's the main reason it was worth the $... It was a bit better than most of her books. She still seems to be talking to teens, despite her saying it was for both beginners and the experienced. She also continues to make the same mistake of using the words witch and Wiccan interchangably. Still, she did her research on this one, so it isn't too bad."
14248,0,Not bad for the price.,"I thought this game would be better made; mostly consists of very small cardboard pieces. But it's OK for the low price. Played it several times on Christmas and is good that it is a cooperative game, especially for the younger kids who get easily discouraged with games that are competitive."
14255,0,Good DVD,"The index for the DVD is a little confusing; sometimes I just want to pop in a DVD and go. However, the lessons are vigorous and relaxing at the same time. I found it a little tough as a beginner, but but then maybe I just didn't find the right lessons :-)"
14257,0,lots of fluff with a little meat,"I'm intriged by anyone who tells the truth these days,however painful.I didn't realize he stuttered so much though.He only says one cuss word,but he says it constantly.he was mildly funny,but he never seems to get really rolling.I'm not too impressed with this album,but I might buy his others if they are any better."
14260,0,Standard Lewis Black fare,"If you've listened to any of his previous records or heard him on the daily show, you'll have heard most of this before. This isn't saying that it isn't funny. It's just been rehashed a few too many times"
14261,0,the Lazarus Pit,I really was not into this book. It was the wrong author not the James Patterson the Mystery writer. My mistake.
14270,0,Bad singing,The music in this cd is great some of it amazing but I hated the singing. It sounds to much like N'Sync. So without the singing its great sounds alot like dream theater. so u like dream theater get this cd
14273,0,The kids aren't all right,"'Kids' is perhaps one of the most unsettling films ever made. It's disgusting and crude but compelling and relevant. I only watched the film one time when I was sixteen, and it literally scared me, and I'm not sure if I can ever do it again, which just means it works. The story follows a clan of NYC youths through 24 hours of hell that is their adolescent lives. Crisp, stylish camera work makes it feel like a documentary. We learn a young women is one of many that is infected with AIDS. She turns to being innocent and partying with friends to forget her troubles. The film ends in a disturbing manner and shows the results of ignorance to the reality of our world. Hopefully this film can stand as a example of what not to do. It hurts to watch but I recommend it. 'Kids' is a brutal but very effective film."
14274,0,"Modern-day, co-ed ""Lord of the Flies.""","And William Golding thought adults had to be -physically- absent for juvenile behavior to get this bad! How quaint...As a Gen-Xer, I think too many parents put the pursuit of money ahead of actually spending time with their children, being involved in their lives, and doing the grunt work of raising them. ""Kids"" shows the consequences of this cultural shift which began in the highly overrated 1960s. Thanks a lot, hippies! I've been to countries where parenting and family is more valued, and the vast majority of teens live fuller lives because the extended family acts as a built-in support network for them. Compare that to the hollow cheap-thrill seeking of the teens in this movie and I have to admit that family values really do make a difference."
14275,0,An Artist documents America The Doomed,"KidsSexDope. . .repeatKidsLiesTheft. . .repeatKidsRapeBrutality. . .repeatThis is today's American youth? We're doomed; this is moral implosion.My generation, and we weren't particularly thoughtful or polite, used words such as: peace, please, love, thank-you, welcome. . .I don't think I heard any or those words here. (Sorry, ""love"" is used in the film, but only as a personal lubricant.)These KIDS are subhuman. They beat; they rob; one--and this is his goal?--tries to claim two virgins in one day.Quit moralizing, you might say; this is only a movie and these are only actors. But--really--this is a documentary. In the ending credits, Clark claims credit for ""original story"". But there is no story here; it's just kids let loose. (Sorry: 21st-century American kids let loose.)About as depressing a movie as I have ever seen."
14282,0,good and bad,"this movie touches you on so many different levels its amazing. As far as the movie itself,the director,larry clark does a great job.He gives us an intense and crazy look at a day in the life of a teen. The problem with this movie is that not all teens are like the ones depicted in this film.These ones isolate themselves in a world of robbery,sex,drugs,and parties,that by halfway through the movie your nauseated. I myself am 15 years old. I do no some kids like these but not all kids are like this. At the end of the film he leaves you with the sense that theres no hope. Like everything is going to hell and theres not a thing we can do about it. It is extremely depressing and intense. The movie is frank and to the point. It is a very depressing film,but good nonetheless."
14287,0,"A little too, ""in your face"" for me.","I like the reality part of this film; I think they tried to put it in your face a little too much. I'd rent it, maybe show it to my out of control teen, and show them what might happen if they didn't have any responsibility or rules. Make sure you tell them ahead of time you don't approve of, nor support the behavior that takes place. Be quick to point out they could be on the other side of those kids at anytime. Anyhow, rent it watch it."
14290,0,Just buy the song you like,"I bought this whole album for one song, ""Thunder"", and ended up only really liking one other song on the album. I think it's more for the teen persuasion."
14292,0,ewwww.,what the all american rejects.i swear ive heard this before.ill give them credit.they actually tried and actually got a record label.which is pretty hard.so kudos to that.but they sound almost the same to all american rejects.i know they arent cause the two singers dont look a thing alike.but they sound exactly the same.but yeah.i would buy it if i was desperate.but yeah.go out and buy it if you really want.its not my first pick though.
14294,0,HOT and Slow...,"Some great scenes of Kari and 2 other women, but the plot is a bit plodding and the story line is hard to understand. If you are looking for skin, this film has 2 decent scenes, but nothing else to recommend it."
14298,0,Good Title But......,I love the concept of the book however the language is very lofty for the lay person. It is written in text book language.
14300,0,pete waye and the SCHENK,"To those of us that are older then most,we remember the first music by the master(lonesome crow) the man made his place in rock history, it is very SAD that he is not the god of rock in the U.S as he is in other countries! the U.S fans all though hardcore are little in numbers,us fans that have been there though all the rebirths of michiel will aways love him no matter where he wanders or how many guitars he sells.WE STILL LOVES YOU MICHAEL AND ALWAYS WILL!!!!!!!!!!the true fans of the bay area!!!!!"
14307,0,Slow going but worth the read,"Had this story been written in a more contemporary style, my review would have been totally favorable. I found the story to be quite sweet, with great characters and a wholesome storyline.Unfortunately, this particular style of writing for me, as a fourteen year old, was a tad daunting. I found it slow, with way too many words and descriptions. I found myself often wishing she would just get to the point.I would have awarded more stars if it wasn't so difficult for me to get through."
14313,0,"Good for display, not for fighting","I am overall content with this purchase. cheap and quick shipping, it seemed like a great idea. Only tofind out if you smack these together at all they will break quickly. within 2 swings the bottom of the handle had already cracked in half, and the last time i used it, the sword actually broke in half and almost hit me in the face! I did not expect that.So great for hanging or for light messing around, but dont plan on even moderately messing around with these"
14315,0,Cute,"This is one of our favorite Teletubbies videos! You won't be able to get ""Wake Up Wake Up"" out of your head. It's an adorable segment where children wake up their drowsy caregiver. Another memorable number has a live swing band singing ""Hey Diddle Diddle"" out in the field while children dance around. Your little ones will love it!"
14318,0,Orwell wouldnt of liked it,"George Orwell would not of like watching his book Animal Farm, in this cartoon adaptation, there is no political parrallel, nor deeper meaning, but a bunch of cartoon figures running around, it show's how authors like Sam Bald, and George Orwell, made their language put images in your head, anyway stick to the book"
14325,0,excellent,"i love this book i just think erin hunterbit off more than she can chew what with the new series of dog books, and the bear books,AND the warrior series in the end of the warrior series too much fighting and there wasnt as many details its as if erins too rushed to think about imagery"
14326,0,Good Series,"I love this series, but mostly because it's about cats. I would have liked it to be written better, but I do not expect it from a childrens book.The only real problem I had with this series is the typo's and the grammar errors. I feel that a published book should have NO typo's or grammar errors! They are distracting and unprofessional.Besides that, I found the series quite enjoyable."
14336,0,Queer life in the times of Iron Lady,"To be different, to stand out of the crowd, these are the longings that sometimesfrighten us and sometimes gives us courage. But to be declared homosexual who lives in MP's house of Tory party member, can be more than that. IT can be sad, cheerfull, dangerous, wondrous, but however you turn it, it'll always be, not so simple, deviation.And this is the book. With much influence of Kundera and Huxley, with beautiful insights in kusic, paintings and philosophy of art. Marvelous melodies of many voices flow trough all five hundred pages of the book.But, there are moments in which author overdid himself, moments that are quite pretentious, often tedious dialogues and dull dramatization. And becouse of those, this work of art with a wondrous premise somhow fails to capture one's hearth..."
14338,0,Interesting Book,"In this Henry Huggin's book, Henry is trying to get a bike. So, he tries to save his money up to buy one. Also, Ribsy gets into lots of trouble. Some of the parts are very funny. I would reccommend the book to anyone 8 and up."

14360,0,Kids Favorite Songs 2,"I purchased this video because my 5 mos. old daughter absolutely loves Elmo and laughs and smiles when she sees his face, so we were a bit dissapointed that he wasn't in every frame. She doesn't seem that interested in the other characters yet. Great songs but we wanted more Elmo.We really enjoyed Best of Elmo since it's all about him."
14369,0,Alright,"I'm 14 years old and I am halfway through the book. I took people's advice and am taking it one chapter at a time, and then discussing it with a friend of mine. I'm not really into books, but I love to push myself. After every chapter I need to research a little, and look words up in the dictionary. I would recommend this book to a dedicated reader who is prepared to work hard and use their head constantly."
14374,0,There should be a law...,"....against making different printings of the same book with different page numbers. In this book, they solve the problem by having page numbers from the first edition in the margins across from that page's original bottom line. Still, there are several editions of this book (and countless other books) where the pagination does not match up. This can be terribly annoying if you are in an English / literature class and everyone has a different edition of the book. Someone says ""turn to page 37"", and every page 37 is different. I think when the book publishers want to issue a new edition, they should copy the pages from an old edition using the photo-offset process. This is my personal pet peeve and probably has nothing at all to do with the actual novel by Joyce, but I can't really speak on that issue because I haven't read the book yet. When I do, I will update this ""non""-review and make it more informative."
14387,0,I Did It!,"There is no reason in the world for me to write a review for this except to say ""I READ IT"". I live in the boonies of SE Oklahoma where there's not a soul who has heard of Joyce much less care whether anyone has read him or not. So, reader of Amazon's reviews, you're my (un)lucky audience. Not only did I read it, but I have not moved it to my ""Trade"" shelf. I want it as a reminder of how damned goofy I can be.If you are reading this because you are wondering whether to read it or not, then the answer is that you probably won't ""get it"" any more than I did. If you do read it and actually enjoy it, then you can consider yourself goofier than me.Seriously: 1. I didn't particularly like it. 2. I AM glad I read it. 3. If I ever pick it up to read it again, shoot me."
14388,0,CD only,"Do not buy this CD to listen to in the car! The selections and interpretation of this abridged audio edition are unimpeachchable. However the reader, gifted with a clear and expressive voice, presents most of the narration sotto voce, which is inaudible on the road even at top volume."
14390,0,Case cheap and broken,We had to return this item. Case was broken at one of the hinges. The inside of the case was cheaply made and over to far to one side.
14394,0,All In!,Chips are great quality. Dice and buttons are nice too. Quality of case has a little to be desired. Worth a buy for playing poker with friends.
14396,0,Purcell is not an artist,"The only worthwhile part of this book, is when Purcell intrerviews people who Flash for as a job, and questions them on techniques, tips, and tricks. These pages are very helpful (especially sound). You can tell Purcell himself is no an artist. If you check out the tutorials he wrote, they're just so stupid, and not useful (fighting skunks, a walking ostrich, etc.). However, the CD is great, and hearing pros talk about Flash is something new, it's a worth a buy, but don't bother with the tutorials, they're a waste of time."
14397,0,deceptive advertizing,"I had to purchase this book twice (did not want to) both books were listed in the Kindle store as ""The Greatest Generation""but one of them was in fact, ""The Greatest Generation Speaks: Letters and Reflections"". Just one more Kindle problem."

14403,0,The first half hour was good but than it was terrible,"The first half hour of this movie was funny and looked like this was going to be a good movie. Right After the wedding planner scene, is where this movie got bad. It didnt get bad slowly though, it got bad quickly. The first 30 min were put together poorly but were at least funny but the rest of the movie is like the director smoked a bag of weed when they made it. If they make a sequel i hope the whole thing is good and it has a btter story"
14412,0,Decent Film,"This is the most ""Average"" Le Carre movie adaptation that I have seen. Tinker, Taylor and Smiley's People set a very high bar. Russia House and The Spy Who Came in From the Cold were above average. This film is worth watching, but not in the same league."
14421,0,"Cute, predictable romantic comedy is worth a rent.","Cute, predictable, but funny movie about a bachelor (Chris O'Donnell) who wants to remain a bachelor, but knows that he should get married to Renée Zellweger. When his rich uncle gives him incentive and a deadline, hilarity ensues. This movie got a boost from the Bay Area since it was primarily filmed in SF. Anyone who hates Renée Zellweger should not see this movie, but if you could stand her in ""Jerry Maguire"", you can watch her in this movie. Three stars. Josh Bob says check it out if you have a date."
14425,0,More Like A Soundtrack But Enjoyable,"Nelson's third album is dramatic with short clip from TV programs aptly used. The story is themed with TV dominance with human mind but it sounds like a beginning of an epic. Is it going to be like Phantom Menace or Evangelion series?In music side if you have ever heard of any Nelson albums you will notice that it is not so much of their regular style. Its tone became a bit darker and heavier. Songwriting is not as fabulous as Nelson masterpieces such as After The Rain, Life and Silence Is Broken. Yet Nelson style music can be found as in ""Sooner Or Later"" or ""Tell Me"". And ""Action""(Sweet classic known by Def Leppard cover) in the mid part starting like Peter Schilling's Major Tom shows a climax of this album very dramatic and Broadway musical like. Overall it is enjoyable.The script for a movie or TV drama based on this soundtrack would give this album more spotlight. For music fans first to Nelson try either After The Rain, Silence Is Broken or Life first."
14429,0,pretty good,"Charlie was a top-flight federal agent. Then a mob sting went wrong, leaving one of his cooeagues dead. Now, Charlies in therapy, looking forward to retirement. But there's one assignment left, and he's the only one who can tackle it."
14441,0,Unfortunately Edited,"The DVD release of the classic comedy film has restored many scenes missing from both TV showings and the original VHS release, though at the unprecedented cost of random pieces throughout the movie. While several jokes will be new to those seeing the DVD for the first time (many sexual and drug related), fans of the other formats of the movie will no doubt be scratching their heads as scenes go by without memorable bits.With the trend of jamming every possible thing onto a DVD release, it's baffling that this movie would be released with scenes missing from it. That and the conspicuous lack of special features tarnishes a true great among comedy movies.Disappointing."
14446,0,Another lens through which to view late capitalism,"We have seen and heard these scenarios before, whether couched in historical, sociological, ethical, or religious terms. This particular version of the story is well-researched and there is no particular problem with the thesis. That being said, using the term ""epidemic"" implies -- just as it does with the so-called ""obesity epidemic"" -- that the problem will circulate through the system and then go away. Framing it that way is too optimistic, for the roots run much deeper than the epidemic metaphor suggests. Worth the facts, but create your own schema if you want it to serve as the basis for action."
14448,0,"Not a ""how-to""","When I bought this book, I was hoping it was a little more ""hands-on"" than it is. It seems more like an Erma Bombeck book than an instruction manual. There are ideas for things to do like outings and stuff, but I wanted more ideas for ways to enjoy your own backyard, almost like a summer camp. This book was more concerned with making life livable for the stay-at-home parent stuck with the kids for the summer. At this stage in my life, I wanted the ""Funfilled Activities for All"" to include me. The whole point of the book seemed to be to make it through the summer and then send the kids back to school, only to wait for the next summer. Not much help."
14468,0,Not as good as the original,I think it was a worthy sequel bt i thought that it was gonna have better acting lke the 1st. The scenes were pretty sorry and the Rocks acting made me vomit firguitivly speaking.
14471,0,"Not as good, but still fun","This movie has more of everything that made the first one popular. More bullets! More CGI! More implausible situations! More wisecracks! More scantily-clad females!Unfortunately, I was actually less impressed with this one than the first one. The characters are still charming (especially the couple of Fraser and Weisz), and the villains are still wonderfully evil, but it seems that the special effects rule the day here. Even the Scorpion King's big scene at the end is performed entirely by a computer-generated character (it makes one wonder how much the Rock was paid for this non-appearance).However, fans of the first one should still enjoy themselves during this highly entertaining film."
14472,0,Not a Necessary Sequel,"This movie is inferior to the first entry in the series. I know it's not like that was a really serious film that should have had a complicated story continuation, but it didn't deserve to be retreaded and contradicted. It's like the filmmakers sort of went ""If people liked that, we'll just do more of the same thing,"" and didn't bother to remember what elements stuck out as good in The Mummy.On the plus side, the visual effects in this movie are even better. While there are some too-silly moments and unnecessary comic relief characters (annoying little kid and the balloon pilot), there are also really kickass action highs and development of the stars from the first movie. If you liked The Mummy at all then you should see this at least once, but unlike that movie I wouldn't call it a must-own for the action-adventure fan."
14474,0,Somewhat disappointed,"Short and sweet....it's a fast-paced adventure with plenty of somewhat cool effects but it doesn't come close to ""The Mummy""."
14480,0,Lukewarm,"I have mixed feelings about this movie, I suppose, like many people do. The plot is large-scale, there are now two bad guys to defeat, and the main character is funny and engaging.For me personally, I would rather see an action movie with more depth of emotion, less obvious special effects, and a less predictable plot. Essentially, not a comic book movie. I would count myself in the minority of Americans, however. Movies such as Three Kings, Memento, and Gladiator are more up my alley.If you enjoy huge armies going into battle, lots of special effects, and The Rock, check this one out. You'll dig it."
14490,0,THE MUMMY RETURNS,"What a shame for all Americans that they cannot broaden their minds to some kind of escapism for a change. Not everything needs to be black and white. Truthfully, the sequel is not as good as the original, but when you fancy sitting down and watching something other than the news, why not watch a tongue-in-cheek film, with spiffing good yarns and stiff upper lips. So to all the Americans slating this film, loosen up or your as dead as the mummies in the film."

14497,0,I Prefer The TV Show,"Good as action goes, lame as story goes. Acting was solid and the effects were good for DVD but the story was messy and I was pining for the intelligence of the TV series."
14499,0,Was better in the 90's,"This is one of those things that's better left for the 90's. Especially when watched on an HDTV, you can see some of the makeup and some of the ""acting"". If you haven't seen this, you might enjoy it. But if you remember seeing it and it was awesome (in the 90s) you might be better off leaving it at that and just enjoying the memory -- and then go watch Thor or something else if you're in the mood for action."
14505,0,Different in Sound,The sound effects and back ground music is not as clear as my 4x3 DVD version. Both versions (DVD & BD) are recorded in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound yet the DVD version plays a loader and clearer sound. The video is much better but that is because of the DVD is 4x3 in 480i and BD is 16x9 in 1080p High Definition.Mission Impossible (Special Collector's Edition)
14506,0,Not as good as I remember. BAD BLU-RAY transfer!,"I didn't buy this, and thank goodness for that! I rented the BR via Netflix for my new A/V setup, and let me tell you, this was the WORST quality transfer of a Blu-ray disc I've seen yet. I can't believe they even have this on BR. The sound was fine, but there were so many glitches, pixelation & quality of color/depth issues, I could barely enjoy the film. And I was really looking forward to a spectacular home theater experience that'd blow me away, after a long day.The film itself I hadn't seen since it originally came out in the theater. Boy, I thought I liked it better than I did. Pretty cheesy. Cruise's acting probably the best part of it all. Parts 2 & 3 are next, and I believe I liked those better. We shall see.Don't waste your money on this Blu-ray. Rent it instead."
14509,0,Hold on to your pillow!,"I'll definitely be able to admit Mission:Impossible was disappointing, but one good thing was it managed to keep me enthralled and informed the whole way through. But, alas, something is missing - this film didn't have the cleverness of The Matrix of the sexiness of The World Is Not Enough. The screenplay could of been much better, too. But, not all the film is not bad - the cinematography is good, the special effects are brilliant and the train chases and sound are good, too.If you are big on action movies with thrills and chills, I totally recommend this. For anyone else, the only advice I can give is - HOLD ON TO YOUR PILLOW, it's a wild ride!"
14537,0,"Interesting, but thankfully it's a short book","I read this book based on a recommendation from another book that ranked the top 100 business books. After completing it, I did learn a lot more about the engineering profession and I do have a lot of respect for them now. But the book did repeat it's examples a bit too much and could have been an even shorter. Again, some great examples of real life problems dealing with engineering, but I'm not sure it's worth your time to read."
14540,0,"OK, not great","I'm a huge fan of comedy. When I'm asked what my favorite thing to do is, my answer is to laugh. Life can get so frustrating and the only thing that gets me through sometimes is my ability to look at the insanity of it all and laugh about it.I still remember the first time my husband and I saw Gabriel Iglesias (a.k.a. Fluffy) on Comedy Central. His jokes about run-ins with the police made me laugh hysterically, which made my night. Plus, his laugh is infectious.When I first saw a commercial for Gabriel Iglesias: Stand-Up Revolution, I knew I had to see it. Hearing him talk about his friends all the time definitely made me eager to put a face with the name. While I didn't laugh quite as much as I do when Fluffy is on stage, his friends are pretty funny. I enjoyed this DVD and am glad to have it in my collection."
14542,0,It Dies Today is going downhill,"When i began listening to The Caitiff Choir, i realized how amazing ITD is. Sure they are pretty much typical metalcore, they have some pretty sweet riffs (Freak gasoline fight accident) and some damn good breakdowns with complitcated rhythms. I heard Sacred Heart and A constant reminder and i figured that this was gonna be a good CD, so i got it. I was very dissapointed. theyre selling out, id say even atreyu is better than them at this point. Brooks' clean vocals are very whiny and sound like they should be a pop-punk album. the guitars are still pretty cool, but the drumming isnt as good as it used to be. and the breakdowns, and there are only a few, are boring, simple breakdowns. Hopefully with the new vocals, ITD will make a comeback."
14545,0,Slow Down!,"For a beginner, the dialogues on the CD are spoken much too quickly! I would understand if they were spoken quickly one time to be able to hear how they would sound naturally. But then they need to be repeated more slowly so that a beginning student can try to follow along. Even the repetition phase of the CD (when you repeat after the native speaker) goes too fast. For intermediate french, this would work, but not for beginning."

I'm far more likely to take up a role playing or first person shooter option, but, I wanted to give this a chance and overall I found it to be entertaining but difficult to enter into any sense of progression to where I'd want to keep coming back for more.My sons, who like racing games, found the experience average and didn't compare it strongly against other games that they have played.So all I can say is that it's fun in small doses.3 stars.Bart Breen"
14553,0,Small annoyances,"I really wish that I liked this machine more than I do, since I researched it carefully and decided that ""price is not an issue."" But it does small dumb things. It's always telling me that there's a paper jam when there isn't, and opening the back is not convenient. It just switched itself from the front paper tray to the back tray, where I keep photo paper, and wasted 7 pages of photo paper before I noticed it. I switched it again to the front feed, tried to print my document, and it switched itself back. I've turned it off and perhaps it will do what I say next time.I'm also unimpressed by some of the finishing -- for example, the plastic part that moves to accommodate 4x6 photo paper in the back paper tray is flimsy and difficult to move.I've been using computers and printers for 20 years, and have owned many, so I'm not a complete bumbler. Just frustrated."

14562,0,"Have Some Faith, This is a Good Romantic Comedy","Edward Norton`s directing debut focuses the story of three long-time friends, a priest (Norton himself), a rabi (Ben Stiller) and a business woman (Jenna Elfman). This friendship will turn into a troubled romantic love triangle, questioning the power of faith, trust, friendship and love. It`s funny enough, even if not hilarious, and the characters are deeper than those of an average comedy, especially Edward Norton`s priest, quite credible and realistic. As a whole, the movie is a fine, hip and witty NY love story, avoiding the usual sapiness as it doesn`t get too romantic and lame. Of course, the ending is predictable and happy as ever, but it doesn`t seem too forced and actually makes sense. A good movie for the twentysomethings."

14587,0,Disturbing -- hence a useful introduction to existentialism,This book could be considered a bronze standard existentialist novel. You're unlikely to look at life quite the same way after reading it.
14589,0,A Vessel for Existentialism,"When I first read this novel I found that the plot of the story was less interesting, and less important than the personal philosophy of the main character, Meursault. Meursault has an indifferent approach to life, he does not believe in sustaining relationships, he indulges in the pleasures of relationships, only when it is convenient for him. One could define it as ""carpe diem"" but it seems not to be completely accurate with Meursault. Anyway, the plot should not have been the vessel for the man's personal philosophy, that is my only qualm with this book."
14591,0,Juh?,"This bizarre little novel was recently named one of the 100 best of the century. If there were (a la Ayn Rand) some philosophical speeches, perhaps this could be redeemed, but it is very difficult to find sympathy with a murderer, even one condemned for the wrong reasons."
14592,0,"An interesting idea, but Meursault deserves no sympathy...","Camus has a point to make in this book, but sometimes he makes it hard to find. True, it is unfair to judge a man because he fails to live up to societal standards and not because of the crime he commits. The fact remains, though, that Meursault DOES commit murder. That he does so for no particular reason (the sun gets in his eyes?)only makes the act more unthinkable. Shouldn't we be more afraid of a man who kills another man randomly than one who does so with some sort of motivation?Since the book is written in the first person, Camus obviously intended for this story to come across as the oft-told tale of the ordinary man caught up in a world gone mad. However, I came away from this book with the impression that Meursault was the one who was mad. Or perhaps he was simply autistic. Either way, he neither understands the system nor operates within it, and it is this failure that causes his downfall, not society."
14594,0,Not For Everyone,"If you are into post-modernist rambling, then this is the book for you. It's a classic in that genre and should be respected as such. However, if you are into interesting stories that have a plot and well-developed characters, then avoid Camus."
14599,0,A Very Good Book Help Us to Think!!!,An honest human being who is responsible for his social role and being executed for unwilling to accept any pre-defined social values that he doesn't believe. A good book for any real human beings. We are not able to and have no right to judge the moral issue in this book. But we have to think about life honestly when facing ourselves. Something exists with thoughts alone and nothing to do with any sensation or materials. This book definitely helps us to think.Those people who contempts this book have no serious thoughts about the real life and real value. It's not much difference of they never read this book.
14604,0,Very strange,"This book is very strange, since it tells a series of terrible events that change the life of a man forever. However, it is not the events that make the book, but the reactions and thoughts the different characters have.The main character, Mersault is simply intriguing... you learn about his life, his thoughts, his feelings... and yet, you know nothing at all... in my opinion, he is one of those characters that grows on you and in some instances you can even feel identified with him, but in the end he is a Stranger whom you dont understand.The plot itself is not very interesting, and it is a bit depressing, starting with a funeral and then moving on to a murder and finally a trail and life in jail... still it keeps you reading... I know, it is hard to explain, and I guess that is exactly what has made this book a classic, it is impossible to categorize, analyze or even try to make sense of it.... but it is also impossible to put it down."
14607,0,If you are doing A-Levels - I suggest you read on.......,"OK, listen all you guys. I've read this novel in french and let me tell you - it isn't all that fun. I appreciate Camus' genius in writing such a fulfilling plot - if you like that sort of thing. If you want to make reference to another novel in any of your essays or you wish to read another book that's quite similar but, if I may add, not quite as good, read Mauriac's ""Therese Desqueyroux"". It's much more complicated but still worthwhile. Anyway, back to old Camus. I used to be really interested in reading French literature until I found Camus. It's all together quite daunting now. So, if you are intending to read this book as a form of leisure, I suggest getting your hands on a translation. GOOD LUCK! Oh and by the way, if anyone could offer me a second-hand copy of any translation of l'Etranger I'd be extremely grateful. Cheers folks! HAPPY READING!!"
14609,0,great content but not easy to handle,"Having all the definitions in one book is really handy. But it ends up being a heavy one to lift, little font to read, very fine pages to grab and turn and a quite austere approach to vobulary. Illustrations are not numerous and are in black and white. I miss so much the glossy pages, color illlustration, and user friendliness of Larousse dictionaries that I used in French. It was a pleasure to learn the dictionary by heart. This was ardeous and done to address need. It is functional but lacks the fanciness that makes searching and reading fun besides useful."
14610,0,Exhaustive in 1961 - 50 years out of date.,"I bought this dictionary because my collage courses were using words which weren't in my (Webster's) collegiate dictionary - and it has been great for what I bought it for.It is not nearly up to date. It was published in 1961, and the next edition (W4) is a current project started in 2008 (according to Wikipedia). There are many words which you just won't find in it because they are new or technical. For an ""exhaustive"" dictionary, this is inexcusable. BTW: You won't find many of those missing words in the Addenda section in the front."

14621,0,Kathleen O'Neal Gear Sands in the Wind,"The book was entertaining but the story line was a little hard to follow. New facts seemed to show up willy-nilly. Normally these would add twists and turns to a story line, but in this case they confused me."
14622,0,Interesting Dilemma???,"This story is in an interesting perspective in that Conrad uses a new way of writting style that is hard for some to grasp. Others find the style a strong new challenge for readers. I consider it a strong novel with an interesting plot, but not one of the turning points of America. It's just a book."
14623,0,Mixed Feelings,"Conrad, a man who learned English as a second language, shows an immense skill and confidence with it. His style and story is very interesting throughout the first half, but as soon as Jim enters Patusan, it falls apart. Jim tries to hard to love Jewel and to be accepted by his new community. Conrad would have done better to have stopped sometime after Marlowe's original discussions with Jim. Conrad originally intended to make his idea into a short story, and that is how it should have been."
14627,0,"Decent story, but thickly written","We studied this book in a college literature class and I couldn't wait to finish it - author Joseph Conrad's thick writing made reading this book a real chore. Still, the story contains a decent plot and interesting main character. Lord Jim is an adventurous and charismatic young British sailor who survives a ship disaster in Asian waters, and finds himself blamed for the mishap. Stripped of his seaman's card, he must deal with overwhelming guilt while also seeking full or at least partial redemption. He ends up moving to the remote corners of the Malayan peninsula, where he becomes a trusted protector and helper of underdeveloped natives. Sound interesting? If you don't mind books written in a sluggish Victorian style, you'll probably enjoy LORD JIM. If you demand readability, go elsewhere."
14628,0,"Good story, book fell apart","A wonderful story. However the book binding started falling apart during the reading, and it was such a problem I took out my library's copy to finish the book. So I recommend being a bit skeptical about the described book condition when purchasing."
14631,0,Decent movie but not worth the money,"I have to start off by saying who ever cast this movie did an excellent job. Who ever wrote the script did a very poor job. The story line was no where as great as the casting was. The story line was very corny,repetitive, and many times boring. I was so glad when the movie was over. I think the movie could have been a whole lot better but it wasn't just awful. In case you are thinking about buying this movie, DON'T."
14632,0,Good beginners book,"This is a good beginners book with short sections on different topics. That's all it is thoughm a beginners book.

About of the way into the book I started wondering if there is a better Steely Dan book out there."
14651,0,Kudos to Whoever Wrote It,"I recently read an interview with Mr. Patterson wherein it was disclosed that he writes outlines for his novels, and then collaborators (which is a fancy word for anonymous authors) create the actual stories. That colored my reading of this entertaining, light novel about a woman and the advice shared by her grandmother via a series of letters.The premise is a familiar one, and there will be very few surprises. Getting there, however, is the main part of the interest. Jennifer has recently suffered a loss, and Sam is trying to help her allow herself happiness again. I won't include a bunch of spoilers here as so many others have done, but if you've read more than a couple of these sorts of novels, you'll know how it will end.I quite enjoyed the story, and look forward to reading the other novel that has been written in this vein, ""Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas."" All my best to the faceless author who put this together on the basis of Mr. Patterson's outline."

14663,0,Good remake.,"I found this movie to be pretty good, but not as gripping as the original. The special effects are better, the movie is well acted and keeps up the pace, however I tend to still like the original one better, but I cannot put my finger on why I feel so. Overall: GOOD."
14669,0,Fluff,"This extremely lightweight comedy/romance is not very interesting but the actors are likable and there are a few (mind you, A FEW) laughs along the way. The plot is very thin indeed and the whole scenario with Judd researching bovine behavior to explain the actions of men never really catches on or clicks with the audience. The movie is so predictable and boring that I kept waiting for the Ellen Barkin scenes to try and figure out what on earth she has done to herself to look completely different (never did figure this out although I'm sure a knife was involved). The film also brings another question to mind and that is why Marisa Tomei is not used more often and to better advantage?"
14673,0,Pretty much only worth watching because of Hugh Jackman,"This movie was a basic romantic comedy, very predictable. Ashley Judd and Marisa Tomei's characters are actually rather annoying at the beginning of the film, the type of women who will sleep with a man and fall head over heels supposedly in love, and then get her heart broken, and do this over and over again with men. I was annoyed with Jane and Ray beginning a relationship because he was already in a 3 year relationship with someone else ( dont act surprised when the guy turns out to be a jerk, come on!). Fortunately though both Ashley Judd and Hugh Jackman are very good looking characters and the idea that they are going to be together in the end saves it. The end was not as great as it could have been though. And thankfully, she proves her cow theory wrong.."
14677,0,It's all about the other guy,"A very cute movie, which in the first hour or so is very clever and funny; Ashley Judd has surprisingly good comic timing and Greg Kinnear is not as irritating as I have often found him to be. It stumbles a bit near the end-- too much time seems to have been spent on the set-up and not enough on the pay-off; still, it's worthwhile and women everywhere will empathise with the main character's plight.The reason to watch, though, can be summed up in six words: Hugh Jackman, Hugh Jackman, Hugh Jackman. This is the first time that many people will have seen Jackman on film, and here's hoping that it's the first of many; the man is electric in any role he takes."
14682,0,Style over substance.,"Feynman was one of the most accomplished physicists in the 2nd half of the 20th century. His publications speak for themselves. However, as represented in this set of lecture notes, I do not find him as a pedagogue more enlightening than others. I bought and read this book in grad school, and found it to be a nice quick intro to several topics (spin waves and such). I did not, and still don't find the exposition physically exceptionally profound. One difference though, is the fact that Feynman, with his fame, could afford to be rather informal in his presentation. Any unsatisfactory aspects would be accepted as the mysterious ways of a 'genius'. If you are a student and would like to learn to solve problems on your own, forget this one. What this book gives you is a little 'attitude', aside from a quick intro, which most of us haven't earned the right to put on, of doing physics. Try it. Try to be as unorthodox and informal as he was, and you will mostly end up with nonsense."
14686,0,"wonderful film, horrible video quality","Michael J. Fox at his best, which is very good indeed. I agree with the many other reviewers that the quality of the video is horrible, the worst in my collection of 400 discs. Please, we beg you, petition the studio to produce a BluRay version so richly deserved by this fine film."
14689,0,Rewatchable Story -Only a fair transfer,"The film is charming but I was always disappointed with the transfers to VHS I had seen. So when it came out in DVD, I jumped on it. Sad to say, they must have used the same copy for both transfers. It remains enjoyable. The line to listen for is when Woody is in Hollywood and is asked (off camera) ""Isn't that a movie star?"" He replies (off-camera) ""No, it's just Ted Danson."""

14698,0,Cheap Way Out,Disney took the cheap way out by releasing this movie in 4x3 full screen format instead of one of the widescreen formats that Blu Ray disks are normally released in. This is the only Blu Ray disc I have seen in 4 x 3 format. I returned the Blu Ray disc because I refuse to pay Disney's premium price for a non widescreen Blu Ray of Pinoccio. I hope Disney re releases it in widescreen because it is an excellent movie.

14708,0,One of the first,"This may be one of the few first adaptations of a Stephen King novel. Christopher Walken is a fantastic actor, but it seems something is missing in the movie. I think the director could have done a better job putting this together, seems a little disorganized and bland at times.This is another Stephen King movie that I would like to see redone again on a grander scale."
14723,0,It's fun but that's about all you can get from this film.,"Peter Hyam's should take lessons from Steven Speilberg or even James Cameron at making a entertaining film most of his films are garbage and they don't amount to anything except agood time but to expect to pay 5 to 9 dollars for his movieswhen most of them are just straight to video releases is tomuch to contemplate.If you expect to get a good telling ofthis classic then maybe you should look at some of the british productions or even Disney's 3 Musketeers good fight scenesand but no where near as good as the matrix Justin Chamberswho plays D'artaign who couldn't act his way out of a paperbag who plays the hero like a cardbord cutout is obviouslyhere as look's , Mina Suvari is given ditzy cardboard linesand Tim Roth what good actor he is wasted with a one demensional charachter who is just bent on killing but if you watch this forfun you will get that out of it."

14729,0,Mostly Recycled Material,"In general, I love the Maddoxes' work. Mary has an amazing, soothing voice and is very articulate and imaginative in her descriptions of the thoughts and feelings and ideas she guides you though. But this CD seemed to be a recycling of the 'Just Relax' CD material, sometimes verbatim. I didn't hear anything new, which was disappointing. I would have preferred to be taken on a journey. Andrew Weil has double CD set about getting to sleep and the journeys on the second CD about preparing for sleep and moving towards sleep (as if you are on a beach and walking slowly into water) are more what I was hoping for.I also would prefer a second meditation for sleep rather than a whole other track of music. Music, for some reason, keeps me awake. A soothing voice is more likely to help me relax and sleep."

I got my sets for under $8 each set which was worth the cost, but I probably wouldn't pay $20 for them, they're just okay. I wouldn't recommend using them as gifts since they do have a number of imperfections but they're nice as decorative glassware and they have a nice weight to them. I use the big martini glass for either flowers or as a big candy dish."

The section describing the ""drug trip"" was particularly tedious. I did some reading about the book and apparently this was a popular sort of scene in the time period in which Dumas was writing. I was yawning through it. While there was war, violence, and intrigue, I think a good editor ""trimming off the fat"" would have really helped Dumas's writing for most of the last 2/3 of the book."

There are so many things to love about this movie, from the dialogue (bad but campy) to the acting (acceptable) to the plot (nostalgic) to the dancing (great) to the love story (somewhat engaging) etc. etc.The DVD itself, however, is supposed to contain additional scenes and material that the avid fan of this movie could not be too excited about. Well, perhaps my expectations were too high, but I expected outtakes and interviews that just did not exist. The bios I can get anywhere, and the additional scenes I had seen before. There is nothing added to this DVD that makes it ""collectible"". The movie itself is enough!"

14800,0,Eh boring till the end.,"When I watched this movie for the first time I thought it was just another ordinary movie. Nothing really interested me; the dancing, the love story, and the couple problems did not stop me from leaving the television set to do something else. It was not till the end of the movie till I started to enjoy it. The dancing scene at the end was probably the best part. The music and the dancing just made me want to get up and dance. Overall it was an alright movie which had a great ending."

I wasn't too impressed with all the other tracks on it though. They were all kind of weak and just didn't have same quality as the single. However, the song with P Diddy wasn't too bad, just could have been done better. Also, the track ""Twork It Out"" kind of makes you want to get your freak on. In short, I wouldn't have bought this CD if his single wasn't always sold out in stores, but the song ""U Remind Me"" is tight so I guess it was worth it."

14811,0,Why not more stereo?,"Been looking forward to a ""Girl Crazy"" DVD for years, but I'm disappointed that only one number will be issued in stereo. I recorded the film off the air years ago and replaced the soundtrack of all the numbers with the stereo versions from the Rhino CD, and it's amazing! Watching this film with all the numbers in stereo is really a joy - why couldn't WB Video have done the same thing and given us the option of watching it in stereo or mono? A big missed opportunity."
14813,0,"Check it out at the library, but don't take it home.","This was a very interesting book with detailed characters and a creative new world to explore. The biggest issue that I faced with this novel was that it was very confusing. Some of the explanations for things are unfathomable; I would find myself re-reading the section multiple times and still be unable to understand it. I think it's a very unique and different new world, but Sagara sometimes puts the reader on overload with too much information to absorb or understand at once. Having said this, it was an enjoyable read, but not something that I can see myself reading over and over again. Borrow it from a friend, or check it out at the library, but don't take it home expecting to get multiple readings out of it. Just my thoughts; happy reading!!"

I didn't like that Viveca narrated the whole movie, that got on my nerves. This movie is definately worth checking out and not just a rental! This was a well acted movie. Bobbie Brown could've had a larger role I thought. If you're depressed, this will sure bring you a couple of laughs to take your mind off your worries"
14849,0,A necessary coda to a masterpiece,"After reading Dune you just want more of that universe no? It was to sci-fi literature what Star Wars was to sci-fi films. This sequel is short, has very little action, has nowhere near the scope of the first book, but was interesting to read none the less, because it expanded upon the Dune universe. We do get to see Paul's character evolve, but other than that, no other characters seem to be developed very well at all (with the exception of the ghola Idaho). Where was Jessica for example? - and Chani, Stilgar, etc. seem to be glossed over. I wish Herbert would have doubled the size of this book, and maybe then it would have seemed less like a quickie coda."
14852,0,Hugely Overrated by a Nostalgic Older Crowd,"I can see how this book was once considered great, just like Star Wars once had the best special effects and the Cubs were once a good baseball team...

Herbert takes you into his imagination which allows your mind to run wild. Many times i was lost because his world is nothing like we know the world as it is today. This book is in the future and is based upon a war over spices. In which, a man, Paul fights against the emperor. If you want to read something which allows your mind to run wild this is a book for you."
14857,0,"Very imaginative, vivid images, quite a fantastique world","This is one of those situations where I actually preferred the movie to the book. Although the book gave much more background than the movie, it was much easier to follow the book after having seen the movie. I think if I had read the book first, I would have been lost completely. The movie is also part of my permanent collection. I mean, who could resist Kyle McLachlan as the Kwizatz Had'arrach?"
14858,0,doesn't live up to the expectations,This is the book about the reign of Paul and his sister Alia. I think it lacks A LOT of Dunes dense atmosphere. A disapointment. The thoughts and thinkings of the main characters are severly reduced. The plot itself is also not nearly as intriguing as in Dune (I even have some trouble recalling it). Perhaps it would have been preferable that Dune would have remained as a finished work itself? I wouldn't have missed Dune Messiah
14860,0,Herbert's worst is still pretty good,"For some reason, this book didn't turn out so well. As a die-hard Dune fan, I read this book just twice. I re-read the whole series every year, but I skip this one and never miss it. Children of Dune gives you enough plotline information that it's not really necessary to ever open Dune Messiah. If you haven't read this one yet, skip it and just go to the incredible #3."

Presently, Herbert saw it necessary to use the word presently at least once every other page. I also find the idea of some futuristic fiefdom a little unlikely, and remained unconvinced by the end. Better than Star Wars. Not that that is any great feat. Can anyone direct me to a good stillsuit manufacturer? I am planning on moving to Arizona."

This single contains his two newest hits, ""Welcome Back"", the laid-back summer-jam that samples the ""Welcome Back Kotter"" theme to joyous effect, and ""Breathe, Stretch, Shake"", the bouncy dance joint. Both are pretty nice songs, except the new ""cleaner"" Mase can't seem to get away from some cliched lines in ""Breathe, Stretch, Shake"", an otherwise nice song. While his comeback didn't make as big of a splash as he would've liked, you can never count out Mase and the ever-changing Bad Boy roster."

As for the action and effects, most of the things going on you know for sure are not possible and fairly far fetched to believe with a heavy dependence on computer generated and blue screen effects.I sometimes wish I could be 6 years old again in mindset so I could really enjoy films like this. I remember watching Tom and Jerry and it was the greatest thing in the world because I could care less what the storyline was, i just wanted to see things blow up and get beaten to a pulp.To sum up XXX in a sentence...Its an adult cartoon with a script written just above the skill of a XXX movie writer but with a big budget for a who's hot now actor and plenty of effects to keep the whole trailer park entertained."
14927,0,Just don't compare XXX with 007 !,"I had never fallen sleep during an action scene in a movie but, there's always a first time ! These film makers simply set out to execute big action scenes and connect them with rather unmemorable dialogue (I seriously doubt if the catchphrase ""You got to be kidding me!"" will stand out in posterity !) You can't really call this a lousy movie but then again, trying to compare XXX to James Bond is like comparing Mountain Dew with Champagne."

14942,0,"Excellent overview, a bit off on target audience focus","This is an excellent book to get an overview of real options, IF you are already familiar with the valuation of financial options. Otherwise, you would find yourself disbelieving the valuation process, which is not very well covered here. You can't really blame the authors since this is not a book on option valuation.If you have already studied financial options, then you will find the parallels drawn to real assets very interesting & instructive. The argument that corporate management with real-options will, in the long run, be rewarded by investors, is intriguing & plausible, but not well supported in the book.In short, I would recommend this book to corporate managers who have studied financial options in college and for whom real options may not have come up before as a decision-making approach."

But, I guess this is the best they have to offer at this point in their career.It is amazing that this band, who, with ""Beggar's Banquet,"" ""Let It Bleed,"" ""Sticky Fingers"" and ""Exile on Main Street,"" created 4 of the best albums of all time, now puts out such middling stuff. I guess the songwriting gift dries up at some point. Just don't tell that to Bob Dylan or Tom Waits..."

I'm starting to get an audio identity crisis with these singers. Clay Davidson. Mark Wills. Craig Morgan. Wade Hayes. Tim McGraw. Kenny Chesney. Clay Walker. They all do great jobs, but sometimes there's little difference in their stylings, arrangements, and songs, that I never knew who I'm listening to. Clay needs to find some better material and capitalize on his sensitivity and stop trying to be every country singer in the world."
14994,0,Joseph is okay...BUT,"I absolutely love both the Canadian cast and the Broadway cast soundtracks, so I was excited to see this production. I wish I could say that I was excited to HAVE seen it, but it was just okay. Donny Osmond does a great job...he's the best thing in here. I know Maria Friedberg is an up and coming name in musical theatre, but I was extremely disappointed in her performance. Her voice doesn't have the strength of the leads on the cast recordings, and she mugged her way through a lot of the numbers, which would work on stage, where everything needs to be exaggerated, but doesn't work here. (To be fair, most of the cast does the same.) It was a little distracting that the singing on some of the numbers was not syncronized with the actors' lip movements. It's better than nothing though, and everytime Donny Osmond takes center stage you forget the flaws."

It would have been better if this movie only had a few scenes with songs. The songs were catchy, and I don't really like that.

If you're are Scorsese fan see ""Mean Streets"""
15042,0,What?,"First of, I'm a HUGE fan of Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", those movie never get old. I realized this was his first film but come on. The plot is basically about Harvey Kietel growing up in New York City, dealing everyday with problems: the local mob, his epileptic girlfriend, his idiot best friend, the cops, etc. A one-star is too low, and I would've given this movie two stars but I liked seeing Robert DeNiro playing a more comic roll, as opposed to other major movie roles he's had (Casino, Goodfellas, etc). In this film, he plays a punkass city kid named Johnny Boy with a loud mouth and no respect. So that was entertaining. Otherwise, a weak movie. I'm a huge fan of mafia/crime movies but it didn't do it for me. Sorry."
15043,0,DAMN ITS NOT AS GOOD AS I ASSUMED,"Taxi Driver is by far the best scorcese/deniro flick around. Cape Fear was ok and mean streets is less achieved. I sure as hell thought this film would be really really good but it left me to believe you cant win em all. I'm not saying the movie sucked, I'm just saying I expected a lot better seeing as how this was the film that started the whole scorcese/deniro revolution. Still, its a good film. see it if you love the director and deniro. Keitel is brilliant in this one."

I guess I'm not the only one who bought the book because I wanted to know ""that side of the story"" and about the people who suffered the most. I read the book and I must say that I expected more than what I got. The book is nice and will touch your heart. But as the story goes on, you start to loose interest. It becomes a sequence of events, nothing more. I agree that ""sometimes you must decide to survive"". But I think that, well, the second half of the book could have been written in a more interesting way.It is an affecting read. But if you read it, don't take too long or stop reading and think ""I'll come back to it later"". Finish the book and you'll enjoy. Put it aside and you won't!"

It was definitely worth the money; don't let my somewhat mediocre rating fool you.

Now on to the review: I had heard ""All the things she said"" on the WB now cancelled BIRDS OF PREY and i loved it. The reason why i gave the album only three stars was because its very padded. The album has some cool moments ""not gonna get us"" rocks but Tatus high pitched voices can become very annoying. SHOW ME LOVE and CLOWNS are the two best tracks very high energy, SHOW ME LOVE also comes in a great extended version. One song i dont understand is MALCHIK GAY, are they singing it to a gay man or a straight woman??? Anyway the album also has unneccesary russian versions of NOT GONNA GET US and ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID.

15102,0,A pretty good adaptation of Tolkien's masterpiece,"This animated version of Tolkien's 'The Hobbit,' along with the other two films of Bakshi's trilogy, stays pretty faithful to the book on which it was based. There are parts missing, of course, but that is to be expected with any screen adaptation. The voices are great, and the music (by Glenn Yarbrough) is tolerable, although very dated. In fact, this is one of the chief defects of the movie--the dialogue is very dated. You can only tolerate hearing Bilbo or a dwarf say ""Bless my Soul!"" so many times.Overall, though, this is a pretty good film. The animation is not great (Smaug has the face of a cat), but is tolerable for the time in which it was made. Again, there are no technological marvels here, just a good, well-told story. This movie isn't perfect, but it will do until a newer version of 'The Hobbit' comes along."
15107,0,This was a good movie,"This was a good movie, but there were a few problems. When I saw the Hobbit in DVD, I noticed that they took out most of the sound effects. why? I don't really know, and I thought if I got the VHS it would be better. but I was a little hard to see the picture because of the different colors. I'll just have to accept the DVD and deal with no sound effects. but the movie was still good anyway."
15114,0,My god! They killed Bilbo!,"I loved The Hobbit as a book, so I thought; Mabye the movie is, if not equally, then at least great. But I was dead wrong. Everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong... From the opening with the visit of the dwarves, 'till gollum, 'till the feud between Bilbo and Thorin... They didn't even get the Goblins right... and I should think drawing a goblin/orc would be a task easy enough for people that haven't even read the book... And the way they just CUT OUT large parts of the book (like the visit at Beorn's place) is just not right.

15116,0,"Very good, but with a big flaw.","This is one of my favorite movies. A great story with wonderful music. This DVD seems to have a big flaw, though. Unless there is some sort of flaw in my player, a significant portion of the soundtrack seems to be missing. All of the music and dialog is there, but a portion of the soundtrack that contains a large portion of the sound effects has been left out. Things like the Eagles screaming, rocks grinding, some of Smogg's tail crashes and screams, the sounds of the eagles/goblins/and battle at the end. Their absence makes for some uncomfortably quiet spots in dramatic moments of the movie. Someone should go back and check on the master for this one."
15119,0,"The movie is decent, but the book was lots better.","The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is one of my all time favorite books. I hope you all get a chance to read it sometime, for pleasure or for a class. This animated movie is better than what I expected from a cartoon, but it's still slightly geared toward little kids. It's a good compliment to the book, but to truly appreciate the storyline, it doesnt' cut the mustard. It leaves out some very key episodes and characters that were some of my favorite in the book. Where are Elrond and Beorn?!? It's a good movie that I've watched several times, and I would purchase the Lord of the Rings movies by the same people too if I ever find out that they were made.

This is a beautifully bound compact Bible, with excellent reference notes and a remarkably complete concordance. Small enough to fit into a typical ladies purse, it's a convenient size to take on the train or bus. But the print is extremely small and takes some getting used to. It's a shame the publisher didn't make the Bible even slightly larger; I think it would have been a runaway best seller. As it stands, I can only give it 3 stars...the print is just too small."

The only reason for using this one is to save an input on my RX-V659, which almost has too few to begin with. The audio is passed as analog from this dock. I thought (silly me) that it would pass a digital signal. A friend reminded me, though, that the RX does not decode MP3, etc., so I am not so disappointed as I was about this. The quality of the sound is not nearly so good as it is through my other (DLO) dock for the iPod. For the final blow, I am also disappointed in the the remote control. It took a little digging in the RX manual (no mention in the YDS-10's) to figure out how to control the iPod from the RX's remote. Then I find out that you cannot select a video to view from the remote. You must do this through the iPod's select wheel.If you can't tell already, order the DLO. Their best one is a few dollars more, but well worth it."
15144,0,Not quite there,"While the YDS-10 performs all audio functions as expected, and the on screen menus are a big plus, it misses with video. You still have to use the click wheel to play music videos, and pictures. I like to play a slideshow of my pictures while listening to music, and music videos are why I bought the video IPod. I have to use the the click wheel for anything concerning pictures. That's not exactly what I'd hoped for. I wanted to use the on screen menus and make selections from a distance rather than going back and forth from the TV and stereo. If you're looking for audio only, this is it. If you have a video IPod, the YDS-10 will leave you disappointed."

I did go to a CB shop after installation to have the Wilson 5000 Roof Top Mount CB Antenna tuned, but I still have less the desired performance. For the most part it serves the purpose of close range communication when stuck in traffic and wanting to know what the hold up is or which lane I need to be in.

But it's a quality unit, well-built and functions just as well as any other stock CB I've ever used."
15152,0,I have had better,They are the basic sesame stick. I have had better ones but atleast they do not contain any of those yucky ingredients that are so bad for out bodies.
15159,0,"Great series, poor quality DVD's","I really love this series but am disappointed in the DVD set. The picture quality is mediocre at best and doesn't show the great photography which made the original programs so appealing. The discs were very difficult to remove from the case, and you have to be careful not to damage them when taking them out. One of the hubs which held the DVD's in place broke off after the set was played only a few times. I wonder why a better DVD set of this series wasn't made for our region. This is not an expensive set if you can get it at a reduced price, but one wonders if it is really worth the money when other nature documentaries which are just as good have been released on better material. If you like David Attenborough and want to see one of his best documentaries featuring birds you will want to own this set, but you might be very disappointed in its quality."
15166,0,Not a bad bet,"The camera body is very good. The lense looks properly aligned as well. However, I noticed anistropic chromatic aberrations prominent esp at the edges. Thus unless your subject is right in middle of your view, you might see aberrations on sharp edges. However the product is very good and for a amateur its recommended."
15169,0,Everytime I Try to Watch This I Fall Asleep,"I've tried, folks. In all sincerity, I have made more than three noble attempts at watching this film in its entirety. Each and every time, without fail, I fall fast asleep. It not only disappoints me that the historical facts have been skewed for no justifiable reason, but it's also tiresome to watch Milla Jovovich play Joan like a heroin junkie. Several inconsistencies abound throughout, from dialects to editing. I think I finally sold this one for some gas money. It only got me around the block."
15171,0,Saint Or Sinner?,"A sweeping epic film. I was impressed by the cinematography. I was fascinated by the psychological twists and questions the film raises. The battle scenes, I must say, are not for the fainthearted. This could have been a great film. What ruined it for me was the performance by Jovovich. I found it overdone and annoying. I was greatly disappointed."
15177,0,Merely entertaining,"The movie is ente However, a movie based upon a real person'slife should be more than just entertaining; it should be instructionaland inspirational. Due to it's apparent historical errors, it is neither educational nor inspiring. It's just another dazzling Hollywood production--lots of glitter, but little substance. It was not a total loss; it piqued my curiousity. I must learn more of this person, Joan of Arc. I've ordered two biographies from Amazon.com and I rented the Leelee Sobieski version of this movie. The Sobieski version is better. Milla Jovovich was good, but Leelee was a much more convincing 18 year old girl."
15180,0,Non Historical Joan of Arc,"Having done extensive research and study into Joan of Arc, this film is loaded with historical flaws. It appears to be the Director's personal fantasy of Joan. He portrays her as ""wacked out"" or a ""mental case"". He introduces a murder/rape which never happened as a motivator for Joan. He also plays ""Hollywood"" with many other non-facts. They could have produced a film, following the actual facts, which would have amazed audiences.I have it as a part of my collection to use for comparisons. If you just watch it for visuals and entertainment, it is fine."
15187,0,Classic Hardy,"This book probably holds most draw for Hardy fans. Due from time period, from a young author, and from particular style, the book is a jumbled read at points-- but the plot is beyond reproach. Overall, quite entertaining. Did not impress me as much as another Hardy book, Jude the Obscure, but still was by no stretch a disappointment. Very interesting quotes on female nature to be had as an added bonus."
15197,0,I liked it; my kids didn't,"My kids (8 and 11) kept waiting for the funny parts - which never came. The 8-year-old enjoyed it more than the older one. The scene where the mother dies in a car crash is very graphic so beware. This was hard for us because we lost a grandmother this way. Other than that, I thought the whole thing was charming. While child actor did well, Gérard Depardieu is always the best thing about any movie he's in."
15199,0,Classic Sayers,This captures class and English crime fiction about as well as anything ever published. Sayers is at her usual best in creating a parlor mystery and Lord Peter is at her best in solving a somewhat complicated crime.
15200,0,"Literary virtues, perhaps, but not my favorite Lord Peter","I'm sorry to say that I did not enjoy this segment of the Lord Peter series. I do think the other reviewers are correct in their assessment of the literary virtues of this work and of the author. My problem is with the idioms of the era. I found myself wishing I had a ""Lord Peter to English"" Dictionary! Please don't misunderstand me - I like this series and I have a growing respect for Dorothy Sayers' work. I simply found myself wondering what on earth these people (the characters in the novel) were talking about. But I bet my grandmother, a contemporary of Lord Peter, would have known...I am reading Sayers' works in order of publication, and so far Clouds of Witness is my favorite."
15201,0,Stuart Little without Mr Whites charm,"This movie is visually very very cute. Hugh Laurie is terrific as always. The mouse is darling. But the storyline does not resemble the book much, and I was much disturbed by the evil fake parents who come to take him from the adoptive ones. This is a movie for little children yet it shows Stuart being led to his death by his supposed mouse parents. When will disney stop making movies about evil mothers? Children can be entertained without being terrorized by such stupid ideas. Read the book to your child, watch a Wooster and Jeeves movie, enjoy Michael Fox in something else, and skip this one.."
15208,0,Starts off good,"Book starts out great with an incredible story about a mishap in a hot spring, unfortunately most of the remaining stories of disaster are no where near as colorful. There are way to many names thrown around in the various stories for me to keep track of.Not a long read, 200pgs but after about 150 I found myself just wishing I was done with it.Great for kind of a historical document about deaths in the area, but since no maps of the area were provided it means almost nothing to me (I have never been to the park).Average book, just not great like i was hoping."
15213,0,Thought Provoking,"I watched this movie and it stuck with me for several hours. Since I remember the energy crisis back in the '70s, when this film was done, I picked up on a number of cultural references of the time. Not to mention we again have the same sort of problems going on today with high fuel costs.And since I'm an English major, this allowed me to dissect the story line and pick on several references that explain the end. The frightening final use for the transfer system for instance. The people found in the rail cars and the deaf girl the group found, are all clues to the final scene.What I did find annoying was no clear reference to what happened to create such a world nor the fate of what happened to the rest of the group heading for the coast.Finally, the film was an interesting experiment and could be used as an exercise in story telling for classes. I would recommend it for anyone who likes to think about visual images and story lines."
15224,0,Fits great but not very soft,"This is my second set of Sealy Best Fit sheets. The first set I bought was substantially softer and was not sateen. I'm not sure if its the sateen that makes it less soft or what (maybe after a few washes it'll soften up). Aside from the fact that this set is not as soft as I exepcted, everything else is great. I have a very deep mattress (about 20 inches) and this is the only fitted sheet that fits without coming up on the sides. The head and end of the fitted sheet is made of jersey material which allows it to hug around the corners very well to maintain a snug fit. I would recommend the non sateen version of this set if you're looking for great fit and softness."
15226,0,Decent Sheets,"Decent sheets for the money. I've had trouble with coner slipping off of our super pillow top mattress. Nice color, medium weight, probably wouldn't order again because of corner slippage. They'd definitely be good for a standard pillow top or less."
15228,0,"Great movie, bad DVD.","A wonderful movie, but the DVD quality is truly bad. First, the opening credits are cut off of both sides! Which means that the scenes are also badly trimmed. Second, the picture quality is faded and grainy. The film splices show and make the picture jump. Third, the sound is horrible, low and fuzzy.Other classic movies from this era which I own are in pristine condition. I can only conclude that the original print was in poor shape and that the transfer to DVD was very poorly done. 5 stars content, 1 star quality: rating 3 stars. This is the version released by Madacy."
15241,0,Finally found it!,"I was very excited about finding a new copy of the mini-series, Chiefs. I searched for what seems like years! I wasn't disappointed in the service or condition of the product. The sound and video wasn't as crisp as it could have been...but, it wasn't bad either. (I expected it wouldn't be dead-on given it was a reproduction.)No complaints. I'd order from this supplier again."
15247,0,Very difficult to read,"I read this book, expecting it to be similar to Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. However, I struggled through the old English monologues of some of the characters. While this is an amusing tale of a 19th century American attempting to modernize 6th century Britain, I wish I had applied my recreational reading time elsewhere.This paperback printing is difficult to read, too. The words run too close to the spine, requiring me to hold the book flat to read."
15251,0,Remote [is awful],"The remote control on Toshiba SD3750 [is awful].First of all the remote does not control tv(volume, channel etc). For the price the remote should have been a universal one. Anyway who wants to watch a DVD and not control the TV. Also the LED that transmits the IR from remote to TV is visible. There is no cover so it looks ugly and in future break if you drop it on the floor.Second of all the on screen menu is slow and very confusing and pain to go through. However one good thing is that while you are traversing the menu, you can continue to watch the DVD and the menu items move to the sides."
15258,0,Interesting first-hand account from survivor.,"This book was written by a Japanese doctor who lived in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing. It was interesting reading an account from a survivor. Since it comes from a diary and not just memories, in the beginning the people were not even aware of the nature of the bomb. There is more of a technical medical nature than the average reader would prefer, but it's still worth the read. Most surprising to me was the attitude of the people once they knew what kind of bomb it was."
15262,0,Good for Small To-Do Projects,"Intriguing design, probably best for at-home projects that call for small tools. I have to admit, I don't see much use coming from the serrated blade or knife that comes in the multi-tool, due to size, but the other parts (especially the pliers) certainly are usable."
15266,0,Effective protection with mediocre FM reception,"The Peltor WorkTunes work well as hearing protection, but the radio function is pretty marginal. The tuning knob gives you no idea what frequency you are on and the tiniest movement of the little knob will hurtle you right past 2 or 3 stations. It is difficult to accurately tune into a station. When you do find the station by listening long enough for ""station identification"", the reception isn't particularly good. I would suggest saving a few bucks and forgetting the ""Tunes"" or spending more and getting decent radio."
15284,0,One CD is just not enough,"Gabriel's talent makes a one CD greatest hits package a near impossibility; consider this instead a sampler. Dominated by songs from his commercial breakthrough SO, SHAKING THE TREE really only takes a look at three of Gabriel's works (III, Security, SO) with a few novelties like the title cut from Youssou N'Dour's THE LION and a few other works re-recorded with some musical adjustments. It really is for completists only and you'll be better served with HIT, but even that falls short of really capturing the essence of this artist."
15290,0,"Okay, but....","I bought these beans for experimenting with homemade soy milk and tofu. The flavor is fine, but in 4 cups of soy beans, there is at least 1/4 cup of beans that will not absorb water. I don't know all the reasons that beans don't absorb water, but I will say that in trials with 4 other brands of soybeans, I have not seen this problem. I pick through the beans carefully in any case, it just makes the task more difficult when I have to pick out tiny round beans. Additionally, when the shipment arrived, the bag was unsealed completely, not so much as a twistie tie or knot in the bag."
15291,0,Nice to see Janeway for once not in command,"I generally don't like Captain Janeway and it was hard at first to get hang of her being the only one present, but this story was well written. Diane Carey is one of my favorite authors and I think she's done well again."
15294,0,Original Thought for a Zombie Flick,"I can only give the movie 3 stars due to the Commandant & the X-Boyfriend. The ""C"" by any other name would still be a ""C"". Very stereotypical of a lesbian hate-monger, trying to prove that her balls are bigger than everyone else's. I've seen too many of the X in real life. Idiots like that need to die.Onto the movie...Outside of the above mentioned, I enjoyed it. The support group was great. Every emotion was brought out in there. The donuts & coffee were an unexpected treat. I dont understand why every movie that has racism (dead-ism?), hatred & bigotry needs an American flag in those scenes. Because I have one on the front of my house make me a racist?If you're looking for nudity, you'll have to go to the deleted scenes for that. Otherwise, good movie that had the potential to be great."
15304,0,"Some good moments, but disappointing","Gabriel's work during this period was becoming more dense, more intricate and exact. He'd been playing with synthesizers for a couple of years and started to compose music that relied on atmosphere rather than standard chord progressions (call it ""modal rock""). This album shows Gabriel and his band stripping the compositions to the bone for simpler live execution. On the more generic songs (DIY, I Don't Remember, On the Air) it works. Unfortunately, the same process turns some tracks into semi-disco mush, complete with grating synth drums and fake piano. Not as engaging as ""Secret World Live"", but the versions of Intruder and Family and the Fishing Net compensate for the album's flaws."
15305,0,Just speaker wire,"Nothing speacial, nothing bad, just plain old copper wire with plastic around it. Love that it was cheap though!"
15317,0,"good, but...","This is a well-written, well-plotted story, as you would expect from such a respected author.BUTPersonally, I have a problem with the story. The man character looses his individuality, becoming someone else. The (explicitly stated, too) message is that the trade-off was worth it - rather than being another unsuccesfull actor, the protagonist has become a significant political personality and can carry on realising his original's vision.This does not go well with any notion of the individual human being's intrinsic worth and I'm surprised that no one else seems to be troubled by this.Still, a very good and diverting read.The snapshots of a Martian culture are particularly memorable."
15319,0,Painful... unless your near the router.,"I dearly love the little box ^^but it's only worth having if you can be next to the router itself. The drop off point is terrible, the main place i use my laptop is upstairs (and the router is downstairs) i've even tried hanging the box over the banister rail but no use - it still disconnects anywhere from 1 minute to about 30 minutes (if i'm lucky).My advice is that this is good until you can afford to upgrade and your not actually going to be playing any online games or anything that requires the internet to be on constantly.My family have the wireless cards installed into their computers and they have no problems no matter where they are in the house. My next move is going to see if i can have a card installed some how, but until that day i guess i'll stick with the little black box with a strange temperment.It's actually good if your near the router itself, i just wish it was as good around the house.. i mean thats what a laptop's for right? moveability."
15322,0,Good and Long,"I have to agree with one of the other reviews, this film was interesting. Although it had a totally different twist to it than the books, I found it quite enjoyable. A bunch of the war stuff could have been cut out while still retaining the story line. That would have made a fairly good two hour movie. The price of a good two hour movie might have been less thereby giving the customer his money's worth."
15325,0,IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT ANNE OF GREEN GABLES REPORTS,"After seeing the first two Anne of Green Gables films, I couldn't believe how wonderful they were.I plan to see this last part of the trilogy, but i would like to first just say several things...1.) Keep in perspective that the first two Annes were made in 1985 and 1986. I was shocked to see that the last part was produced in the year 2000. Only a few short years ago!!!!2.) The actors are older~~~ALOT OLDER!!!!! Some have unfortunately passed on...not a good thing!!! So you're going to see alot of differences in nearly 15 years. The magic may not be the same!3.) For the lady who has written her own sequel, go to sullivansboutique.com, and there is the site of the man who directed, and produced it. It's a Canadian site, and you may get the address of how to contact them from there. Good Luck!!!"
15326,0,"Has its faults, but not a bad film","I enjoy the Anne of Green Gables films series, however this third installment to the film series, was somewhat disappointing. It was not a bad film, but I thought the plotting was bad. There was to many tragedies in this film, but I glad the film had a happy ending. Megan Follows was great as Anne Shirley. The first two films of the Anne of Green Gables film series were a lot better. but this third film had a lot of faults and poor plotting to the story."
15348,0,"A great album, but there's some real problems","I consider this his weakest regular album until ""Up"" because of two issues:First; Robert Fripp's otherwise excellent production distorts Gabriel's voice for the entire album. This distortion might've been what Gabriel wanted, by since the 1st day I heard it, I thought the distortion is annoying.Second; I actually had the original single ""D.I.Y."" b/w ""Perspective"" on Irish Charisma BEFORE the album came out and ""Perspective"" on that 45 is longer than the edited version on the album. This edit has NEVER been corrected and the original-length of ""Perspective"" has never been issued since.Third; The remastered version - tho it's best I've heard it - should've had the remix of ""D.I.Y."", the long ""Perspective"" and ""Teddy Bear"" as bonus tracks.Otherwise, it's fine...but the distorted vocals still annoys me.Great material, tho"

15361,0,whats the real published date?,looking at the reviews on this book and they all seem to be great but why are the the reviews dated from 2002 if the book didnt come out till 2010? just confused. so how old is this book? im looking for something up to date. it may have been a great book from 2003 but TIM BURTON has done a great many things since than.
15368,0,"Good value, decent webcam, can work with Windows XP","Windows XP compatibility issues aside, this is a decent webcam with decent video quality. You can adjust the sharpness by rotating the circular frame around the camera eye, and there are three colored covers that come with the webcam - green, red, and blue. Although this webcam was only designed for compatibility up to Windows 2000, I have gotten the webcam to work on Windows XP just fine with the latest Windows 2000 drivers from www.mic-innovations.com. Occasionally (once every few months), I'll have to reinstall the drivers when Windows XP suddenly recognizes the webcam as ""new hardware"", but that's not much of a hassle."
15375,0,NOT THAT THRILLED,CONCERT WAS NOT THAT GREAT HER FAREWELL CONCERT IS ALOT BETTER THAN THIS ONE WAS. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN SORRY
15386,0,Not very pleased with purchase,"For those that are buying for the digitally challenged, it is a good purchase for the price. However, I was not very happy. I found other frames that were very comparable in price that came with many more bells and whistles (interchangeable frames, holds more than 20 pictures internally, loads pictures much faster, etc).On a more positive note, I did rate it 3 stars because it is pretty and very easy to use."
15392,0,A fair assessment of a more than fair Hero,"This book is a two afternoon read. It gives a good story of Washington as America's first true hero. It is not a great historical biography. The portion on Washington's morals is good, but is more philosophical and religious than historical. If you really want to learn about Washington, pick up Douglas Southall Freeman's pulitzer winning work (the abridgement is best unless you have a whole year to do nothing but read!)"
15395,0,good reception but extras don't work with frs on,"I looked at the Motorola 6310 and this Uniden 440 because they both have weather channels and FM radio and other similar extras. I chose this one because it was half the price of the Motorola. Unfortunately you can have FM or FRS but not both. On the Motorola the FM will be interrupted by a FRS transmission so you can have the best of both worlds. Also the call button gets hit accidentally very easily, so it's hard to tell when someone is really trying to call you or not. I have a Motorola 6200 that has recessed buttons and haven't had any false calls with it. I think I'll return the Uniden and get the Motorola 6310 or 6320 after all."
15399,0,"Too beautiful to live, too beautiful to truly love","The film that launched a thousand copycat hairspray ads, and certainly more parodied than actually seen these days, Elvira Madigan is as light as a butterfly floating on the breeze - a beautiful to look at but short-lived tale of two doomed runaway lovers who, being Swedish, naturally end up committing suicide. Pia Degermark is beautiful, Thommy Berggren is a more beautiful Oskar Werner lookalike, the scenery is beautiful, the Mozart and Vivaldi soundtrack is beautiful, the photography is beautiful, the spilled wine that's the closest we get to seeing any blood is beautiful and even the one brief bit of vomiting onscreen isn't entirely ugly. It's pleasant enough and it's easy to understand its popularity, but it's too beautiful to truly love."
15404,0,typical antenna for typical price,"Nothing special about this unit. I would have liked the insulating base to be of better material. I'm afraid that the thin silicon membrane will tear easily, and was better secured to the magnetic base. Removing the unit from your vehicle to clean or wax the vehicle, causes the membrane to detatch, and it's so thin, tearing may be an issue.Also, basic instructions on how to tune your antenna to your radio, using a SWR meter would have been good.It should be noted that you can pick up this exact antenna for the same price at any truck stop."
15407,0,Filling in the biographical gaps,"This book is cobbled from pieces in a wide variety of magazines, reviews & little journals--with some chapters written for the book--so the point of view does vary.Fox's story follows her biography _Borrowed Finery_, which was amplified by the novel _The Western Coast_. _The Coldest Winter_ fills out the story of her beginnings as a writer & explores how she gained a foothold in the world. She explores the oppression of both the communist bloc & Franco's Spain, by talking about the people who crossed her wandering path.There are astonishing vignettes, such as seeing Winston Churchill in the street, drunk, being steered along by a group of men, while he is weeping & mascara runs down his face. (She later found that Churchill's lashes & brows were so pale that he always wore mascara in public.) There are many such stunning moments. It's a fast read, but worthwhile."
15410,0,"If I'd bought tickets for this concert, I would have been so pissed off","Wow. I'm a huge Stones fan and have virtually their entire library. This one probably gets played the least, even less than their other (mediocre) live albums. The Stones live collection really isn't that good (except for Get Your Ya-Yas Out!), and this is probably the worst entry. The playlist is a joke...I just can't believe paying Stone tix prices and only getting that selection of songs. And Mick just sounds so LAZY as he sings most of them. It's sloppy and uninspired.It's a disappointing entry. I have it because I wanted my collection complete. If you're more selective, just skip this one."
15415,0,Good for the price.,"For 60 bucks this is a good vest to try and see if weighted vests will work for you.It is one size fits all.It fits well and doesn't move around, but the arm holes are a little tight when reaching out in front. Otherwise the fit is ok.It is a little tough to put on loaded with weight.Not as comfortable as the X Vest, but it is 1/3 the price.If you know you want one and will use it, I suggest the X vest.But as I stated, this one is good to see if this type of exercise will work for you."
15419,0,Okay - I guess????,"Well, the material seems nice (we'll see after a few washings) and the color was fine. But the cutting and sewing has a lot to be desired. I'm guessing these are irregulars.The bottom sheet fit nicely and was generously made. The top one, however, was an unusual shape (not straight lines) and on top of that, we realized that it had been sewn the wrong way.The wide band usually on the top of the sheet has to be on the sides of the bed in order for it to be long enough to cover everything. It's not a huge deal. You just don't have the usual wide band near the pillows - it runs down the side of the bed.In all, for the price, I would likely buy them again for my own bed - but I'm very glad that I didn't give them as a gift!"
15425,0,"One Master ""Piece"", one fun, the rest are up for grabs.","The main reason ( Which became the only reason ) I bought ""Stuntman"" was for the exquisite and brilliant ten minute ""Drunken Mozart in the Desert"", which is arguably the best piece of solo work that the Father of Tangerine Dream (Frose) has ever released. The title track is a lot of fun. It would be perfect for gymnastic practices( Not that I do any of course ). The rest, well...not too memorable. I love a couple of the title names at least. ( Who couldn't get a smile out of a title named ""Detroit Snackbar Dreamer""?) If you can find it used or on sale, it's worth buying. It could definately use a remastering.The biggest irony about Tadream, to myself at least, is that, as a rule, I find other(ex) members of the band's solo work superior. (""Klemania"" by Franke and ""Wuvein Reit"" by Schmoelling come immediately to mind)"
15426,0,trebly but good,"Interesting to revisit after hearing the first Banyan album. It puts that later recording in an interesting light, since a similar sample-collage technique was employed here nearly a decade previous.

15431,0,Not Ambrose best effort,A small book about a small but important WW2 episode. The people in the story are real heros not made up so that makes it well worth the reading but it is not one of this authors best outings.

Does kind of give surfersa bad rep though! Lori Petty and Gary Buseyare superb in supporting roles. In fact Busey(until he's killed off) steals most of hisscenes, if not the whole movie as the robberycop vet who takes Reeves under his wing andsteers him in the right direction. A good come-back for Swazey after the stupid 'Ghost' andsappy 'Dirty Dancing'! That killer wave in Aus-tralia/finish is outstanding! {Actually three-and-one half-stars)."
15444,0,''2ND TIER BAND INDEED'',"Reading these overblown hyped up reviews was truly a treat!!To much acid i suspect,especially S.king.The claim that they had better '5 part' harmony then the BEACH BOYS is especially ridiculous and also the claim that J.Spence was a top 5 best guitarist makes me cringe ,just listen to his vibrato and string bending and you'll hear the same amatuerish uncontrolled drivel that many lower tiered guitarist displayed in that era.I know this soundS like just a bashing session but it is not,it's just reality., the music on this disc is very good for what it is a SAN FRANCISCO TYPE MUSIC BAND, NO BETTER NO WORSE THAN THE OTHERS FROM THAT AREA AND TIME!"

This 1974 remake is not quite as good as the original or the first remake, but is 10 times better than the 1988 remake (""Switching Channels""). The main problem with this movie is that the attempt at ""adding jokes"" distracts away from humorous situations. Carol Burnett's performance as the killer's girlfriend is absolutely horrible. All that aside, it is still an entertaining story, but stick to the original or the 1940's remake."

15472,0,I've seen worse! But not much worse!,"Kung-fu's response to Plan 9 From Outer Space. Sadly, the action sequences cannot compensate for wretched dialogue, stale directing. But Lundgren and Lee do fine with what they're given. And I have this on video! Somebody PLEASE rescure Dolph from this! Did anybody pay money to see this!"
15475,0,Very good fun.,Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee team up to beat the baddies in a well paced and earnest adventure.
15481,0,a bit cheaply made,"i have had a few of these sockets break, they are very cheaply made, the walls are too thin, the teeth that bite the bolt head are too weak, I would not of minded paying more for a more durable product, when it comes to removing a bolt that has a bolt head that is rounded, the job has then become bad already, need a good quality tool."
15492,0,Why did this cd win so many grammy awards last year?,"I know that Lauryn is a good rapper and some of the songs are cool, but overall it is kinda boring and just blah. I liked Doo Woop (That Thing). To Zion was a outstanding song and I like how Carlos Santana did the guitar for the song. It was ok. Not earth shattering like Third Eye Blind's ""Blue"""
15495,0,Good album.,"It's everything I expect from a debut album; nice new music but lacks almost everything else. What I have to give credit for in this album is the lyrics, I just love them. From Lauryn herself, (on ""Lost Ones,"" probably the best track) she raps: ""I know you don't wanna hear my opinion/ But there comes a time when you must choose one..."" If you like rap or hip-hop, this is a must have."
15499,0,The Book is Better,"Usually I know I'm going to like anything by BBC before I even see it. But I was a bit leery about their version of David Copperfield because the book is so long and they couldn't possibly fit everything into a movie.I'm not happy with what they took out. David's best friend from school, Tommy Traddles, isn't even mentioned. The acting, scenery, costumes, music, etc...is all nice. But I came away feeling like something was missing from this vibrant story about a boy growing up.Although, I must add I still cried about the last part with Agnes.Overall, this film was well done but not fulfilling. Not a classic rewatchable movie in my opinion. If you have time just read the book (it's 500+ pages though)."
15505,0,RECORDING DIGITAL AUDIO,"THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE CARD IS THAT WHEN I RECORD DIGITAL AUDIO USING DIGITAL ORCHESTRATOR PRO THROUGH THE SANTA CRUZ, THROUGH A MICROPHONE, IT DISTORTS THE AUDIO.

15506,0,"Fair 80s nostalgia, but the score is best","For those who are looking for the original soundtrack score to the film, it's done by Thomas Newman. The same artist who did some other more recent and great soundtracks: American Beauty, Meet Joe Black, etc. I'm trying to find it too, but believe it may be unavailable."
15508,0,She Doesn't Know What She Wants,"This book started off great and ended pretty well but the middle wasn't great. The writing was excellent but the characters were weird and superficial. the plot went off on many different tangents. Overall not bad, but not great."
15528,0,The Outsider Gains Acceptance!,"Of the 3 Grisham novels i have read, this one seems totally out of Sync. Theres no fast paced city law firms but instead the slow relaxing pace of Deep South. Although the pace of the book will make it difficult for many readers to read ""just one more chapter"" before bed, the book still has its place.The deep and detailed characterisation allowed me to bond with the William and those he was closest to, which unwittingly had me rooting for a happy ending. Grisham, details every facet of being part of a small community so that by the time the ending comes the reader feels like they are part of it.The book starts from an outsiders point of view and over each page i became engrossed in the simple lives of those involved in the towns small drama's, and was able to see things through the eyes of William as he tries to blend in.An interesting read, with a bitter sweet conclusion!"
15530,0,"easy to figure out, but still a good read","I was hoping for another sleepless night poring over the pages of my latest purchase - alas, I just knew from the title title that JG was back in the saddle and about to hand us another heart-stopping,suspense-filled saga. NOT SO...(although my review of the book is delayed, I did buy it on the release date).I enjoyed the lead characters way of gradually ""finding his space"" among the ""regulars"", but the storyline was VERY predictable.I won't tell (I hate when people spoil the ending!!!) who the killer is, but JG gave a hint of some of the vintage Grisham stuff to which we've grown accustomed. Read this book or watch American Idol, both will probably conjure up the same emotions."
15542,0,"Typical Grisham, good, but could have been great....","I often wonder if John Grisham didn't write such a good first 3 books, would he be nearly as popular as he is now. He is a good writer, his books flow, they are easy to read, but they just end....I often find myself saying, a book was way too long, I find his too short....This was a good story, well developed, that ended in 2 pages....Maybe that is what keeps his books alive, they are all fast paced and build, I just wish the endings would develop also. I liked The Last Juror, it was good, but I wonder, could it have been great?"
15546,0,Over-rated.,"I'm curious as to whether or not people get paid by the weight of there book. The Last Juror by John Grishham is an over-rated book, full of long dribbley paragraphs.Some of the character development was sub-par, and the plot is repetitive and somewhat predictable. Another problem I have with the book is that it just *ends* in basically one chapter. It seemed like he was like ""Alright, I'm done. Time to end this train wreck"".Even though I feel this book isn't John Grishams best, I've still read a lot worse, which is why I gave it 3 stars."
15547,0,Good but misleading,"Read the book and you'll understand, the book doesn't stick to the title, and actually, doesn't stick to much of what the backcover says. Borrow the book from a friend, or local library, because this book, is just average. His much better ones are, Pelican Brief, Street Lawyer, and A time to kill. Fantastic books, that if haven't already captured your attention, will."
15562,0,awesome kinda but great in a decent way.,this album is pretty sweet - it made me set my neighbors house on fire... so its pretty sweet. It then inspired me to invent Google - the worlds leading search engine.its craziness is cool. you should listen. it talks to you. SHUT UP ALBUM.
15582,0,Ok book,"I had to buy this for a class, its much cheaper than at the university book stores and has better availability. Decent book that gets you familiar with the construction process."
15589,0,It's quite heavy....but solid construction,"The shower head seems well constructed, but I was surprised how heavy it is. I had an existing mount which pivots up/down for your desired level and it was not strong enough to hold it up. I rigged it so it wont fall down now as I wanted keep it stationary anyway. Otherwise a good product. Nice selection of sprays."
15592,0,a la The Others but without the intrigue,"This is a thriller that is supposed to have twists ad turns and keep the viewer guessing, but in the first 45 minutes of the movie I just couldn't bring myself to care about the characters. The only reason I kept watching the film is because I have tremendous respect for the leads - Anne Hathaway and Patrick Wilson. I didn't particularly care for Hathaway's character's fate, but after the first set up of the movie, I realized the feel of the film that was very reminiscent of The Others. What intrigued me the most about this movie, however, was the idea of purgatory and how one must come into terms with their own mortality and death."
15603,0,OK locking gas cap,This locking gas cap is just OK. Its made of all plastic so it would be easy to break into but will deter those without any tools. Clumsy but easy to lock and unlock. I use mine with a 2009 Toyota Tacoma truck.
15604,0,we`ll see...,"After reading several reviews on this product I have to agree with most comments in regards to the locking fuel cap being poorly made. The Cap fits fine for the application. However the key mechanism is flimsy at best. The quality of the plastic components are not what I remember a Stant Locking Fuel cap to be. They def cheapened out on their manufacturing process`s.I gave the Stant Locking Fuel cap a 3 star rating only bc it does fit and is doing what the intended use is for. I do feel that if someone wants to remove the cap by force, they absolutely can. I primarily purchased this product based on Stant`s reputation in the Auto market, but this one leaves myself a bit disappointed. This is being used as a deterrent to help prevent vandals from pouring anything foreign into the tank. It does operate correctly when following the unlocking/locking procedures."
15606,0,"Meh, its ok i guess...","Cheap, lock/tumbler is low quality and proves to be difficult at times to unlock with out two hands (tricky when theres some depth to the gas cap from the body like on a truck). Even though it seemed ready to snap apart at any time or the key break off inside, this cap held up for over 2 years before i opted to go back to the OEM cap. Never any problems with it sealing either which surprised me."
15611,0,good product but bad sosftware,"The product was nice, the problem is ths software , there are not many options, if i can buy a new ad more powefull software his will thebest product"
15613,0,"Some good, some bad -- I'm enjoying it on balance","There's both bad and good to say about this one.Ok here are the downsides I have experienced:1. Crummy reception, weak range. I had to move my router much closer to the unit before I could get clear signal with no dropouts, and the video feeds STILL tend to choke.2. Miserable onscreen display, finding files is inordinately slow and messy.3. Cranky remote control. The unit sometimes jams for no discernible reason4. Tech support -- the guys you call haven't got a clue.On the other hand --I enjoy AOL radio and Live365 radio (available with the latest firmware update).MP3 files from my hard disk play OK, once I can locate them.This unit will do some useful things for you if you are willing to give it some TLC. It's reasonably priced and looks OK in a stack of sound/video components."
15621,0,"David must sack Reeves, pronto!","I expected a lot more than I got. It is still good fun listening the first few times. After the 5th time I got really bored. I really think the album would have been a lot better if guitarist and co-writer Reeves Gabrels would have been sacked. I think he is the weak point in Bowie's normally creative composing. He is too much of an influence to Mr. Bowie. If you compare the guitarists Carlos Alomar (He worked with Bowie on several albums in the late seventies and the early eighties) and Gabrels you will understand what I'm talking about. The best way to discribe Reeves' guitarplay is that it's whining. It has no rythem like that of Carlos. Reeves really tries to give the impression that he can play like Hendrix. But he most certainly doesn't. If Bowie sacks Gabrels and takes on a new guitarist, the next album will be a lot better. Maybe some collaborations with some other artists will help him regain his creativity. Excluding the pathetic R&B artists of today."
15628,0,Mixed Feelings,"Interesting CD. Sometimes, Mountain sounds like a combination of Rob Zombie and ZZ Top and sometimes there's almost a hint of Jim Morrison and the Doors (on Mystic Fire for instance). This is one CD I really can't totally recommend, but can't really say it's all bad either. ""Mystic Fire"", ""The Sea"", and especially ""Better Off With The Blues"" are pretty good tunes.""Fever"", the old cover done by who knows how many ""lounge singers"" and jazzed up here just doesn't seem to belong. I would have preferred another original track from the band. I like the three songs previously mentioned, but otherwise, I'd probably leave this one alone."

15652,0,OK,"This book was OK, but totally not one of my faves. This book is about Claudia and Alan. Claudia really likes the way Alan is right now, but something is missing in him...could it be his humor? Is Alan trying too hard to impress Claudia? to find out, read this book!"
15661,0,Hmm,"I rented this movie, and am glad it was just a rental instead of a purchase. A young man meets the girl that his father was having an affair with, and finds out that she is pregnant, the baby is his half-sibling. He starts to fall in love with her, but his newly-widowed mother will have none of it. Dad died at the beginning of the movie from an heart attach, Mom was responsible for it because she told her son to scare him, and son scared him all too well, so he also has to live with this. It's an interesting movie with a cliched ending, so I give it 3 out of 5 stars."
15670,0,Trims nice when it stays together,I bought this edge band trimmer because I was familiar with the manufacture name Freud. I have quality saw blades from the company but was a little disappointed by the design of this tool. When not in use the two halves come appart too easily allowing the spring to fall out. When I store it I have to wrap a rubber band around it to keep it from falling apart. Other than that it works great while in use.
15677,0,Nostalgic but a Bit Predictable,"A large part of the episode is a power struggle between UNIT led by the Brigadier and another high ranking British official. The British official is too stereo typed and predictable in his motives. The intentions of Axos is also obvious very early on. As a result, this story doesn't build up a lot of tension but plays out as you might expect. Just too black and white for my tastes.The Axonite's appear in two forms. I rather like the costumes of their humanoid form. Very effective for a show on a budget.Jo's role in this is to run off on her own and get in trouble and then scream for help. The better Who stories would get the companion more involved."
15680,0,In the realm of the supernatural,"As a purveyor of anything supernatural, I found this video to be a decent account of bizarre phenomena. The video comprises mainly of interviews with witnesses to poltergeist and other behavior. At times the video is of poor quality to the point where it is hard to see and hear images and voices. But, the video weaves interesting tales that provide entertainment and helpful hints for research of this phenomena. A last note is that the video may only be interesting to those that are truly serious about the supernatural. This video is not for people who's main purpose to buy is to frighten themselves or others. With that note....enjoy!"
15688,0,Good...not outstanding,Amusing..but her negativity starts to annoy after a bit. Her husband deserves a medal!
15689,0,I dug it - Generation thing? City thing? Maybe,"I wasn't expecting to see all the poor reviews. As everyone says, this book doesn't focus exclusively on food and cooking... and from what I just read from ""the foodies,"" a sense of humor, empathy for a beginning cook and an interest in her story may be pre-requisites serious cooks 'don't have time for.' Now the reason I got a kick out of this story is because my friends and I are about Julie's age (+ a few years,) - we're city people with cramped kitchens, foul-mouths, who cook with cocktail in hand... most lack dining rooms but none lack the will to entertain in style and try new things in the kitchen. While things generally turn out these days, souffles and all, I certainly remember the days when every dish was still an experiment. Great writer? Great cook? Maybe not, but give her time. I was just glad to see her get out of that bogus job, which is more than most the people I know have figured out how to do."
15697,0,"Tasty, in a fast food way","I was really looking forward to enjoying this piece of light fiction and am disappointed. While it's not the worst book I've ever read, I am growing tired of Julie Powell and friends excessive drinking, vulgar language, and her need to bash Republicans about every 15 pages. The book is clever, but not particularly well written and I can only surmise that she is getting rave reviews from the mainstream media on the basis of her hatred of conservatives. For example, in one chapter someone asks if she's a Republican and she exclaims, no, Republicans don't wear vintage. Seriously? She might want to get out more and get that ugly chip off of her shoulder. And by the way, if you love animals, this is not the book for you anyway."
15702,0,slim for the money,"there is a novella based on a true story that is horrific, but the true crime has no happy ending, why the writer melowed it down is beyond me. so the novella aint that good.two bonus stories are excellent as most of mr. ketchums stories.the book is only over 100 pages, not worth the money"
15708,0,Not THAT good,"My son got his hands out very quick... The blanket makes some holes when you close it, and hé got his hands outside... And that is enough to wake him up :(I rate it 3 stars cuz of that... But its cheap, so i Will survive :)"
15709,0,Micro fleece works better for my son,"I've been wrapping my son with micro fleece swaddle-me for a few months without any problem. He was 5 months old and using the size large. I thought to give this cotton one a try since it is getting warmer. This cotton material is nice and soft and thin. I like the soft feeling of it, but it doesn't work very well to hold my son's limbs tucked in. One morning he woke up with one of his fists out from the top and the other one from the middle opening, and I don't know how he did it but his legs were busted out from the pouch which has never happened with the micro fleece.I have 2 kids and invested in several baby wraps includes highly rated expensive Miracle Wrap, but the micro fleece swaddle-me has worked the best for us."
15711,0,Not so great.,"Didn't work for me, the material is kind of cheap, and not warm at all. A flannel material would have been better. I don't recommend."
15714,0,Shrunk in the wash.... buy bigger size,"We love snuggies! I bought both a micro fleece one and this cotton one, both size large. The microfleece is perfect! This cotton one shrunk to almost a small size and I REALLY NEED A LARGER size for my lil man. However, it's very lightweight and soft and is perfect for warmer nights when you just want a little something over them. Just buy a big size, because it really shrinks."
15717,0,"Ok, but there are better.","I've used this and other Kiddopotamus products. They're not bad, but never rise to greatness. The Miracle blanket worked much better for keeping our baby tightly swaddled."
15725,0,Weird,"If you want to be entertained by a weird, mind-bending, freakish horror flick that makes very little sense then this is a good film to watch. A waste of acting talent & money."
15728,0,good product but it turned so hard to be powdered lately,"I like its freeze dried chicken breast treats and all my more than three cats are crazy about it. The reason that I give only 3 stars is because its freeze dried chicken breast treat is turned into so hard (most recent two 21 oz bag purchase) to be pressed into powder form (I use it as food attraction too) and if I insist to press it, my fingers would get hurt. Everytime, I give it to my more than 3 cats, I worry the possibility of choking by those more than too many hard pieces and even get hurt by some sharp small pieces(I have to threw them away).I have been given this company's products to my cats for more than 3 years. Well, if its chicken treat does not get imprvement (or back to its old form, easy to be pressed) at my next auto delievery, I think I need to find other sources.I either buy its products through amazon.com or dirctly from its website."
15730,0,Spider-Man II is a safe family film that stays fairly....,"...true to the comic series. Peter Parker is still a bit whiny in this film as he continues to battle his own identity as well as super villian Doctor Octopus (the real star of the film). The dvd is jam-packed and well worth the money. I just hope we get a bit less sap in Spider-Man III and Peter Parker can start acting like a confident young man soon. Still not sure how Spider-Man can pick up a car, but an brutal uppercut to Doc Ock's chin just stuns him instead of removing his head....Superhero physics I guess."
15740,0,"it was ok, but i dont get the hype","I thought this movie was as slow as the first one. Too much filler. Kids dont want to see spidermans financial and relationship problems, they want to see him"
15742,0,not as good as first of Raimi's Spiderman movies,I didn't quite enjoy Spiderman 2 as much as I did the first of Raimi's Spiderman movies. What I disliked about the movie is that it was dragged down by moments of silliness that were a bit more jarring than in the first movie. Some of the goofy scenes should have been cut and instead the production team should have used that screen-time to more effectively develop Doc Ock's character and the romantic sub-plot.
15745,0,A good look at an older viewpoint,"Overall a decent book, but for a conservative, traditional perspective I have to say that I did not agree with several chapters and a few points the author promoted."
15749,0,Light reading,"An enjoyable enough read -- although like some other reviewers, I am somewhat skeptical of the accuracy of Smith's research. The characters are fairly one dimensional and the ""bad guys"" are prototypical.Beyond that, it is entertaining -- kinda like a summer action flick -- lots of action, not much substance.Kid Alert! This novel has some extremely graphic sex scenes."
15758,0,The History of Corvettes,"This book would be good for people who want to know more about the history of corvettes. I would suggest this book to people who collect cars and want to make that collection bigger. My favorite corvette is the 1963 Stingray. I like it because of the rareness of the car. I also like it because of the split rear window and the spine running down the center of the roof. This book was all about the history of the corvette from start to now. They talked about the different types of corvettes and the rareness of some of them. The most expensive corvette was the 1963 stingray. It is the most expensive because of the split rear window, the spine, and they only made around 1000 of them. My dad has a 1968 camero that I help work on at home. I really like old cars and I like to ride in them as much as possible."
15767,0,Predictable,"When I watch movies that reflects back to a previous time in the main characters life too many times, you know that the villain is , ""going to come back."""
15769,0,"Mixed: mostly outstanding, but some pieces aren't for me","Some of this is too jazzy for me; too abstract. Other parts are unbelievably awesome. This album also goes by the name of ""Bregenz Concerts"""
15778,0,"Pretty Good but silly, too","I like the ideas and the setting but the characters are so stiff-backed and awkward. I was cringing through all the dialogue. Nonetheless, I was able to enjoy this book and the others because it moves at a good pace."

15791,0,Works well before it breaks down,"I bought this because I read great reviews about it and horrible ones about the zune specific monster fm transmitter. When I got it, it was very easy to set up and the quality was much higher than I expected. I was very satisfied for about a year until it started to break. The audio would cut in and out and would only play if i positioned the cable (near the transmitter part) in a certain way. After some time of ghett-rigging it, the audio cut out completely. Since it lasted a full year and worked well I bought a new one this summer. After only 2-3 months of having it, I'm already having the same problem with the audio cutting out or only playing on one side.While I usually love monster, I think it may be time to look for a new transmitter."
15793,0,"Works well when it does work, but doesn't last long.",The setup and use of this FM transmitter was quick and painless. It did work well but after a few months the connector went bad. You could 'jiggle it' to get sound out of it but for what it cost you shouldn't need to do that. I bought the Scosche unit from Amazon and it's been performing just as well as the Monster - I hope this one lasts! The cord isn't as long but its long enough to do the job for my vehicle. I'd give a 5 to the Monster for its function but a 1 for reliability.
15810,0,"For the most part, a pretty good movie...","To me, this movie was just ok. I actually fell in love with the robot, Sonny, and thought he played a better role in the movie than Will Smith did. I spoke to other people and they all agreed that when this movie was being released, a pretty big deal was made out of it, because the budget to make it was pretty large. It was rather disappointing on that scale. The plot was mediocre, and I had my opinions on other ways that it actually should have taken. It is pretty suspenseful throughout in a whodunnit kinda way, but I didn't enjoy the way it ended at all. The visuals ARE amazing, and I was awed at the massive amounts of robots and computer effects. All in all, the visuals and robots make this a great movie to look at, but the plot leaves something to be desired."
15812,0,I robot,"This is an ok movie .It isn't great or even very good good,it's ok.Id would save my money and watch on HBO."
15833,0,Moderately entertaining,This movie is moderately entertaining. Better than I thought it would be. Somewhat predicable. If you like sci-fi then you will enjoy it more.
15836,0,Disappointed,"I also found this book to be disappointing due to the lack of illustrations. The content was very interesting and I learned alot of the history ,but without the illustrations it was not as good. Examples of what was being talked about would have been helpful."
15841,0,Okay. Nothing Special.,"Okay, maybe I'm a little late in reading this... Did a bad thing and saw the movie first, but I was a kid when it came out so I have a decent excuse. (Loved the movie by the way.) But I'm still not 100% sure if I liked Practical Magic.The story is wonderful. Adult fairy tale with beautifully written characters and some pretty bad ass imagery. Buuuttt (there's always a but), I felt really disconnected. I didn't feel like part of the story, and as a major book-lover, that's a big no-no. I just wasn't sure what the hell was going on. Haven't read any other Alice Hoffman books and people just love her, so I guess I was a little disappointed by the whole thing.Glad I finally read it, but a Hoffman fan was not born. Maybe I should have another go at something else of hers. Any recommendations?[...]"
15844,0,I don't know how I feel about this book,"This book seemed really awesome at first. The story line is interesting and the characters are also. I felt it was really in depth about some points but lacked in other areas. I found myself thinking that it was trying to be a ""romance novel"" and just threw in sex scenes whenever possible, making it more of a weak story. I was surprised that it was so much more R rated than the movie. Another part of me was pleasantly surprised that it was so different from the movie since I still could get into it without only thinking of the movie. Overall I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone unless they liked somewhat... I hate to say trashy... romance novels. If you do then it's great! Plus it has a cool story along with it."
15849,0,not her best.,"This isn't Haffman's best, but was still a desent read. I would reccomend it to someone who wasn't expecting anytihng like the movie."
15853,0,Most things I LOVED about the film...were missing from the book,"I would have to place Practical Magic on my top FIVE list of favorite films (The Goonies, Harry Potter, The Secret Garden & Titanic...are also on that list). I love the setting, the mood and the all around feel I have when I watch this movie-those who have seen it know exactly what I mean! I decided to pick up the book, thinking 'how could I not love it?' but behold...I have never seen such a difference between book and film...EVER. Not to say that I didn't like the book, but it was missing everything I loved about ""Practical Magic."" In the film it was real magic...in the book it seemed more like silly little love 'spells' that aunts liked to do in their spare time. The magic was gone...the whole air and feeling...gone. The book was okay and in general I am thankful that it was written...because I love the film!"
15855,0,they are ok,I still feel that you can do same effect using a hair band. The tinny ones that are cheapper. I believe you would get same results.
15859,0,"It's Average, does the job","The base is plastic, and the plant is stuck in it with hot glue, so it looks pretty cheap. Since the base goes under crushed rock in my tank it doesn't really bother me. During washing some of the leaves popped off, but you can just put them back on, as they snap onto the ends of the stems. Some of the leave were missing however upon arrival, which was a bit annoying. Overall, it does the job of adding floral accents to the tank, but it's nothing amazing."
15861,0,"just ok, but kind of not their fault","Received my poster, very nice, lickedy-split. Still waiting for the frame that was part of the deal, first one was damaged. Emailed them twice about status, very nice and responsive CSR's. Even though this was a very low cost item, as consumers, we just want this resolved. Still waiting on the frame about a month after the poster arrived. Again, not their fault and I would buy from them again because of the responsiveness."
15865,0,"Good, Just Good","I was a big fan of their last cd, Songs For the Deaf. It made a huge impact with songs like Millionaire, No One Knows, and First It Giveth. It was a sensational cd. So I must say that Lullibies to Parylize was somewhat of a disappointment, although I expected a decline after the ""breakup"". The Medication was also a good song, but it was less than 2 minutes long. Some other songs like Tangled Up In Plaid, In My Head, and Skin on Skin were average, but not the best that QOTSA had to offer. It is evident that the loss of Nick Oleveri hurt the individuality of the band. Josh Homme put in a great effort, but it just wasn't the same. I hope that this isn't the end of one of the greatest rock bands of recent history."
15866,0,Queens of the stone age change,"catchy, orginal, and good. It is definatly hard to follow songs for the deaf and i like the fact where they changed this album. Good tracks are: this lullaby, medication, tangled up in plaid,in my head, little sister, thats a killer scene there. My favorite tracks are: everybody knows that youre insane, Burn the witch, and my absolute favorite someones in the wolf.IT IS A GREAT album but i only gave it 3 stars which it should actully get 4 stars but whatever it is good."
15871,0,Very mediocre compared to previous albums.,"I've been a fan of QotSA for a few years now. They're a very good band that I feel have never gotten the respect they fully deserve. However, I will tell you right now that this album isn't that great. It's not bad, but it's just not nearly as good as their previous albums. It has it's moments, but previous albums have had so much more. If you're really looking to get into this band I suggest that you check out their older releases (Beaver EP and self-titled LP), for I feel QotSA were at their best during this time. Rated-R is also a good album, but Songs for the Deaf (3rd album) is even better. So basically it comes down to this: albums 1 and 3 are amazing; 2nd album is very good; 4th album is simply mediocre in comparison."
15873,0,"At first I was ""What the $@#%?"" now it's growing on me","Definitely an album you need to work with. Not much is going to reach right out and grab you off the bat. Definitely a ""headphone"" kind of album. You need repeated listens to really grasp a lot of what is going on. There's actually some really neat, dare I say pretty, things going on. But it definitely lacks the chaos and aggression of a Nick O. project. Very simliar to the Rated R album IMO. Some tunes are straight up QOTSA, but some of the songs just don't go anywhere. You're waiting for something to happen and nothing is resolved. For now it's at the bottom of my QOTSA pile. That may change..................."
15876,0,An interesting book,"Certainly interesting and worthwhile, but if you want to read much of the same themes, with a broader biological perspective and without the preachiness and impractical political solutions, I recommend instead Happiness by Daniel Nettles."
15879,0,Locking Fuel Cap,"Someone stole my gas cap on my car, so I shopped around for a cap that would be harder to steal. I found the locking fuel caps, and this one seemed to have good reviews, was a reasonable price, and fit my car, so I got it. It works fine so far for the most part (hasn't been stolen if nothing else), but a word to the wise, if you buy this cap, (and possibly others like it), it is really hard to open when you need to put gas in your car. I've spent the last few times looking like an idiot trying to open my own gas tank, taking like 5mins to finally get it open. Least I know no one can steal it again if I can't even open it. Practice with it first, a lot, so you can open it properly. I don't know if it is designed to be hard to open with a key on purpose or not."

15894,0,Wonderful for storage!,"I have theSony DCR-DVD105 DVD Handycam Camcorder with 20x Optical Zoom. The camera is light, easy to use, and a great camera. This bag handily stores the camera and at least an extra battery. A few discs (without cases) are able to fit as well. Which, in my opinion, is a strong drawback. If there was more, or even slightly bigger pockets on the side or under the hood of the bag, it would be a lot better and easier to keep things at your finger tips. Maybe some slots for the unused discs on the inside (like a visor CD holder for your car)But for the basic keeping of the video camera hand and within easy reach and protection, which is all you really need, this bag is wonderful."
15913,0,Good Stuff,"This is the classic of the classic noir movies. It's not particularly great and you don't wish that you could do a movie like it, but you will enjoy yourself as you watch the protagonist go from a hopeful shlub to a complete loser. Nothing goes right for this guy and I mean nothing, but the femme fatale is great."
15915,0,great music!--poor sound!,"""reflections"" by julius hemphill et al is great,wonderful music----but my copy of this album (published by ""freedom"") has very serious technical sound problems with at least one of the pieces---on ""the hard blues"", a wonderfully funky & vibrant repeating line is continually botched in sound editing everytime it recurrs: voices are dropped out or muffled & the stereo mix is always screwed up----granted, this is on only one track, & in only one (repeated) section of this track----but it is the best, or most dynamic piece on the album & the extremely distorted passages really marr the enjoyment of the whole piece---unless ""freedom"" gets it's act together & corrects this dub problem (not on the originals), i'd recommend most customers stay away from this particular re-issue, unless they dont mind listening to classic music getting mangled---especially considering the high prices that are being charged for this very defective item."
15920,0,Hope this works....,I have gotten so much use out of this B&D 12v drill and then all of a sudden the batteries are not charging. Can only assume its the charger so I am buying another one. Can't figure why it just died for no reason though!
15921,0,A Not-So-Well-Known-Event-In-History brought to life,"I have been searching for books on the early history of Canada, and this was one of the few I have found that is, #1, still in print, and #2, about a specific event. Most of the history of Canada books I have found are very general, and give overviews of events, instead of getting really involved in a particular period or geographic area. Although this is a bit text-bookish in parts and can move slowly, it is jam packed with information, which is what I wanted. I loved Faraghers DANIEL BOONE, and found that to be much more ""readable."""
15924,0,"Good Tone, Clogs Badly","A fine tone for the price, as well as quality construction and fit. The simulated wood-grain finish is also attractive. It comes with a rugged cloth zip case, fingering chart, cleaning rod, and tiny container of recorder cream (a lubricant for fitting the recorder's three sections together). A plastic thumb rest, sold separately, is recommended to help balance the instrument while playing.The one major downside to this recorder is that the windway clogs often and easily, a virtually nonexistent problem with my Aulos plastic sopranino and Hohner wood soprano."
15925,0,Why did Warner issue this in Pan n' Scan ?,"This is by far my favorite Chuck Norris movie--- he's a Hitman and one mean dude.Too bad it's full-frame only, it was originally a widescreen release and as I remember, it uses the full frame.And dvdtown.com calls the video ""fuzzy"".How could Warner do this ? Somebody over there knows better because they put out a lot of great stuff, like the Noir collections.Why put out a sub-standard dvd ?"
15927,0,This movie is for kids,"I'd just like to say that while I didn't think this movie rated very high, my daughter, who saw it the first time when she was 7 1/2 is crazy about this movie and since that who I bought it for, I am happy she likes it!"
15930,0,Okay...but disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with this burp cloth. They are smaller than I expected (a little bigger than a wash cloth), and while I have washed them, the fabric itself is not soft. They are not ""bad"" by any means. I plan to use them and hope they will be absorbent and adequate. However, I would not recommend them as a favorite baby product, or purchase them to give as a gift."
15938,0,A Collection that Eventually Comes Around,"I bought this book because it's always interesting to see what type of literary fiction psychoanalysts come up with. I wasn't too impressed with the first half of the collection. I found the characters rather dull and flat and the dialog a bit forced (""Love is Not a Pie"" is the exception). For example, ""Song of Solomon"" is awful -- don't bother reading it. However, ""Silver Water"" in the Three Stories section is beautifully written, very realistic, and hits you exactly where a story of this nature should. As the collection progresses, the writing and weaving of Amy Bloom's stories get better. Skip the first section and this book is a delight."
15940,0,Two Enjoyable Episodes!,"While not outstanding episodes, both these stories are very entertaining. I'm not sure, but believe at least some of the shots in the first were taken on board the Queen Mary which is permanently docked in Long Beach, CA. It's always good to see Leslie Nielsen and I kept waiting for him to do something funny but the role was strictly serious. Instead, Jo Anne Worley (Laugh-In) and Vicki Lawrence (Carol Burnett Show) were the silly ones. The second story teamed Jessica once again with Harry McGraw played by the wonderful Jerry Orbach."

15970,0,Heavily illustrated? Nope,"Alan Moore has serious chops when it comes to writing for comics. This brief comic-sized primer tops out at about 50 pages and most of the piece is over twenty-five years old. In his 5-page 'Afterwords' (now almost a decade old itself), Moore says he thinks he did a pretty good job but admits his viewpoint is dated and that he'd offer a new perspective if he were to do a new article on writing for comics. Is it worth it? It is if you are a fan of Alan Moore. It's especially worth it if you buy it at less than cover price -- Amazon currently has the title available for about two bucks.Don't expect to see a ""heavily illustrated"" article, however, despite the publisher's promise. Every two or three pages, you'll find a single, rather small b&w; illustration that brings nothing new to the words around it. The illustrations are adequately done but nothing spectacular."
15973,0,A good test prep tool,"I found the book to be helpful in preparing for the format and the content (to an extent) of the test. I found the practice tests both in the book and with the CD to be very helpful. I did not have any problems with the software. The vocabulary words were not as helpful as I had hoped but the 'tricks' provided to analyze words even when you don't know them really helped me to get the score I needed the first time taking the test. Of course I did not see any exact questions or math problems on the test as in the practice, but the examples provided helped enough to solve most of them. The key is actually going through and doing the practice problems and understanding the concept of them. KNOW THE VOCABULARY and probably get additional words from another source prior to taking your GRE."
15979,0,Best Modem better than imac internal modem,"I bought the Best Data 56USBPMAC modem from my local Mac Store after having a lot of trouble with my imac flat panel internal modem (apparently the internal modem couldn't handle phone line noise).The connection speed increased dramatically, from 27000 at best (sometimes the internal modem slowed down to 900) to over 42000. However, after a few days I started getting the error message that the modem could not be found, or the never-ending disconnect. I eventually discovered that after my computer had gone to sleep, I saw a light on the modem with the letter OH. I don't know what that meant, except perhaps ""on-hold""? Anyway, I've tried reconnecting the USB plug into the back of the computer after the computer has been sleeping and before trying to connect, and that seems to have solved the problem.That is a bit of a nuisance, but still tons better than the frustration with the internal modem disconnects and slow speed."
15980,0,Good Modem When It Works,"The internal modem in my iMac died so I bought this one. Very simple to set up. But there seems to be an intermittant bug in the modem's software that causes problems with my computer (which is running OS 10.2.8). Without warning, the computer won't recognize the modem and I'll have to continually fiddle with iMac's network and modem settings.Other times, when I disconnect from being online, the computer will hang in the disconnect mode and look like it's in the process of disconnecting even though it's no longer online. When this happens the only solution I've found is to reboot my computer, which is a pain.Repeated emails and faxes to Best Data tech support have resulted in a total of zero responses from the company, so if tech support is important to you, avoid this modem."
15984,0,"Great table, train set leaves something to be desired.","We really like this table. The train portion of the table has a good picture. You can flip the boards to plain wood--we've done that to convert to a lego/art table. The drawers underneath, when full of trains etc., are too heavy for the slats and will fall. Then again, we have a lot of train track. The track and trains/toys that come with this set were not up to par. The mountain is cheap and some real Thomas trains have trouble going through. Our airport didn't come with screws (and I'm sure KidKraft would have sent new ones, but we didn't take the time). The bridge, gas station, helicopter, and crane broke within six months. We didn't mind too much since we had other stuff to replace it with, but if this were my only set, I would have been disappointed. The trains were really cheap.So, the table/is still great. The track works. We like it overall, but then there's all that other stuff to consider."
15986,0,Needs more illustration,"First let me say, I never write reviews for anything; but this product has frustrated me so much that I had to say something. Putting this together on Christmas Eve was awful! There were no good pictures to help you through putting the track together and we found two errors in the instructions. Putting the table together was a breeze, it was just the track that is so complicating. Also, from what I can tell in just the few minutes that we have had it together; the train is no good. It derails all the time and I am sure that my little guy is going to get frustrated with it pretty quickly; I hope I am wrong. I will post more after a bit more use....just had to say something about the track itself."
15994,0,Fair for both Almodovar and Sakamoto,"Liked the film. ALmodovar was experimenting with styled-up Douglas Sirk melodrama, and Marisa Paredes is always great to watch. The score served the film well, but becomes a bit redundant on record. One main theme gets played over and over in many treatments long and short. It's a sad, mournful piece, quite pretty, but I wish Sakamoto had developed some additional themes for the other characters. The pop cuts by Spanish singers are great, especially ""Un Ano de Amor"" which had Miguel Bose in drag in the film singing a 60s-styled love-anthem that is quite catchy . Not Almodovar's best film by a long shot, though, and certainly not Sakamoto's best outing as a film composer."
15996,0,"Wow What a Tire! Comfort, Speed, Lightweight...Not Durable!","I bought a pair of Open Corsas and they were heaven for 200 miles, then the rear picked up a small shard, it looked like a small flake from the aggregate in asphalt.After two more rides, the split in the tread deepened and the tire blew out.I conclude these would be 5 star racing tires, but I'm not a racer and don't like their lack of durability. The ride they give is awesome, they corner like a dream and stick to the pavement. I just won't buy them again (sigh).One more thing; don't let them sit in a car during summer with full pressure. Both blew the tubes. Let out about 30 pounds."
15997,0,A love/hate relationship.,"Combined with Michelin Latex tubes, this tire effectively diffuses road vibrations to a mere, slight tremor, while navigating the roughest of roads. On flats, they roll so fast and smooth...it feels exactly like gliding on marble, at 80psi. The turning confidence, high-speed ease and sheer downhill velocity you can achieve will drop your jaws in utter disbelief. However, these tires' sublime rolling resistance and dreamy ride quality will all soon come to a rude, abrupt end, as you experience the inevitable, true-life reality of absolutely ZERO FLAT PROTECTION.I only bought them to see what all the hype was about, and simply because you only live ONCE. When these tires are done...I won't be buying them TWICE. I'll go back to the Schwalbe Ultremo R.1 - which is lighter, and is about 90% close to the CX...but with far superior durability and puncture resistance."
15998,0,Outdated but has value as time capsule,"I bought this because it has brief treatments of combinatory logic and the lambda calculus. I was dissapointed, however, because of the rather idiosyncratic notation; I had to go back and start nearly from the beginning to see how he was developing his formal systems. I've had logic, so I felt that it was inconvenient to have to read chapters just to get a handle on his notation and outlook. When I did finally arive at the sections on combinators and lambda, the treatment was too superficial to be a benefit. Should've just bought Hindley.The problems stated, I found the author's discussion of early research informative and interesting. This book was written before an interpretation was formally defined in Tarski (1956), so the different research directions to escape this problem I thought were neat. There is much discussion about purely syntactical systems vs. systems where semantics are defined."

The copy I have is a 1958 co. The words are easy so that it can be read by very early elementary aged children or to preschoolers.The story also presents a situation that a child of this age can relate to: namely not being able to play outside because of weather. Peter wakes up to find it raining . ""Old bad rain,"" he growls. He can't do any of the fun stuff when it rains. Mother sees he is frowning when he comes to breakfast and she inquires about this. ""I am sorry you do not like the rain. The rain helped you to have good juice."" The rest of the book tells what a blessing the rain really is because of what all God does with rain. In the end Peter is glad that it rains, even when he can not ride his tricycle."

16019,0,There Are Better Condoms!,"Both my girlfriend and I felt that these were fairly good condoms, esp. considering the price (about 16.5 cents each). They aren't as sensitive, for either of us, as other condoms we have used. We've been using Lifestyles ULTRA THIN condoms for several years now, after a lot of trial and error (tough job), and nothing compares. Plus, you can get the Lifestyles for about 12 cents each.

16037,0,He's done better,"The story, such as it is, tells of the migration of the group formerly known as Calahan's from Long Island to Key West and what happened after.There's very little to the story. While it was quite readable, I found it contrived compared to his other work. Basically, everything which happens after they settle in at Key West could have been cut with an over-all gain to the resulting story. I'm still curious about what happens next, though.It's worth buying if you're really ""into"" the Calahan's Bar stories or you really like Spider Robinson's work. Otherwise, try his other stuff instead."
16044,0,not bad...........,"This wasn't actaully a horrible game, but it wasn't the best one i have ever played before. In zoo tycoon, you have to build a zoo, and make it so that lots of people come, and the animals and people are happy. It was hard for me to keep all of the animals happy when my zoo got bigger, because i had to make sure all of these other animals were happy first. At times you have to check in with your visitors to see how much they like the zoo. Usually they will have some problem for you to solve by buying something- like more bathrooms or garbage cans. So, all in all, this wasnt a horrible game, but it could have been better."
16046,0,Don't Feed the Animals...,"Zoo Tycoon tries its best to capitalize on the whole ""Tycoon"" genre. But dialogs and settings are somewhat confusing, and keeping your animals happy is a full time challenge. (Just wait until you try to get past the Endangered Cats scenario.) But overall this game is a good addition to anyones tycoon/simulation collection....expecially if you've always wanted to run your own animal park."
16047,0,This tycoon hits the big one.,"I am a kid but I get all great grades and know how to rate games. Zoo Tycoon is fun to fool around with. The graphics are good and you can easily access info. about your animals. My only problem is that after playing for a while, it isn't fun anymore. You already constructed a few exibits and there isn't much more to do. Your animals escape a few times and it starts to seem get boring just watching animals. Zoo Tycoon is a good game to borrow from a friend but I wouldn't really buy it."

16058,0,"Good on games, lacking on the rest","I was disappointed in this book. It becomes clear as you read it that it is written for an audience already familiar with the author's Project Adventure. Unfortunately this isn't made clear on the back cover or anywhere else. The first chapter advises telling the group about The Experiental Learning Curve, The Full Value Contract, and Challenge by Choice - but none of these are covered at all in this book - and worse still, the book doesn't even refer one to where one COULD find out about them, beyond a brief mention of another book (""Youth Leadership in Action"") on the last page of the book. Also, if you have a basic knowledge of leading experiential learning, then you will not learn anything from the irritatingly chatty introductory chapters of this book. Buy this book based on the games only."
16061,0,OK book for those totally new to Amharic,"I bought this book with me the first time I ever went to Ethiopia. It actually wasn't very helpful to me in helping me speak Amharic and there were a lot of mistakes that were pointed out to me in the book. However the fact that the words are also written out in Amharic are most helpful because you can always point to the word if you have trouble and someone will be willing to help you pronunciate the correct word in Amharic. If you want to learn some very basic words then this book is good. However if you want to speak phrases or sentences, that book does not exist just yet. This book also does a good job of telling basic facts about the culture which was very helpful to me during my first trip to Ethiopia. Overall I'd say that it is a good book and was well worth my money. I would say that others also enjoyed this book because when I left Ethiopia I could not find my book ;-)"
16063,0,Kind of fun.,"This is a feel good story about a whole bunch of small town characters told in short rapid fire chapters. There is nothing special about the plot, and the characters certainly aren't deeply drawn. As light reading, I kind of liked the book. The characters are often fun, sometimes fresh, and it is fun how so many of the characters will appear, exit, and then re-appear some time later. It is multi-generational, and ranges over the entire middle class, even upper lower class! The book isn't mawkish, and fails only when attempting to meaningfully depict personality change (one partial exception being a lonely woman who meets her man). Let me confess that I stopped reading the biblical quotes which begin each chapter, and perhaps I did not properly appreciate the deeper significance of the work and its themes of salvation and redemption."

In the second instance, the set is described as having a raised heel pad. There is no raised heel pad. Unfortunately, because I live outside the US, the cost of returning this would be so prohibitive that I simply won't bother. This probably won't make a difference anyway, because this item is out of stock and they'll probably remove it from their inventory along with my review.If it were properly described, it is actually not a bad carpet mat and I still may have considered it at that price.

16078,0,More about starting a business than about consulting,"A well written book with lots of knowledge, good ideas and motivation. A lot of the info here, however, is applicable to starting any kind of business in the knowledge / info management industry, and it has been done better elsewhere. There is not much here on what a consultant actually does, what kind of tools consultants can use to do their jobs, how you can learn to translate the knowledge you currently posses into a consulting career, what you will do when you land your first client, and so on. The book is certainly helpful on some fronts, but it is not enough to get you started as a consultant.So, not a bad product, but the title is misleading and if you are looking for a single source that will explain the field of consulting, look elsewhere."
16079,0,Awesome content almost overcomes NASA marketing,"I saw ""For All Mankind"" in its IMAX incarnation at the Smithsonian. I hate to be a party pooper, but it struck me as more a NASA marketing piece than the awesome piece of space trip I had expected. Admittedly, I am biassed, having seen Spaceborne many years ago. The latter was a short assembled from public-domain footage, and had a much more spontaneous, closer-to-the-moment feeling than ""For All Mankind"". Still, space footage is space footage: hard to screw it up, especially with a score by Brian Eno. If only Criterion had included Spaceborne (otherwise unavailable) on this disk."
16080,0,Looks more like a lavish promo for NASA than a documentary,"I guess it depends on how much footage of the Apollo missions you want to watch, but you get decidedly more viewing pleasure for the buck with the HBO series, From the Earth to the Moon - The Signature Edition, which also had unlimited access to NASA in making this documentary -- 720 minutes as opposed to 79 minutes plus whatever extras Criterion tossed in. For All Mankind is visually appealling but it doesn't give you anywhere near the depth of information that the HBO series provides, plus it loses much of its appeal on the small screen."
16081,0,Space Nerd History,"The Apollo program through the cameras the astronauts took with them, as well as through cameras in the control room at Houston. It's interesting, but in the process of finding a picture of the DVD cover, I came across another I'm going to have to find, called ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" from 2007 directed by Ron Howard. I suspect (especially from the trailer) that it is going to be better.This is mostly the raw film, with all its flaws, and you don't always know what you are looking at. Indeed, I spent a good bit of the time while they were on the moon trying to figure where the camera was that was taking the picture. It turns out they have mashed together several trips, and so while there were only two astronauts on the surface in Apollo 8 (or was that 9?), there were more later, and there were cameras on the rover (which trip had the rover and went up to a ridge at a considerable distance from the lander?), and all together this was pretty confusing. Interesting, but confusing."
16083,0,Not great for noise cancelling,"I bought it for a long plane trip. It seems noise cancelling headphones are great at reducing lower frequency noises. With the headphone, the roar of the jet engine is reduced, however, it reveals the annoying shrike of the wind noise which otherwise would be drowned out by the engine noise.The headphone make music sound fantastic. But, that wasn't why I bought it.I've had it for almost a year and after the first month I never used again.The setup is fairly cumbersome. It is not easy to sleep while using it since the wires and battery pack get in the way.I've found that a good pair of earplugs works better."
16084,0,Bulky battery case is a bigger problem for me than illustrated by most review,I need to emphasize that the battery case really is a nuisance. So much so that I never use this headset when on the move and even sitting here in my office every time I turn or reach for something it comes skating across the desk or crashes to the ground.
16089,0,"Stick with Bose, these are more compact but not impressive","I've been using the Bose Quiet II headphones for about three years. They are pretty good but after a while on a plane you feel like your brains are being sucked out of your head from the suction and if you fall asleep on the plane and roll your head you are reminded that they are on. Additionally they take up a lot of space to carry in its case. Soooo, I bought a pair of the Sennheiser PXC 300 headphones after reading the reviews. One thing is true, they do take up less space in their case. They don't, however, do as good a job cancelling out the noise. I found myself holding the ear pieces close to my ears to make it easier to hear over the engine noise. It was nice not having the suction feeling of an over the ears headphone but I got them for noise cancelling and they really didn't work very well."
16103,0,okay,"This is a good novel. There really isn't much in the plot. It's more of a character study. The book focuses on Pat, an aging rent owner and his difficulties with renting in a ghetto and his nagging family. The family includes colorful characters like Marty, the obsessive lawyer and especially Harry, a beach bum into all of these New Age type things. The main reason to read this book though is for the relationship between Reggie and Pat, which doesn't try to be sentimental but is touching anyway."
16106,0,Not the Best Pieper book to Read,"It is unclear whether it is the German or the English translation that is at fault here, but if you are interested in reading Pieper, you may want to start somewhere else. Pieper is someone I enjoy immensely. He is very readable, is good at making concepts easy to digest, and tends to be very accessible for some who wants to get their feet wet in Thomistic philosophy. This volume was the opposite in every respect.The translator's introduction would lead the reader to believe that he a number of liberties in translating. It is unclear whether the translator committed sabotage, but the English is cumbersome and many of the sentences go on for several lines. It takes the skill of an investigative journalist and logistician to decifer some of the passages.I have enjoyed other works by Pieper translated by Richard and Clara Winston, Sister Mary Francis McCarty, and Lothar Krauth. Two personal favorites are LIESURE THE BASIS OF CULTURE and HAPPINESS AND CONTEMPLATION."
16119,0,Questionable as a Booster,"This has been a good seat for my son since he was 12 mos. He's now 4, 44 lbs & 43"" tall. The manual claims the seat can be used on a child <52"" height, but my son has very little to go until the back of the seat meets the top of his ears, the limit according to the manufacturer as outlined in the instruction manual. I wonder what child at 52"" would properly fit in this seat if mine at 43"" has nearly outgrown it? Beware of this seat's claim to be the only one you'll ever need."
16129,0,Not Enough Bang,"The film itself is only a compilation of scenes which have no inherent meaning to someone living outside of Russia. I won't deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at the time (filmed 1928) but the problem with the film is that it has no interest to the intellectual or common man. We are merely watching an arranged form of pictures, ranging from a one arm man beating a horse, to a toothless soldier in the war. Everything in between is awkward, haphazard and quite unnecessary. It would have been possible to invent a forum which kept the viewer interested but this would not be it although the method of the director is quite brilliant. In all, one should view this if they are an art student or a student of pre-Tarkovskian cinema."
16139,0,hmmmm,"perhaps she is forgetting that the past 200 years are not the sum total of human history. is there a battle between the sexes in ""primitive"" cultures on earth today? she is looking at a one hundred year period as if it's much more important than the 25,000 years humans have existed. not very impressive from an anthropological standpoint, in fact, pretty short-sighted. anyone who agrees with me.... read Ishmael and My Ishmael by Daniel Quinn."
16140,0,Imaginary portrait of Furboy the goat beast,"Because I love Diane Arbus's photographs I hoped this film would be good. It was just OK. It was not about Diane Arbus as an artist much. That is too bad. I wanted a film about her as an emerging artist and all I got was a film about her falling in love with the dog boy from The Shining. Not bad, not good. 50%. !/2 & 1/2. Pollock and Basquiat were more along the lines of what I was hoping for. Oh well. Odd film."
16149,0,A bit too impressionistic,"This biography is a must-read simply because it is by Sandburg and thus a thread of the national literary fabric. However, Sandburg tends to fictionalize or fill in the blanks of Lincoln's boyhood to the point where it sometimes becomes embarrassing. The narrative picks up speed and credibility, however, when it gets to the documented period of Lincoln's life; and ironically, the folksiness now works in its favor by evoking a very human and real portrait of Lincoln, unlike the current revisionist history drivel about his being gay, manic-depressive, or pro-slavery."
16152,0,Good clasp not the best but works.,Good item as a decorative clasp. As a security device not so much. It breaks with a few good hits. If all you are looking for is something decorative this is what you want. As for security and not looks buy another clasp.
16157,0,"""Dance of the Giants"" could be bigger.","This was much better than the first in the series, ""The Peril at Delphi"", but here's the thing: you must read all of these Indy books in the order they were written - at least as far as Rob MacGregor's titles go. They definitely follow a storyline.""The Dance of the Giants"" refers to Stonehenge, which is actually linked to Delphi (according to MacGregor), and both linked to Merlin the Magician. MacGregor does a good job joining the two stories together, but it seems two separate books were unnecessary; they could've been one whole novel. Then again, I can't blame the guy (or Lucasfilm for that matter) for wanting to sell more books."
16159,0,An ok book,The book is detailed but too general. Easy to understand but not in depth enough for understanding more advanced concept. The price is more than it worth

16166,0,Pick a star aka movie struck,"Well, I bought this movie to add it to my Laurel & Hardy collection...however this is in no way a Laurel & Hardy film. They make a cameo in this movie really. The movie overall wasn't bad. It was actually a pretty decent film about a girl dying to make it in Hollywood. I wouldn't recommend this movie to a Laurel & Hardy fan but if you like old movie classics you will probably enjoy this one."

16175,0,Disappointing,"I've loved the Pat Metheny Group since my father played their CD's for me as a kid, and there was always something evocative about how they played. As I grew older, I also learned to appreciate the musical intricacies that Pat Metheny and pianist Lyle Mays can create when they compose together. This album, however, features less creativity or technical prowess than I would have liked, devolving into almost New Age music at times. Metheny and Mays have so much more talent than they let on here, and it's a shame that they released an album this boring. If you want an introduction to the Pat Metheny Group, I suggest you look elsewhere."
16177,0,Great price but scratches easy,"This sink looks really good but it scratches very easily, because the surface is not made of smooth material, water spots shows up as part of the sink unless you constantly wipe it. The material is not right for kitchen sink. I suppose it's OK for light duty use such as a wet bar where look is more important than function. Other better quality scratch resistant black sinks cost a lot more, I would have given it two stars if it wasn't for the good price."
16178,0,Marginal effort with a couple of highlights,"It's hard to go wrong with Maceo, Fred and a Hammond B3. But while this album doesn't disappoint it doesn't inspire, either. The production is slick, there's a couple of hired studio guns on hand, and it all sounds a little mailed in for my liking. No sweaty, gut-bucket funk here. Downloading ""The Chicken"" and ""Southwick"" from iTunes is probably all you need."

Although this one is a little slower, and it never did entertain me, the rest of the series is great. The whole Wee Sing collection should be a part of every family, or else you're missing out. (I should know, I actually started a ""Wee Sing fansite"" -- try to find it!) And I still think that Wee Sing is the best."

And when the basket is locked onto the base, the whole combi is easy to be turned over because of the long base and basket weight. It should be better if your car has a LATCH, which offers a second position to fix the base, and of course, avoid the turn-over.(b) Not easy to take the basket out of base. I usually have to try 2 or 3 times."
16193,0,The 2nd Best Gellhorn Biography,"This is a nice complement to authorized biography of Gellhorn by Caroline Moorehead. The author goes over the same ground, but in much less detail and without access to most of Gellhorn's letters or private diaries. However, ""Beautiful Exile"" contains some needed analysis and criticism of Gellhorn which was solely lacking in the Moorehead book.A definite minus is an error filled appendix and Rollyson's pedestrian prose style.Probably best for Gellhorn fans who've read the Morehead biography and want a different perspective."

16219,0,Certainly Not Walt's Shining Moment . . .,"Forget what critics have been pounding about ""The Sword in the Stone"" and ""The Black Cauldron"" being Disney's least distinguished animated features. ""Robin Hood"" takes the cake (or gold?) as far as mediocrity is concerned. It starts off well enough but never sustains any significant emotion- our sympathies don't lie with the hero (depicted himself as rather shallow and bland) but with the villain, the only joy in the entire film. One part of the film is lifted directly from Snow White (and the attempts to hide this show!); the music is forgettable and Little John is a direct reprisal of Baloo from ""The Jungle Book"". Few of the voice performances are worth mentioning and the animation itself is not even good for the 70s (and this is a Disney film!) If you collect Disney films, buy it and you'll watch it once. If you don't, skip this one by and seek out the live-action Disney feature."
16222,0,First Donkey Kong without Mario,"This is a fun game. That being said it is also a very limited game. Even for the time it does not offer variety. You'll end up playing this game for a few minutes before you will inevitably think, ""Is that all?"" The ""levels"" are almost identical. The game has no ending. You will ultimately be left unsatisfied from playing this title.Note: one of my ""overall"" stars comes solely from the ""Donkey Kong"" name."
16234,0,"Great, but a few catches.","BGO has been wonderful about releasing all Johnny Rivers' LPs in 2-for-1 style. This was a surprise to see released, and a welcome one too, but a few things should be noted.""And I Know You Wanna Dance"" is in MONO, for some reason the stereo tapes were not used, and ""Revisited"" masters were obviously in rough shape as there are warbles and drop-outs throughout that section of the CD. Large booklet enclosed, but nothing in detail about these 2 albums, more of a JR bio.The CD came with a wrap around it, simply the CD artwork, same as on the inserts. Perhaps they could have skipped this and lowered the price of the CD a bit more, accordingly.Minor complaints aside...I'm still thrilled to have it in my collection."

But out of the box they need work."
16244,0,awesome writer ... blah storyline,John Steinbeck is incredible at giving vivid pictures through using words.I felt like a watched a movie from reading this book.the story never really goes anywhere and its a short read.i guess when u read a steinbeck novel you need to focus on the symbolisms and analogies rather than the actual stories.
16245,0,My Review,I think this was a pretty good book. It would have been a lot better if it wouldn't have changed main characters so much. I like books that only have a few main characters. I didn't understand the the plot to the story. there was no meaning to the story it was just a small town that loves to throw parties. The only problem is that no one has any money.
16247,0,timo's review,I think the book is pretty good. I like most about it that steinbeck describes the characters very good . I don't like that every chapter has to do wth something else. for example from doc's 2nd surprise party to the gopher who trys to find a new home. i lke that the story is in realism and deals with real situations. while you read the book you kind of move into montery and see the daily life of the people and their feelings.timo
16254,0,The book I love Cannery Row By Steinbeck.,"Cannery Row is just a few blocks long. Within its limits are sardine fisheries which give the Row its name. The story that builds up around this area and the memorable characters who inbabit it is suffused with warmth,understanding,and a great grasp of human values."
16264,0,Not as good as the rest of his books,"As much as I like other Reverte's books, I was tempted more than once to close this book without finishing it. Somehow I got to the page 160, and then all Reverte's magic was back, and I was glad that I did not put the book down. The main drawback for me was that the plot was relatively easy predictable, as compared to the other novels of Arturo Perez-Reverte. Also, my timing was not so good - after all Dan Brown buzz any book that begins in Vatican gets from me an immediate ""not again"" response. Anyway, Reverte's ability to weave together history, romance, philosophy and suspense still creates magic, despite not-so-fascinating plot and one-dimensional characters. And... now I'd really like to visit Ceville."
16270,0,Mystery and mild philosophy set against a boring plot,"I read this book in a rather odd manner. I skipped most of the sections dealing with the shady business dealings of Macarena's husband and concentrated instead on the relationships between Father Quart, Macarena, the dead Carlotta, etc. The mystery was satisfying enough, and the passage in which the murderer was revealed was strikingly visual. If Mr. Macarena had anything to do with the mystery, I didn't miss it. For this reason I had to give the book just 3 stars.I found the comparisons between Reverte and Eco interesting. On my last trip to the bookstore I picked up the Club Dumas and the Name of the Rose b/c I found the blurbs on the back of the books to be similar in tone (this was prior to reading these reviews). I'm half way through the Name of the Rose, but I don't find any similarities in style, just perhaps in themes."
16271,0,Not as good as the other two,"Father Quart is memorable, and the book is decent, but a disappointment after the Flanders Panel and the Club Dumas"
16274,0,"very nice, but a little standard","i would have to say that only about 25% of the images in this book really stand out. the other 75% remind me of anything a person could shoot with any camera. other than that the photographers chose nice looking models and photographed them well. a good coffee table book, but lacks everywhere else."
16278,0,Heart of a Jaguar - cool or fool?,"The book Heart of a Jaguar was remarkable, chilling, and fascinating. It really teaches a lot about the Mayas, while giving you a compelling read. It has a surprise ending, (...). Although the book is an excellent read, it also makes you cry and have a reason to be scared. Also, if you haven’t read anything about the Mayas, you may be very grossed out.This book contains many of the rituals the Mayas did, and it really makes you feel like you’re right there. If you wish for a nice, sweet novel for reading all curled up in your bed, this is not your book. If you wish for a story that will make you cry for your mommy, and have nightmares if you read it at night, this is the book for you!"
16298,0,Torin's Book Review,"The New Horse EncyclopediaThe New Horse Encyclopedia is your average encyclopedia. With facts diagrams, photos and all that jazz. You can find anything in there that you need to know. I'm not saying it's fun to read but it is easy to understand and it is quick and decisive in telling you stuff you need or want to know about horses. If you don't mind reading facts and if you don't know much about horses than this is the book for you. If you don't like reading facts than don't pick up this book."
16299,0,Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes,I do not remember most of the nursery rhymes. The ones I do remember are incomplete. It is a good book to start out with nursery rhymes.
16301,0,Borrow it from the library,"This is a book you could live without. The really good part of it is the instructions part, where she shows how to make stitches and what they look like, and what you can do with them without a pattern. Ms. Stoller thinks she's really clever by putting in section headings using phrases that allude to pop culture and/or things that are inappropriate, but it's just tacky; and in all reality, classiness is free and doesn't make people sick or feel sorry for you.But, most of the patterns are obnoxious. A crocheted cowboy hat? Ipod animals? Crocheted flower brooches? Goodness, is she THAT desperate for patterns?There were a few good patterns in the book, though the models are really dorky. I have made one of the projects so far, and there may be about three more that I make in the time to come."
16302,0,"Great Basics, Terrible past that","I got this book for Christmas and sped through the first portion. I learned the basics really easily, the book was laid out very conveniently and other than a few less than clear phrases it was great! But past the basics it didn't help me much at all, the only patterns I've tried have ended up with me tangled in knots and to frustrated to continue. I have taken the skills I learned and applied them to patterns elsewhere really easily and have had wonderful success. Enjoyed learning crochet very much and now love crochet especially amigurumi!"
16306,0,So So,"Overall, I like this book. It's nicely organized, has good visuals, some good ideas...I give three stars for effort. However, I just can't stand the language used in this book. It's just too corny like they're trying to dumb down to a 10 year old. The patterns are also so-so---nothing special for all the hype this series has received. Props for trying to be hip, but it's ""hip"" in a Nickelodeon sort of way, very cliched teenager stuff with skulls and all."
16308,0,Way too many errors,"I'm glad I checked this book out of the library before parting with my hard-earned cash. As with the majority of crochet books, there is little here for anyone with experience. Almost half the book is taken up with basic stuff that I really don't need to see (or pay for) in EVERY book of patterns, and most of the items are a tad on the young side for me. However, I don't expect all books to be written according to my personal taste, so with that said:At first glance, it appears pretty good for beginners, but closer inspection reveals a huge number of mistakes that's likely to deter a lot of newbies from persevering. After all, in my experience, those new to the fabulous craft of crochet don't know about errata addenda. Basic information, e.g., whether the turning chain counts as a stitch, is missing, and stitch counts are incorrect on at least two of the patterns. This is what really lets it down. It's a pity because I like to see books that make learning crochet fun."
16309,0,Missing directions,"Ther are pattern errors in this book. All of the corrections can be found on line, but I think they need a new editor. The fingerless gloves are missing several rows. The pattern didn't turn out right. Other than errors, it is a good book. Just Google the pattern for corrections before you start."
16310,0,Good and Bad...,"Okay so I admit, I have actually read all four of Debbie Stoller's major books. I really appreciate how clear her instructions are and how well she explains the technique for beginners. My objection is not to the writing but to the language. Why is it at all appropriate to use a word like B**** in the title of the series? I cannot use these books to teach most anyone (though I got them in College) because the foul language is embarassing. I cannot use them with Children or with the people who want to learn through the church for really obvious reasons. This language may be okay in Ms. Stoller's little universe but not in mine. If not for the unfortunate language and crude jokes, I would recommend them heartily... Unfortunately, she does not consider that her audience may find such things even slightly inappropriate. Her loss. I will not buy any more of her books or recommend them to students or friends."
16316,0,Forget about the man; contemplate the message,"Either Krishnamurti's ""message"" is true or it is not. Why do we care about the man himself? Krishnamurti himself urged us not to consider him a guru or focus on his ""legacy"". Regardless of what personal behavior he engaged in, one must determine for oneself if the words he spoke through the course of his life were simply words, or the reflection of a ""reality"" that is independent of our need to connect the image of a man to some potentially deeper truth. Maybe everything he said was pure fantasy, not applicable to the human condition. But that judgement has nothing to do with any new evidence that may or may not come to light with regard to Krishnamurti's personal behavior. Let's just all try to figure it out for ourselves and not be too quick to put anyone on a pedestal nor cast him/her down."
16322,0,"Sorry, not for me","This is our reading group's March selection--otherwise, I'd not have stayed with it. It simply seemed too contrived, from the names (Whippy Bird, Effa Commander--always use the whole name!, Bumbo, Moon, and so forth), to the oh-so-tragic ending of movie star Marion Street. I felt manipulated, after having read nearly 3/4 of the book, to finally encounter the crime and scandal, only to see it brushed over in a very few pages. And then we never exactly find out the true story--who ends up protecting whom in the scandal? For a story purporting to tell the ""real story,"" this one falls short."
16323,0,A slow read,"I have read all three of Sandra Dallas' books and maybe I shouldn't have read them one right after the other. This was the last one I read and I had a really hard time getting through this one. The characters were interesting and enjoyable but the story took a long time to get to the point, which WAS interesting once it finally got to the point. There were just too many un-necessary background details given. Like I said maybe I read too many of these books at once..."
16334,0,Pretty good but,Hey I have been a Robin Trower fan for many years. This is a good CD and its got some great guitar playing. However this isn't as strong a work as his early days. I think one thing is the vocals. His Dylan like singing is Ok but the best songs on this CD are the ones where his Co singer sings. His guitar playing is as incredible as ever and its always great to hear anything from this incredible underated musician. I actually liked 20th century blues better than this CD. But however this CD is still worth the money for any Trower fan. Keep putting out albums Robin we will never get enough of them.
16342,0,Fast moving - but very familiar,"Granted that this author is young and his writing style has not been fully developed as some other authors. I can think of some other authors who's early works are more stilted and whose plots are just as ""tired"" as this one. Also, many of parts of the book are painfully reminiscent of other authors: Tolkien, McCaffery, and possibly Lackey or McKiernan.But overall, who is to say that for a first time book that it was all bad? I think that if Mr. Paolini stays with writing that he will mature in hiw writing style and have a fruitful career. There are so few ways to deal with ""fantasy"" plots that there is going to be repetition of ideas between authors.Overall, this book was a nice diversion. A classic? No. Very few fantasy books can be categorized as classics. Is this book going to be on my top 10 list of all time? No. But is good enough that I am looking forward to his next book so I can see how he can deal with his version of this fantasy plotline."

16360,0,"Eragon Doesn't Hit the Mark, but Close","It is amazing that a 15 year old, now older, wrote such a long compelling story. However, it reads like a teenager wrote it at times and does not stand against the imagination of Harry Potter stories and the genius of ""Lord of the Rings"". It would have been nice to see some more originality.That said, it is a story worth reading and I definitely am hooked enough to read the Eldest book. I am hoping and optomistic to see improvement by this remarkable young writer."
16363,0,"A pretty good book -- not great, though","I read this book after a friend recommended it to me. The storyline is pretty well thought out but, yes, there are a few rip-offs from the Lord of the Rings and a number of other books. However,I enjoyed the characters and thought that it was a pretty good book. The writing is sometimes repetitive but otherwise generally well written. As I said before, the book is good not great."
16364,0,"Seems like a rip off, but still enjoyable","This book was appealing to me in many ways. I like fantasy, dragons, and any thing that has a blue cover. However, upon reading the book, I noticed alot of simalarities between this book and Star Wars. Though I had this trough my mind during the entire book, I was still able to read it with joy."
16370,0,"not great but a good book, liked the movie better","Great theme and characters- I had to speed read through some long boring details that would have been better left out. Why do authors think a book is not great unless it is really long? Kudo's to a Christopher Paolini writing this book,while a teenager. Yes it does ring strongly of borrowed stories and characters. But how many authors have copied vampire type themes after Twilight hit it big? Overall I enjoyed the characters and plot. A good book. I liked it better than ""Eldest"" the 2nd in the series. I really liked the movie better than the book- which is something I never ever say."
16372,0,Okay but immature writing,"The bottom line is that this book was written by a fifteen-year-old and has the immature style that is to be expected from someone so young. The book has potential, but there are all those niggling details to take care of. I see that it was published by his parent's publishing company, which explains a lot. I don't think a major publishing house would have touched it without major editing. It is way to early to be comparing this kid to Tolkien, Eddings, or Jordan, but I think Paolini has promise and I look forward to what he will be writing in the future as his style matures."
16374,0,Names and Events,"I have this book and while it is a good read I have to agree with B. Capossere's review of the book. While reading this book, I also saw the comparisons with Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings. For example, take the title of the book, ERAGON. If you've read the Lord of the Rings or seen the movie, you can definitely see the link to Tolkien. As for the Star Wars link, that goes into more of the plot of the book but again, it is defnitely apparent. I also saw a link to Dungeons and Dragons while reading. The story is different but the names are taken on the basis of other works and I think that even for a 17 year old, there should be more imagination in the world created. Would the story have lost it's appeal if different names were used? I don't think so. But it is a let down in the imagination aspect when similar names and events are used because your mind automatically goes to the other stories."
16379,0,Eragon Book,"The first time it was shipped, it was damaged because of poor packaging. But, I sent it back and the second time you sent it priority and it was packaged very well. However, it is a lot of trouble to have to send it back and wait and wonder if the next shipment is going to be okay."
16385,0,eragon-,"Eh. The fantasy world is sort of a rip-off from Lord of the Rings, with similar creatures- elves, dwarves, orks, etc., though the Dragon Rider background/legend was pretty interesting. Eragon as a hero is not really all that charismatic or like-able, just sort of a bland guy that just happens to have a bigger fate. He doesn't grow too much throughout the book either, but the plot is relatively interesting enough to ignore his lack of personality."
16387,0,The up-and-comer in classic fantasy fiction,"Many reviewers have addressed the opening of the book, the awkwardness of the first chapters and the formulaic treatment of plot and traditional fantasy peoples. Uh huh, all that is true.What is also true is that this is a first rate first novel. I've read (and finished, more is the pity) much worse. It's new classical fantasy fiction. Yes, it derives much from Tolkein, Eddings, McCaffery, et al. And some folks are bored with that and looking for a new voice and are correct to say ""don't look for that here"". But if you enjoy the classic coming-of-age, heroic quest type of story, LOOK HERE. Mr. Paolini has created a very readable (once you get past the first few chapters) book."
16388,0,What's all the adult hype about?,"Yes, I agree with everyone else, this book is a remarkable feat for a 17yr old author. However, as I read it, I kept sensing that it was obviously written by a teenager. The plot is basic and the characters lack a lot of depth - it just felt so predictable. Although my 12yr old daughter found it boring, I would definitely recommend to teen readers who enjoy the fantasy genre. As for adult readers, I can't figure out what all the hype is about."
16398,0,For Beginners,"It was obvious to me that Paolini was young when he began writing this book. Although very good for such a young author, it can't compare to much of the sci fi/fantasy I have read. The language of the book sounded like a young person with a thesaurus constantly by his side. I could have forgiven him for this except he made many of the characters also sound as if they kept a thesaurus by their side.The story itself is fun, if not entirely original. I am looking forward to the last book in the series and any future works by this author; I think that, as he matures, his originality and language will also."
16406,0,Good but not great,"I tried reading this book becasue it was so popular and I wanted to see what all the hype was about. Turns out not too much. The story is good but it is almost like a combination of all the classic fantasy stories.It is highly similair to Lord of the Rings in my opion and I was also reminded of The Wrinkle in Time series. I like the new takes on old ideas but the plot is really cliche and most of the charcters can be found in any fantasy novel. It is almost like a blueprint for fantasy novels.Of course the main character has parents that no one anything about, and that the main character has a great destiny before him. how many times have we heard this story? i mean come on the beginning chapters are almost straight out of Star Wars.The book looks cool but the story is anything but."
16410,0,Not Bad.....,"This book is predictable to a extent, especially if your familar with Tolkeins work and with The Dragonriders of Pern. Mix with a twinge of Star Wars for full effect. The book is intersting enough to keep at it. Its a good start to a series which I hope breaks free of the standard fantasy sterotypes."
16411,0,A Good Start for a good writer,"This book is pretty good, but you can tell that he has taken a lot off of other fantasy writers like Tolkien, but it is still a pretty good book. Hopefully he can improve on the sequels and make the series a memorable one."
16412,0,Mother & Son .....Differing Opinions,"My 9/10 year old and I read this book together last year and he LOVED it. The story moves quickly, the characters are accessible, and before the last paragraph ended, my son couldn't wait to discover what would happen in Eldest (the sequel).I 'enjoyed' the story as well, but the influences from Tolkein and other writers is painfully obvious. Also the story lacks depth, which may be a reflection on the writer's age. I would like this to be better than it is, but would nevertheless recommend it to other children aged 8-12."
16413,0,EXCELLENT READ,"This is an awesome book. It is a little boring at first, but speeds up as soon as you get into it really. I kept flipping back through the book and I thought ""Ohh. THAT'S what that was/why that happened."" Paolini is good at suspense, and a good writer. He got 3 stars because for my age group, it'd be hard to read. The book is about a kid named Eragon. He finds a dragon egg in the woods and goes on a quest to find the elves. It is reminiscent of LOTR, but with it's own twist. It's got some old, much-used characterisitics, but still manages to be original. I almost gave this a four star, but as I said, it'd be too hard for my age group. Oh, by the way, did I mention my age group is 10-12? Yeah. I'm 11."
16420,0,Star Wars meets lord of the Rings??,"Borrowing themes from fantasy classics like Tolkien and Science Fiction classics like Star Wars - Eragon was a very enjoyable read. Not impressively original or unique, but very well put together. This is not to say that Paolini fails to impress: he has taken some of the best elements of myths we all love and weaved them into a work that is his own. I very much enjoyed the book, and will definatly follow up with the second volume of the yet-to-be-materialized trilogy. Give us more Christopher - the world needs more fantasy!"
16426,0,OHP sheets,The product arrived in perfect shape and was good. I wish there were some tracing papers (butter papers) between the printing sheets because the printing sheets stick to each other sometimes and it is difficult to separate them.
16443,0,John Williams. . .where were you?,"I will say the movie was alright. . . .if you did not read the book; which I did. I was looking forward to the big Quidditch match, but was severely disappointed with the very few minutes they spent on it. The special effects were great and the dialogue was fine. My biggest problem was the music. The new composer was absolutely horrible. The music had no body or personality. It was absolutely boring musically. With John Williams, you go on a journey musically; there are new sounds and instruments. I really missed the women's voices and his ""magic touch"" if you will. I bought the soundtrack to see if I missed anything musically and was severely disappointed. I hope they bring back John Williams. This movie was not the same without him."
16445,0,"Good film, but not the best of the Harry Potter movies.","This was a good film. I liked the acting and the special effects, but I felt something was lacking. There wasn't enough conversations between the characters. Even though it's over two hours, it seemed much shorter. It felt like someone was pushing a fast foreward button too much."
16446,0,A review of the DVD Release - not the film. Its lacking.,"I've always felt that this space should be used to review the specific product features of the DVD itself, and not the film. Go to the IMDB for treatment of the films content, plot, etc. This is about what Warner Bros did to put the film on the DVD.That said, I'm dissapointed. If you pull out all 4 dvd release and compare them, you see that they are getting cheaper and you get less for the purchase with each one. While films 1 and 2 had cardboard boxes and inserts, movie 3 lost the cardboard box ( a small thing, and some may say an improvement) and now the 4th film lost all inserts as well. (I purchased my copy of the 2 disc kit from Wal-Mart).THe lack of any insert is really sad. A graphical depiction of whats, where on the 2 disc dvd, as was provided with film 3, and many other 'extended, multi-disc' releases, really is essential. It just seems like a profit maximizing effort by WB."
16449,0,"Amazing book, mediocre movie","There is no comparison to the book. The acting was horrible (kids, Dumbledore) but I assume they were just badly directed - why is Dumbledore raving and out of control? Furthermore, many interesting scenes were cut or shortened - at least give us more world cup quidditch! I love the first 3 movies but this one just didn't measure up. I hope OotP is better."
16453,0,Not the greatest Harry Potter movie,"As a fan of the Harry Potter series, I found the movie disappointing. I know that not everything in the book could make it into the movie, but more content then what was used would have made ""Goblet of Fire"" better. They skipped around so much it made it hard to follow the plot line. I would have liked to see the Dursleys and the rest of the Weasley clan in this one. Hagrid and Professor McGonagall seemed to be relegated to the background and the scene of Harry talking to Sirius in the fire was not realistic looking. Not too crazy about Michael Gambon as Dumbledore; the late Richard Harris was much better in the role.The movie didn't do the book justice. I can only hope ""Order of the Phoenix"" is better. Don't waste your money on ""Goblet"" and put it towards the last book in the series when it's published."
16456,0,Underwhelmed,"I left the theatre feeling like the goblet was half full. Passable but not memorable. I hope the movies aren't losing it, while the books are putting it all together. Make 5 & 6 fast."
16458,0,It was okay...,"This movie has great effects and it is chop full of action, but honestly as the movies progress the acting gets worse, a couple examples: Emma Watson as Hermione yelling at Harry ""I'm not an owl!"" please.. and Daniel Radcliffe's really bad crying job when he comes back from the graveyard with Cederic's body.. don't get my wrong i am a huge harry potter fan but this movie and the acting just didn't cut it for me."
16461,0,Disappointed in DVD,"I bought this DVD, not realizing that there was also a deluxe two disk set (we've never had these options in the past). I and my children were very disappointed to find that this DVD is just the movie (which we had seen at the theater). We had been looking forward to the deleted scenes, interviews, and interactive features. Obviously, we loved the movie itself, or would not have bought this one. Just beware that this is movie only with NO EXTRAS."
16463,0,The Hobbit in Review,"The Hobbit is a book about and hobbit named Bilbo and 13 dwarves. The dwarves take Bilbo on an adventure to regain their treasure that was stolen by a talking dragon. On the way Bilbo and the dwarves run into goblins, trolls and elves. All three of these creatures capture them but they end up escaping. They meet a man who can change into a bear and the Lord of the Eagles. They finally make it to the mountain where the dragon lives. The dragon is killed by a guy from lake town and the dwarves with Bilbo reclaim the treasure. A couple of days later every person who knew about the treasure was there to take the treasure. They a have the Battle of Five Armies and the dwarves keep their gold. Bilbo goes home and lives the rest of his days in his hole."
16471,0,An okay book,Review by Haley. I read this book in fifth or sixth grade. It was an okay book. It got kind of boring at some parts. I did enjoy a few parts of it though. It was worth reading but not one of my favorites.
16474,0,"Fun little story, audio quality was spotty","I remember listening to this as a kid so when I was looking for an audio book for my family's Thanks Giving trip, I grabbed this up. The story was just as much fun to listen to with my kids as it had been listening to it when I was a kid. The audio quality of this 4-disk set left much to be desired, though. It would have benifitted from being digitally re-mastered--or at lease adjusted so every track was at the same volume level. I ripped these disks when we got home from our trip and ran it through iTunes' equalizer and it's just fine now."
16476,0,From a 7th grader's point of view...,"I thought ""The Hobbit"" wasn't really a good book. But take into consideration that I was forced to read this book with my English class. I have just never really gotten into fantasy such as Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. (I prefer science fiction.)Although, it was still hard to follow and I felt that it changed points of view throughout the book. I didn't really enjoy it and I wouldn't suggest this book.Sincerely,A 7th Grader"
16496,0,Not charmed by the ensemble cast,"I really wanted to love this recording, but sadly just wasn't charmed by the ensemble cast. We listened to this on a road trip with the kids and the multiple voices annoyed the heck out of them (9 and 12)."
16497,0,This is a kids story,"This is the first time I've read this. This comes after reading GRRM, Rothfuss, Hobb, Brooks, Goodkind, etc so when I got into this book it was very light reading indeed. I love world building and great characters and it can be difficult to have those things in a book under 300 pages. It read like a quick, young adult or kids story leaving a lot of detail out, but I guess that is to be expected in a shorter book. I just didn't get into it."
16500,0,Picture is better,"I purchased this book as a gift, and while it is nice, the pictures of it are slightly deceiving. The marbled pages are more like blue dots, and the illustrations in the book are comic-like.However, the recepient was still pleased with it and for the price, it's a pretty good deal."
16505,0,INTERESTI NG,"This is a very iteresting book. It has all sorts of mysteries and surprises. Anyone under10 would like it. But according to my sister it is a little scary. Some of the adventures have to do with big spiders, dragons, and goblins."
16512,0,"Good book, but not anything special","The Hobbit, the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series, is a very well written book, but I recommend it only for those who are true fans of fantasy books. This book is about the expedition of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, and a company of dwarves. A wizard, Gandalf, also accompanies the hobbit. They intend to travel to the Lost Mountains to recover the treasure of the dwarves from the dragon, Smaug. Tolkein does very well at describing the adventures of Bilbo and his companions, but sometimes he gets too descriptive and the book gets a little dull. Still, other parts in the book are very exciting. I ended up enjoying this book very much, but I have read better books. This book is not a light book and will take some time to read. Overall, I don't consider this one of Tolkein's best literary works, but it deserves some recognition."
16514,0,The Hobbit,I read the Lord of the Rings and found that series very interesting so I thought the Hobbit would be a good read. It was on the same basis of Lord of the Rings and there was not as much action and suspence. It would be a good book for a younger child who wanted to read it then go onto the Lord of the rings. Also the Hobbit had many of the same things as in the other series so I found it repeative . It was well written so I would reccomend it to younger chilren.
16516,0,The Hobbit To the End and Back,"""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit."" Who wrote this line? J.R.R. Tolkien did. This book is a fantasy adventure about a band of dwarves, one wizard called Gandalf, and a hobbit called Bilbo Bagins. Together they embark on a journey to retrieve a lost treasure form a terrible dragon. On their journey they face Trolls, Goblins, and Wood Elves.This is one of my personal favorites. This is a fantasy adventure like no other. I would recommend this book to lovers of fantasy adventures. This book is a prelude to Lord of the Rings trilogy."
16530,0,It just is not the same,"Although not as bad as any video game or movie, this audio version still can't live up to the high standards set by tolkien fanatics, but on the other hand, every Tolkien Fanatic has allready read The Hobbit so there is no problem there. The book might however be good for the family vacation, my dad read me the hobbit, and instiled a life long love of reading in my mind, so this tape could be valuable to the lazy father... Just a thought!"
16550,0,Nice Little Noir,"PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET---(1953)Richard Widmark,Jean Peters, Thelma Ritter, Richard Kiley.I had not seen this film prior to ordering it but had seen/heard many references to it in discussions of film noir. Being a great fan of Widmark, I decided to add it to my collection. I found it to be a pretty good little film---nothing special, but enjoyable. Widmark plays yet another ""low-life"" that lives by his own ""code"". Thelma Ritter is especially good as the world-weary ""snitch"" who also has her own set of rules to live by. The film was made at the height of the ""Red Scare"" period and the obsession with, ""the Commies"", is somewhat dated---even comical, at times. Anyway, as I noted, not a great film, but, IMO, worth watching."
16551,0,More Anti-Commie than Noir,"SPOILERS: As a noir, the movie is a little disappointing. It has an agenda to satisfy a McCarthyite anti-communist litmus test above the demands of narrative. The main communist character, for example, is too nervous cowardly to meet with Widmark in the first reel and then shifts into homicidal mania to kill the sick, older lady in her bed. It looks good, though, and Widmark is great the role. Great dialog, too."
16553,0,true but too repetitive,"It's very true that most men like bitches better. i think it also works the other way around. If a man is too needy, a woman gets turned off. However, the book repeats this concept over and over again - it is enough to skim through parts of the book to get the key points. The author provides 100 rules/tips but a lot of them are on the same thing."
16562,0,Financial Neediness??!!,"Overall this book gave good advice, some I needed, some I knew and just didn't use correctly. I was happy with the purchase until she had the audacity to imply that a lack of general middle-class wealth implies neediness. Being disabled and unable to work, I live on a tight budget while on disability. I sell my paintings to supplement my income. However, I can by no means fly to Europe or take a trip to the Bahamas. Lack of monetary wealth does not mean lack of dignity or neediness!! If someone is going to judge me on lack of monetary wealth and a disability, then they can move on. I would advise her to watch herself the next time she shoots her mouth off. Things like that are easy to say when you make what she makes."
16563,0,It was ok,"Some things she says are really helpful, but somethings just make the man want to stop the chase (games) and give up. (And if you're the nuturing type [Cancer] these methods wont work for you anyways) So this book can work on some guys but not all. 50/50 chase of results. Just be yourself, and the right guy should come along"
16568,0,Only Touch the Subject,"I felt I already knew the answer, but I wanted to hear what the author had to say. The book only brushes over the real reason. It's a great book for someone that is totally clueless as why men really love bitches. I felt the book could have gone in more detail. This book only lightly touches the subject. I would not pay more than $5.oo for the book. The title is amazing and catchy. Some may think it's male bashing, but it's not. A good book for the clueless beginner to shed some light why they cant' be a good girl."
16584,0,Kinda Boring,"I rushed into the store to pay the 20 dollars for this book thinking that it would live up to the excitement of the others. i began thinking that maybe i was less exciting 10 years ago and didn't know any better. But i really have to believe that the writing of the previous 4 books in the series did not have such predictable sex scenes and ""caveman"" language. The dialogue is so staccato as to be baby like. very annoying."
16588,0,If I had not bought it I might not have...,"I should have read the book first. I never listen to critics or book reviewers, and I should have. The book was O.K. That is a very mild term for a book that, having taken 12 years to write, should have been a WOW. I have been a faithful reader of the Series, and I honestly expected The Shelters of Stone to have just as much ""punch"" as the prior books...it looks like Jean Auel got bored with this series and, realizing she has one more to do, repeated herself ad nauseum. I will read her final book in the series, but I won't buy it unless it is at least fifty times better than Shelters of Stone."
16592,0,Still tiresome!,"Tedious in some areas and almost like a history book! I think the author spent way too much time researching the surrounding area, plants and animals when they were already mentioned in the previous books. Also too much reviewing of what happened in the other books. If you read this one, there's no need to read the others before this and way too long. Seems like the author sticks in the sexual scenes in odd places like the publishers told her to in order to sell books! These too were tedious, too!"
16593,0,Kindle edition riddled with errors and typos.,What on earth was used to convert the book to Kindle format? It's full of typos and punctuation problems as if a software program did a BAD conversion job and no one bothered to check for errors. It's annoying and should be sold at a discount to make up for it. Like the previous reviewer said - it's a reading distraction.
16598,0,Drawn out. Okay. Needs more action and personality.,I like page turners...Story was good. Just that I expected more from such a best seller.
16607,0,MUCH TOO MUCH,"This book was interesting in parts, but very boring in others. There was much too much background information, and I found myself skimming much of the book. The love scene dialog was boring and repetative. I would have liked more information about the characters, and much less information about the geography and the living spaces. Not up to the other titles in this series."
16613,0,Good... but missing something,A very dissapointing addition to the Earth Children's series. The Shelters Of Stone was missing alot of the heart that the previous 4 books had.
16621,0,Shelters of Stone - Kindle edition,This is another case of a manuscript bieng scanned and run through OCR software and then not bothering with so much as a spell check program. Still a lot of wrong words which will stop you dead in your tracks as you try to figure out what the word should actually be and a lot of not words that you get to puzzle out what ought to be. Not so bad as to be unreadable but annoying in the extreme. What ever happened to publishers actually proofing work before it is released? If they had released a paper edition in this condition they would be getting returns by the case load!
16628,0,Moderatly disappointed,"As with many others I was anxiously awaiting the release of the new book. For years I had been hearing rumors that Auel had cancer and died, or other crazyness that another book was not being released. Now that I have read the book, and again re-read the series and Shelter's of Stone, I am begining to find the wordiness and repetitivenous tedious. I started to feel that she was cutting and pasting paragraphs from one book to the other. This final book was an OK read, but not the page turner that the other books were. I sincerly hope the next book is a step up."
16635,0,It's interesting novel,"Since I've read all of Auel's books back to back this winter, I did find this novel rather repetitive ~~ I already know what has happened to Ayla in the past ~~ and I was rather disappointed that this book wasn't flushed out like her other novels. I love reading about Ayla and Jondular ~~ I love reading about the craftwork, the hunting, and how they survive in prehistoric times but there wasn't much new in this novel and she left it hanging ~~ so I am assuming that there will be a sixth book in the series.If you're interested in prehistoric times, start with the Clan of the Cave Bear, The Valley of Horses, and Mammoth Hunters ~~ they are the best novels in the series. Also, they're not so focused on the sexual aspect of Ayla's life, like her two last novels (including this one). If you want to read more on romance, this book is for you!It's an ok novel ~~ not the greatest and not the best. I haven't given up on Auel yet ~~ I am anxiously waiting for the next one!3-12-04"
16636,0,Be prepared for the change in Ayla's voice,"I enjoyed reading Clan of the Cave Bear about 25 years ago. I've been enjoying the series again on audio. Everything went well until I reached this book, which picks up minutes after the 3rd book ended. Somehow in those few minutes, Ayla acquired a Transylvanian accent. Her voice has deepened and she sounds like Elvira. I'm not sure why this change in direction was chosen, but it is very annoying and off putting. I felt like I didn't know the character any longer. Only now, in the last chapter of this epic novel am I getting used to her new voice.I would have expected a speech impediment, maybe, but an accent? She came from people who didn't speak...where on earth would she have gained an accent, and why only add it now?"
16640,0,Loaded Backstory,"Jean M. Auel's much anticipated THE SHELTERS OF STONE has Jondalar and Ayla ending their journey to his home and planning their wedding. Each treasure they share with his people is burdened with extensive details from previous books which makes for either much skipping or slow going for the reader.Buried in the tome are snips of insight and discovery that have entralled readers of past volumes. Ms. Auel deserves a good editor to cut the line between supporting detail and leading fill.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
16653,0,Dated,"I had read every Louisa May Alcott novel as a girl, begining with Little Women with great pleasure. Recently I sat down in excited anticipation to read this story to my ten-year-old daughter, only to have both of us fall asleep in record time. Poor Ms. Alcott's stories have fallen on the sword of the sparkling fast-paced prose of the likes of J.K. Rowling and the modern poetic stories of such authors as Alice Walker. Little Women is the story of four New England daughters of a father away fighting in the American Civil War. Illustrating their bravery and spirit, coming of age, romances and tragedies, I remember happily losing myself in their story, but now find the language so ponderous that it is impossible to re-read. I'm sorry to admit that my old friend is collecting dust on the shelf, but the world is full of great books of our time just waiting to be read in substitution."
16655,0,Still a joy to read,"I read this many times as a child and am enjoying it all over again. Yes, the language is a little dated but the story is still touching and the book is filled with life lessons that still apply today. Worth a read."
16656,0,Little Women,"I read Little Women recently and I would probably reccommend it to anyone that is okay with a sad, romantic book. The main character is Jo, a tomboy growing up in the late 19th century. It is Jo's story as she becomes an adult, and I think it is a great coming-of-age book for both boys and girls. (Girls would probably enjoy it a little more than boys.) Either way, it's a great book and you should read it as soon as you get your hands on it."
16669,0,classic,.it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
16673,0,This is a dog-lover's story - I love beagles!,"The movie is good and kept the class of 3rd graders attention and interest. However, we were all disappointed with the movie not following the book...characters, some storyline, and ending is so very different. The book was an Newberry Award winning book - wish Hollywood would not have made the changes."
16677,0,Translated into english = substitles in english only!,"I am a huge fan of Beauty and the Beast in pretty much any form. But here is the problem. On Amazon's web site and on the package of this DVD, it states ( Original Fable translated into english. ) In truth this means english subtitles. I bought this in the pretence that the actual movie itself would be english spoken. So I was quite disapoined when I found out it hadn't realy been translated into english. When you have to constantly read the subtitles its hard to actually enjoy the movie. It was going at a fast pace. This is why I give this DVD 3 stars intead of 5 stars. Because I got myself excited about it being in english, instead I got a huge let down."
16678,0,The New Beauty Is Just OK,"Well...I almost hate to write this, because there's no doubt that Criterion is the platinum standard in DVD. I just watched a review copy of the ""restored"" Beauty And The Beast and it's not as ""beauty""-ful as the original Criterion edition that came out a few years ago. The film does look pristine, but the depth of the original is missing. It almost looks too squeaky clean and...well, digital. Make no mistake, you'll be completely entrhalled by this DVD, but if you can get your hands on the other Criterion edition, do it. You'll be even more enchanted."
16682,0,"very poorly done,but i've had more painful experiences","despite the fact that this film is pretty poorly done from from every every aspect you can think of,it's still manages to be a guilty pleasure.it comes off more as a Mel Brooks parody type of a movie than an actual serous attempt at film making,although it does try to take itself seriously,which of course makes it all the more funny.there are definitely a lot of eye rolling moments here.and yet,this is nowhere near as bad as many so called movies floating around out there.there's some entertainment value here,and it isn't all that painful to watch,relatively speaking.try Dark Town,or Dracula 3000,if you really want to know pain,and then get back to me.as for this one,i give it a 3/5"
16684,0,For the Movie Fanatic,Not as scary as I remembered it to be however good to have in a collection. Ingrid Bergman as always is wonderful.
16685,0,Pretty good old movie,This is a friend's favorite movie so I thought I would rent it. It was okay. Kind of slow. Definitely not my favorite.
16686,0,Doesn't live up to its prequel,"Not a bad book, but unfortunately most of the other characters are more interesting and play a more important role than the two main characters (A.C. Doyle and Jack ""Sherlock Holmes"" Sparks). If you liked the hints at real and fictional characters from ""The list of 7"", this book comes a little short in this respect, too."
16695,0,Too Much Formula,"Considering that Lee Ann has been around for a few years now, this album is deemed to be her breakthrough hit. Sadly, despite the wonderful and moving ""I hope you dance"", she seems to have been pidgeonholed with so many other up and coming female stars, as to releasing ""what sells"", instead of exploring her own creative talents. Not knowing whether to be country, new country or country pop - one could easily close there eyes, and mistake most of the songs herein for anyone of her peers. Despite her wonderful vocal range, something gets lost in the shelf wrapped collection of mundane and flat songs on the album. A great pity, after a single release that promised so much more."
16701,0,interesting,"Not one of Allende's best efforts, however I still found the novel interesting to read. Set in Chile, China, and California between 1843 and 1853, it is an interesting mix of historical fiction; a social commentary on the British of the day; a look at prejudices in the USA; a glimpse into the chinese culture; and relationships which have gone awry. Alot of ground to cover in one novel, however Allende's talent for storytelling ties all the elements toghether in an easy to read fashion which make for an enjoyable novel. As always, her strong female characters and matriarchial family structure is present. Hija de la Fortuna is a lighter read than her other novels, and very recommendable."
16704,0,You only get ONE!,"You only get ONE (1). Don't be misled by the advertising - it clearly makes it seem like you're getting several. They're also disappointingly small, though I purchased mine intending to use them ('it' apparently) for juggling."
16708,0,"Good, but some problems . . .","Strengths: This book explains Exchange Server 5.5 in a way that is succinct and easy to read. Many of the practice questions are difficult and challenge your mastery of the material.Weaknesses: There aren't enough step-by-step descriptions of how to perform important tasks. The book glosses over a number of important details about Exchange Server and its clients, making its coverage superficial in some respects. Some of the practice questions can't be answered without prior hands-on experience (i.e., the information in the book is inadequate).Bottom line: If you have plenty of experience with Exchange Server, this book is probably adequate preparation for the test. However, if you have never used Exchange Server before, this book might not be enough to prepare you -- you might want to look at getting the Microsoft Training Kit as well, or Tony Redmond's book."
16709,0,Software is [bad]!,"I love the Yepp MP3 player itself. It's cool looking and has some really cool features. However, the software it comes with leaves much to be desired. The most annoying problem is how it tries to organize file names. It doesn't let you sort by date modified and tries to split the file names into track title, artist, and album. That's great if your files are ripped from a CD, but if your files are downloaded, you're out of luck. Also, the system won't let you play tracks while you're in the selection window, and since the file names get all [messed] up, you can get really mixed up and frustrated. I've tried side stepping these problems by using the Windows Media Player Portable Device function and that won't work either... some unknown error. All in all, I think one might be better off waiting a while until Samsung upgrades the software or at least lowers the price. For my money there are just too many inconveniences to make this a truly great buy."
16713,0,Great Expectations is a poor intro to Dickens,"Although Great Expectations is better-written than most contemporary novels (Miss Havisham alone makes the book worth reading and demonstrates Dickens' wonderful skill with characters), I fear that GE is most people's only contact with Dickens because it's short enough to assign for school. (So is A Tale of Two Cities, a great story, but not much like other Dickens works.) If you can stick with them, I recommend even more highly Dickens' Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend, David Copperfield, and Little Dorrit--they're long but they are great, well-written stories with fully developed characters and (sometimes mysteriously long) plot and description that turns out to be crucial (you get a hint of that in GE). Don't give up on Dickens; his works are classics for good reason."
16714,0,Dickensian values,Fascinating tale of a young man's encounters with upwardly mobile life and the moral values involved. Still highly pertinent in the 21st century.
16716,0,"good plot, but very hard to follow.","OK... I know how Dickens is supposed to be this wonderful author, but lets just face it - Its boring! Its not his fault, when he wrote everyone wrote like that, but these days its just too hard to follow.. The plot was really good tho.. almost like an old soap opera, with twists and turns everywhere.. Now if he could have written the same story in 200-300 pages instead of 500, maybe people would enjoy this book more!"
16724,0,"Great novel, not so great edition","Though this is a decent, affordable edition of Dickens' late masterpiece, any mildly curious reader should buy the Oxford Classics edition instead. The notes in the Oxford Classics edition are much better (more thorough and more informative), and so is the introduction. George Bernard Shaw's introduction to this Modern Library edition is an intelligent piece of criticism, but it's also very partial and shortsighted. There's nothing terribly wrong with the Modern Library edition, but it's not the best one. I have used this for a class I was teaching, but next time I'll be using the Oxford Classics instead (unless something better comes along in the meantime)."
16735,0,Final Morse episode: less than expected,"Perhaps I've been spoiled by watching 'Inspector Lewis' in the years since John Thaw died. Seeing Lewis's management style with Hathaway has made me more sharply aware of just how abusive Morse was toward Lewis. Or perhaps I've just gotten older, and less tolerant of bullies, and more willing to say so.Nonetheless, I'd looked forward with great anticipation to the final episode of ""Inspector Morse,"" figuring that we might actually be treated to the sight of a moving transition from old curmudgeon to young apprentice. This did not happen. Granted, the actor was ill and dying, but I frankly expected more from the writers. We were left with a disconnect that was not addressed in the opening episode of ""Inspector Lewis,"" or ""Lewis"" as it's sometimes called."
16739,0,"Cool cars, crazy storyline","The title about says it all. It makes ya cringe a little watching them beat up the ""classics"". But as with alot of 70's movies they just put the car on full out and let the cameras roll. You should see it once just for the cars."
16740,0,40 year old car stunts,"The movie is 70s period and very campy, but good car stunts. There's also some light gratuitous nudity which I personally appreciate, but that's the way they made movies then."
16747,0,About average,"These are good shorts, but not nearly the utility, design or materials of the discontinued Cliff Lakes from Columbia. I go through three or so pairs of these each year. Yeah, basically live in them much of the year. Hiking, biking, whatever. Probably will shop around for something better."
16748,0,Good but not great,"These are good quality shorts from an experienced producer. The material is heavy duty and the pocket designis not as utilitarian as their Platimum series shorts. Also, the sizing runs large, so the shorts Ibought should have been marked one size larger.Overall, after trying a few times, I ordered several pairs of the Platium series shorts instead."
16755,0,"Extremely useful, but extremely hard to get through","This book is of great importance to me - Peperzak addresses many nuances in Levinas' thought I wouldn't find myself. However there is a catch: the language used by Peperzak is quite difficult to understand and get through. I don't mean the depth of thought, metaphorical language or anything like that. It's just Peperzak's English which is quite crude and rough. I highly doubt this book had a good proof reading it really deserves. Maybe it's just me, since I'm not English native speaker, but if you're feeling you English skills are not good, you may be disappointed after buying this book.P.S. My critique refers mainly to chapter ""A Key to Totality and Infinity""."
16758,0,"Great concept, poorly executed","Poor writing and direction push what should be a heart-warming family film deep into hackneyed mediocrity.Geena Davis and Lori Petty give the strongest performances, but it's not enough to call this a ""good"" film."
16759,0,Very Good movie-horrible ending,This was on its way to being a superb movie until the ending left us with the message that lying is the best way to deal with a problem and that ignorance and selfishness should be rewarded.
16772,0,"""Waiting for the World to End"" well written","In ""Waiting for the World to End"", Tom Olsen is a middle-aged high school English teacher and basketball coach. He has never married and is haunted by the abortion he and his first fiance had 20 years earlier. He gets through daily life by not caring about much and having a beer or 2 every day. He meets his star player's mother, Mary, and instantly falls head over heels for her. He can never have her. His dream could become a reality, though, after a secret her husband Virgil has been harbouring coms out 3 quarters of the way through the book. It has many fate-determining events throughout the book and it never really loses your attention. The plot and characters were very well written and developed. It isn't, however, a favorite of mine."
16776,0,Back story to advocacy movement.,"I thought this was an interesting insight into how a well-known personality (such as George Clooney) can do something under the radar and show up to greatly enhance awareness for an advocacy movement. In this documentary we realize that George Clooney and his father went unannounced to Darfur to ""shine a light"" (a camera's light)on the genocide. Moreover, they were trying to make it back to the USA with images from Darfur BEFORE a planned rally in Washington DC. Besides hearing refugees interviewed, I found myself wondering: What if George Clooney had never gone? What if he didn't make it back in time before the rally? What if he and his father hadn't done a ton of media interviews?"
16777,0,Not bad,I bought these for the cost and for the reason of sending video letters to my boys. I found they hold up well and they aren't to bad unlike others that charge a arm and a leg to get only three. I like these cause of the cost and the amount you get. Thats why I wou8ld buy more when I need to.
16780,0,Not my usual cup of stuff,"I love Deborah Smith, but decidedly prefer her more general stories. As straight-up froth romance goes this is unique and romantic. But it has the typical keep-secrets-from-your-lover conflict device that turns me off."

16810,0,"Book was okay, ending was a big disappointment","I thought overall the book was good, and unlike everyone else I didn't have the killer pegged at all! I was actually quite surprised. I thought the book had a lot of loose ends and subplots that just fizzled out. The relationship between Ginger and Ruben was just left hanging, as was the relationship between Stacey and Danny. I thought the teenagers' vocabulary was unrealistic. Dialogue was NOT typical of high school kids; too formal and robotic. Never quite understood the whole Malcolm Purdy deal-- really unnecessary to this story, I think. I hear Ms. Sloan's first book is terrific though... think I'll read that one."
16812,0,"The only one of her books I've read, so I don't know if it's her best!","I read 'One Night of Scandal' partly as a change of pace from my usual reading, and partly because I was running out of books to read!I found I could skip over quite a bit of it without feeling I'd missed anything. The changes in tone from light banter to heavy, brooding drama, to the usual 'steamy' scenes, were pretty much the standard for books like this. Since I'm not a big romance fan anyway, I didn't mind the emphasis on the relationship between Lottie and Allegra, though I felt the last chapter was a bit too predictably melodramatic. Still, the story was at its best when it was just the two of them.Hayden was a bit too wussy to take seriously, and I didn't really mind his occasional absences. All the buildup with his background and his first wife's 'troubles' didn't quite deliver what it promised.Recommended for those who like historical romance novels, but not for those who are really picky about plot development!"
16819,0,classic tv,"If you want kids to see something descent, and not having to worry about vulgarities, and things they shouldnt see. Older shows like facts of life, will give you good clean entertainment.And for people who are a tad older it gives you a blast from the past, a retro feeling"
16822,0,"not a mono-headset, poor plastic quality, however good sound quality","I ordered this thinking it was a ""mono"" headset but received it with two ear pieces. (make sure you get the Cyber Acoustics with ""mono"" written in the name). Also, the plastic is more of a greenish dull metallic color than the bright silver color pictured. Plastic is of poor quality, however sound quality is GREAT. Ideal for the price, though photo isn't accurate."
16823,0,Video Review,"I purchased this video in hopes it would be as good as Tammilee's Abs of Steel. The first workout is good, but the second is better if you are looking to feel the ""burn"". I did not attempt the 3rd workout with the step. It seemed a little more aerobic than I like and I do not own or plan to buy a step. I was hoping for more target toning than this video provided, but felt it provided a good workout for the buns. The trick she shows you in the second workout will have you ""bouncing"" in your car, at work or anytime you need to feel that little extra in your buns."
16826,0,good but not great,i saw it no myers a bit slow but it is quite good why did they call it halloween 3 not just season of the witch

16840,0,Halloween 3 ?,"Unfortunately, John Carpenter made a big mistake when he named this movie Halloween 3. Audiences did not take too kindly to this film due to the lack of Michael Myers and the fact that Halloween 3: Season of the Witch did not relate at all to the previous Halloween movies. I think this film would have been more successful if the title had just been ""Season of the Witch"".But let's look at what was good about this movie. It is a good murder mystery in a way which includes some super natural events, the movie is tense at certain points, and the ending is surprising.However, I only give this movie 3 stars because I have seen better horror movies than ""Season of the Witch"" and I think John Carpenter should not have ended here with the Halloween series."
16863,0,"Fun, but know what you're getting","I received this game as a Christmas gift as there isn't much golfing in Upstate NY in the winter. The product does a good job of enforcing good fundamentals, but takes a bit to get used to. The sensor is embedded in the control unit and is sensitive to ANY movement above or near it, which can result in added strokes. I would have hoped the graphics to be better as they were about Nintendo (Original, 1983) quality. The unit does not come with an AC adapter but has the receptacle for an aftermarket one, which I purchased at a local electrical store for an extra $15."

16877,0,a few things before buying this phone ...,"the first thing you need to know is that this phone is completely made it to be used in china. The phone offer some options that are made it just to be used with a ""china phone service"" (to name it in some way)Once you find where you can change the language to english, you will seethat the phone works great, it does what it need to do, camera, bluetooth, radio, 10Mb of capacity, and is a good looking phone.In my country (Costa Rica), the phone worked perfectly ... i could make calls, send messages and do everything your SIM card allow you to doit doesnt come with earphones ... just the phone and the charger ... and a lots of chinese manuals and one manual in englishDont expect a cheap camera ... expect a super bad camera ...so you got it, this is the phone you are looking if you want a cheap one .. i just hope you could find where to change to language faster than me"
16878,0,It's ok,"This isn't the best phone in the world but it will do. It has a lot of problems with reception; I have a contract with ATT and broke my phone, this phone was a replacement for the old one. The problem, however, is that this phone does not get reception where my old phone used to. Plus the reception fades in and out."
16879,0,These run very small,"These shorts run ridiculously small. I triple checked the size on the tags and on the interior because I was so sure I was sent the wrong pair. Since these are so much smaller than I expected, I would definitely recommend trying these on in a store to determine size. Plus, I didn't know until too late that the seller gouges the price for shipping, in both directions, which is going to make returning them a really expensive hassle. So, be sure to review all the necessary details of the shipping policy and rates before purchasing."
16882,0,Wonderful arrangements and musicianship,"The sound on this CD is beautiful, and the performances are excellent, with something for everybody. The additional musicians enhance the sound without overpowering the music. However, every recording has its bad moments, and I would have given this recording five stars save for the annoyingly pretentious acapella solo vocal kickoff to ""Wade in the Water"". This few seconds is justification enough to knock off a star or two. The classical numbers are tastefully done, and the new version of ""In Crowd"" moves along nicely. Worth buying, but program your player to skip ""Wade in the Water."""
16883,0,Worth reading,"Here is Paine's famous book-by-book attack on The Bible's authenticity and (to a lesser extent) case for Deism. It is informative and readable, well presented and (mostly) well reasoned.There are perhaps a half dozen or so times where his vitriol overtakes his reason, and the heat of his hatred for Christianity becomes rather tiresome, but other than that, I think his criticism holds much water.As to the science, I think that outside of a few times where he strays past the limits of the history and archaeology of his day this book holds up surprisingly well today.I would like to have seen more positive arguments for Deism as opposed to negative arguments against Judaism and Christianity (and Islam to a much lesser extent) but I think, probably, he was writing to an already Deist audience."

16901,0,A bit of fun,"First of all, this game is nothing like the PES-brand you might be used to play. It has simple graphics, sound and gameplay. Unlike, for that matter, the PSP version.Out of this, it's a pretty catchy game, although very, very easy.By now, I would recommend look for a more recent version of the game."
16903,0,so-so,"I was disappointed at this book, because the previous ones had been great. At first I thought that the plot could really turn into something big, but then it just fizzled out. The battles just didn't have the same impact as they did in the other books. In the other books, you really felt the importance of all of the battles, because you felt like the whole universe depended on the outcome of one battle. With this, it was sort of like, okay, so what that there's a battle. I finished the book, but mostlly because I felt that if I didn't read it, I would be majorly confused in the next books. It was sort of like she just stopped writing the book, and had someone else write it for her because she didn't want to write it. I would not recommend buying this book alone, because its biggest value is having information that you would need in the next books."

16922,0,"Despite Spectacle, Gladiator is NOT for Everyone.","I very much enjoyed the visual mastery of this film. Scott's direction, as always, is top-notch. Cinematography, art direction, costumes . . . everything visual about this film is dead-on. Unfortunately the movie too often slips into passages of such extremely grotesque violence that my enjoyment of the film was diminished. Also distracting is a storyline which lacks depth and originality.This is not a bad film by any means. It is certainly an accurate depiction of what life may have been like for a Roman Gladiator. I'm just not sure it's something I needed to see in such gory detail.The true gem in this film, along with superior visuals, is the amazing performance of Joaquin Phoenix."
16948,0,RUMORS,I kept going over and over the reviews on amazon about this bluray being shotty. So I held off buying it until i figured they had worked out the bugs. The bugs being the not so good transfer of the film into the bluray format. I bought it when i heard it was all set and received it and checked the indicators that it was the newer edition distributed by WB. The picture quality on about 60% was high quality while many of the scenes had a heavy grain accompanied by specs of blinking small lights. It was enough to be very much noticeable. Im not going to send it back because i doubt they will com out with another for sometim and im content with the way it is right now.
16954,0,Gladiator ( Extended Edition ),"They did a great job with the entire film. But, they did a poor job with the audio. What happened to the DTS ES 6.1 audiothat the first release had. It makes this a downer. Come onare they planning to hit us with another version?"
16958,0,Unique and for Younger Readers.,"In this book, two young kids find a book called 'So You Want to Be a Wizard'. This dramatically changes both of their lives as they begin to study the magical art.This story has action, humor, and magic. I thought that the story was very unique and interesting, a twist on the Harry Potter series, but at some moments I found that an important piece of action would happen in half a sentence and I had almost missed it. In my opinion, it was a good book for younger and less advanced readers that sometimes lacked detail. Recommended to both boys and girls ages 8-10."
16961,0,So You Want A Good Book?,"This book is OK. It is very long. Depending on the reader, the length can be good or bad. I did not like it because, unlike Harry Potter, it is not very funny and you cannot relate to the characters. The book is very serious and deep. While you're reading it, you'll sometimes go ""What?!"" and have to stop and think about everything. Yes, this book is a fantasy, but that's all it and Harry Potter have in common. If you're looking for a good fantasy book, try the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" or anything by Gail Carson Levine instead."
16968,0,meh..,it was just ok. now i don;t even remember how it ended so i guess i could not finish this book.the writing needs a little more work.
16976,0,A political tragedy,"Sean Penn plays the part of a man who is elected governor of the state of Louisiana by promising poor people food, roads, schools, and other things they have been denied by crooked politicians. Unfortunately, once he gets into office he becomes the most crooked politician of them all. Jude Law is the reporter who watches him become governor and then joins his staff, becoming a part of the fraud and corruption. This movie has terrific potential and combines a brilliant novel and a stellar cast, but unfortunately it misses the mark by having a script which plays the same note throughout. There is an inexorable march towards a tragic end. There is no comic relief, no change of tone, only a steady drumroll toward disaster. There is an emotional sameness to it throughout the film which keeps it from becoming the outstanding movie which its makers intended it to be."
16979,0,Penn and company save the film,"this remake of the 1949 film is not as good as that version,but it'sstill watchable,particularly for the performance of Sean Penn.hetranscends the material.watching him here,i can't help but think he maybe the greatest living actor of his generation,at the very least.JackieEarle Haley(whom i had heard a lot of good things about but had never seenbefore)is also exceptional in a small role,as is Patricia Clarkson.therest of the supporting cast are also good.really all of the actors arebetter than the movie they are in.this is really an actor's film.thefilm itself tends to drag and be long winded and veer off track,losingmomentum which it never fully gains.if it weren't for Penn's bravuraperformance,this would likely be a skippable movie.but he(and byextension,the rest of the cast)salvages the film.for me,All the King'sMen (2006) is a 3/5"

16984,0,"Ok, but a little thin","I am using this book in a class I am currently teaching. It's fine, gives a decent rundown on the major plagues and includes non-infectious plagues which adds another dimention to the text. Still, it is a tad brief for anything much other than an overview."
16989,0,Good but standard,"While not a bad movie as many seem to believe, ""Henry 2"" of course doesn't compare to the classic original. The innovative, stark horror was there in the first film; it isn't present in any great degree in the sequel. So this is basically a good, standard thriller, a nice follow-up but not really the same type of film."
16996,0,"good insight, lots of words","After finishing this book I look back on it and feel as though not much was actually said. I enjoyed the perspective on people reactions to such awful conditions, but, to me the book seemed very wordy.Perhaps this was just due to personal taste and this is not my type of read."
17000,0,I was torn about how I enjoyed it,"This is a great book...no doubt about it, but some of the style was difficult. I am sure it will go down in history as one of the great philosophical novels of our time, but its not perfect."
17016,0,More like A Clockwork Tangerine!,"Some consider this to be Kubrick's masterpiece. In my opinion Dr. Strangelove was his masterpiece, but Orange is a master work, nonetheless. It's a dark tale of prophecy, a vision of a bleak future, violent and vicious in the extreme, which some might also say we're living in today, judging by the headlines.So this is a great movie, but this DVD is a great disappointment! Despite what the details above say and what it says on the disc snap-case, the film is not in widescreen letterbox format, but is in full screen format! And the image quality is only fair-to-good. The sound is OK on my mono TV speaker but evidently is not Dolby multi-channel. And the theatrical trailer freezes at various points during playback. There's a chapter index and a list of awards the movie won or was nominated for, and that's about it for bonus features! One can only hope that the next release of this movie on DVD will do it justice, and make it a true Kubrick collectible!"
17021,0,its missing something,"The white version of this movie is missing at least one valuable scene(the murder scene). If you want the true effect of the movie, then I suggest that you find a better version. Without this scene, some of the story is missed, like how he got caught."

17037,0,it's just okay,"I believe this product may either be for those who never workout, or perhaps elderly or weaker people (no offense!), because even at the third, greatest tension, it's way too easy. I would have to do TONS of reps to benefit noticeably. One problem I have encountered is that having to hold onto the handles, with my arms bent so drastically, for an extended period of time, and WITH tension being placed on my elbows' tendons REALLY makes my elbows sore, and I worry a bit if this will not cause long-term damage/discomfort. One suggestion, too, would be for them to place a rubber patch on the part that rests on the legs, because unless one has it a just the right position, the contraption tends to slip."

17044,0,It's OK but...,"It's an OK book, but I have one major gripe with it: it has a lot of generalizations and not enough specifics in it. Like, it brushes over the topics without going into depth about them, as though it expects you to find half the information in that book elsewhere. I'd say skip this one, it's not worth the money + the shipping & handling. Because although it has some good ideas, you have to basically already be a playa in order to put them into practice. I, however, am not."
17055,0,"Psycho Circus...We wanted the best, but fell a bit short.","Psycho Circus was certainly not the best that Kiss has to offer, but it certainly is not the worst by any means. The ""circus music"" intro is cool and leads well into the best song (The title track). Other songs which are worth noting are Raise Your Glasses, Journey of 1,000 Years, We Are One, and Dreamin. Their upcoming tour should be a spectacle to see with the proper mix of songs. Kiss is still the best Live band to date! The album is worth buying even if half the songs will by bypassed by the CD button."
17057,0,Psycho Circus just so-so,"I don't know what else I was expecting, but I guess I'm not surprised. It's just the Gene and Paul show with 1 track from Ace and Peter just to prove to everyone that they showed up. Don't get me wrong, some of the songs are excellent. Songs like ""Within"", ""Journey of 1000 years"", and the title track are all stellar. The rest just show everyone how conceited Kiss are. And to top it all off, I've had to program out ""I've Finally Found My Way"", absolutely the worst ballad Kiss has ever recorded. Kiss should've stuck with Bruce and Eric and recorded a heavy record like ""Revenge"" and ""Carnival Of Souls"". They may not have sol as many concert tickets, but they would have recorded one hell of a better album. At the very least, Gene's songs should have been a bit darker to match his demon persona. And ten tracks clocking in at under 45 minutes - shame on you. That may have been good enough for 1978, but not 1998."
17058,0,"not great, but a start","The way I see it, after 18 years apart, this cd was about what I expected. Not great, but a start.The shining moments for me include, ""Psycho Circus"", ""Into The Void"" and ""Raise Your Glasses"".Kiss has never had an all the way thru great studio album, and they still do not.You know what though, so what?!They still are the greatest live band in the world. All these young punks out there today should take notes,Kiss is what rock and roll(over)is suppost to be about. No whiners allowed,long live the best, KISS!"
17059,0,Kiss returns with a raucous vengeance,"Kiss returns to the heavy metal world with a new and raucous album. Psycho Circus's cool album cover and concept gives fans a refreshing and introspective look into the band's triumphant return. The songs sound different from the seventies albums and yet still retain a good rock and roll sensibility.I listened to this album over fifty times and like some of the songs, including ""Psycho Circus,"" ""Into The Void,"" ""Raise Your Glasses,"" and ""I Pledge Allegiance To The State Of Rock And Roll."" Still, the album might have a better effect when integrated with the band's live show. Nevertheless, ""Journey Of A Thousand Years"" symbolizes the band's resiliency and longevity."
17061,0,"Not ""Revenge"" but most certainly PURE KISS!","Although, ""Revenge"" was probably the best album to date, ""Psycho Circus"" is most definitely KISS. The music on this CD reminds me of the early years, rough & loose, but still something you can rock out to. I highly recommend it to any KISS fan!"
17062,0,What did you expect? It's a KISS album!,"Bruce Fairbairn did a good job of production on this uneven effort, getting a great sound out of the fab 4. Unfortunately, not all of the material was worth the effort. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy the album. Cuts like ""Psycho Circus,"" ""Within"" and ""Into the Void"" really kick. There are some other good moments as well. It's similar to many other KISS albums where it seems that the boys figured that once they had 5 or 6 good songs, the rest didn't matter as much. All in all, I'm glad I bought it. It's a kick for a long time fan to have something new from the original version of the group."

17086,0,um ok,"this book was pretty rad. Some people think that this book has fowl lanugage and stuff, but who doesnt curse. Also, the book was kind of slow in the beginning, but once the British came to town is got better. Finnally, Howard FAst makes it seem like you are there by not say ing ""he said/she said"". This was my lame review on April Morning."
17087,0,I think it was okay but got boring,The book April morning was okay to me. It had the talking and the action . I found that instead of having equal action and equal talking it was about 90 percent talking and 10 percent action. Okay 70-30 but still it should be 50-50. I thing it taught me alot about the revolutionary war and about our country. If it really came down to it I would read a violent book and just read this one for abook report or something

17091,0,"Decent enough play, but no match for Crucible or Salesman","This autobigraphical work is written in a confusing ""Memory play"" fashion. This means that Miller jumps time periods, and fails to tell as fluid, coherent story. The writing is good, and the play could have been great. Of course, a bad Miller play is better than most authors' good works. Read it if you enjoyed The Crucible and Death of A Salesman, but otherwise stick with his more notable works."
17092,0,A painful play to write and to see,"Arthur Miller, having divorced actress Marilyn Monroe and married photographer Inge Morath, and in the aftermath of Monroe's still-controversial death, wrote this as part catharsis and part explanation of the recent events in his past. Treating Monroe as it does, it inspired a groundswell of revulsion for Miller that after forty years has not fully abated.Nonetheless, this is a fascinating work that on its own merits has some appeal."
17093,0,Excellent Book For Beginners,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the various types of keno tickets. I was disappointed to find quite a few spelling and grammatical errors. I would recommend the book for beginners and for those players who are wanting to learn about ""way"" and ""combination"" tickets."
17099,0,disappointed,"I, too, thought that there would be songs on this CD which were featured on the show. They could have at least had sandi patty sing I'll Fly Away like she did in the 4th season. I also saw the commerical and it said that it featured a song by the ""Gaither Vocal Band"", but they don't have any songs on this CD. So, I was rather disappointed"
17102,0,Not exactly what I was expecting...,"This is not exactly what I was expecting. I really like that it has a piece for every single state (that was why I bought it) but it does not have a primary board in which to put all of the pieces. You just lay this stencil on a piece of poster board-like paper, which has all of the states names on it and the stencil keeps sliding around. Really wish I hadn't bought it and cannot discover this until you open the entire package. I wish the pieces at least had their abbreviations on the each piece b/c once you lay it over the name of the state (on the poster-board paper) and put it all together you cannot study the names of each state."
17106,0,Accurate But Not Responsive,"It's very convenient to set this tuner to Bb while tuning a Bb clarinet.If you try to tune each note slowly, it gives you very accurate reading. However, if you play a few consecutive notes(not fast, just normally), it may show the first note and not move to the next, even when I set it to Fast."
17112,0,"Good, but could have easily been better","The choice of Generals to review did span much of recorded history, but huge chunks of history were missed. The first third of the book covers only 3 generals in all of recorded history up to 1800. Then the rest of the book (disporportionaly) covers the last 200 years. The review of campaigns was interesting, but some maps showed the flow of battles and others seemed to just be filler. The final two chapters on Rommel and MacArthur were done in too much detail. It became a deluge of unit identifiers and was hard to follow. All the recounts prior to these last two included not just historical review of engagement, but included analysis of what made the generals great -- not the last two recounts. I completely missed why reviewing and repreatedly reminding the reader of MacArthur's grand failure made him a great General? Finally, why were no naval and aviation generals included? Perhaps the book should have been ""How Some Great Generals Won Some Ground Wars""."
17125,0,Who knew that this movie would have subtle humor?,"BASEketball has its regular share of pratfalls and sight gags, and twice as many one-liners. When I recently rented it, these were expected and, as I was in the mood that day, welcomed. Where I really laughed, though, was when the humor went more subtle.A good movie fan will love when Parker and Stone, trying to save a child in a hospital, pause to bounce movie lines off one another. The chemistry between the two, best friends in real life, shows through--even with a script that doesn't get as cerebral as ""Airplane!"" or ""The Naked Gun"". (Yes, I said ""cerebral""...) The real humor in BASEketball comes out when these two very funny guys seem to be ad-libbing, whether or not they really are.Funniest effort by Parker, Stone, or director Zucker? Certainly not. Worth a viewing for some gut laughs? Certainly."
17127,0,Heavy on the Gloss,"Yet another of Francois Sagan's chic, sleek, and shallow sudsers. Sagan has always examined the sins, immoralities, and weaknesses of privalged parisians, and 'La Chamade' is no exception. Basically, it's style striving for substance. Does it acheive it? No. Is that okay? Yes. 'La Chamade' is an agreeable distraction as it features a Love vs. Money storyline played out against swinging 60's Paris (with a side trip to the Mediteranian!). Catherine Deneuve looks stunning (as always) in a series of late 60s haute couture, the characters thrash about in gorgeous settings, and drive great cars. It's everything one would have watched 'Dynasty' for, however, as the film is in french the subtitles allow you to feel slightly superior and not so guilty for enjoying it!"
17129,0,Lonesome Dove The Series,This series was o.k. but it was hard coming from the original movie and actors and watching the story continue. Some of the episodes were very interesting while others were very predictable.
17131,0,Strange BUT Interesting!,"The title simply states, Strange BUT Interesting, and that rings true. Matt Riddlehoover's performance was creepy and yet very appealing. Mr. Riddlehoover is very good looking, has an outstanding body, and is perfect for the main role. The story in itself is twisted but entertaining, yet weak at the same time."
17133,0,Yakuza by one of the masters,"I have seen two of Fukasaku's major works (the first being Battle Royale and Battles without Honor and Humanity the second) prior to this movie. And if I had watch this before one (or both) of these, I would probably gave it a higher score. But, it is a bit light compared to those two. That is not to say there isn't anything to scoff at.It has interesting camera work, biting black humor (with a dash of social commentary), and a passion for youth. It is a wonderful film for someone wanting a bit more in Yakuza films"
17135,0,Bleak And Uninspiring,"Four lonely characters center their lives around a deaf mute, Mr. Singer, who functions amidst them like a tabula rasa onto which they project whatever they need. None of these other characters has an ability to connect in a deep and meaningful way with their peers. In seeking Singer out, they project their needs onto him, and assume he understands them in ways no one else does, while he remains virtually unknown. Meanwhile, he is deeply connected to another deaf mute, who was committed to an asylum. Singer's devotion to his friend, who in many ways is as obnoxious an individual as Ignatious T. Reilly (Confederacy of Dunces)is completely baffling.There is a horrid sense of life passing by these characters and of them being cheated by life.It was too fatalistic and depressing for my taste, without nearly as much craft as Richard Yates (Revolutionary Road)."
17138,0,okay,I found the storyline too meandering with not enough substance. It was not a gripping page turner. The characters were oddballs and not terribly interesting oddballs at that. I'm very surprised this was one of Oprah's picks. It was definitely one of the more tedious choices from Oprah's list.
17144,0,required summer reading,"This was required summer reading for my teenage son. It is easy to follow the story and the language is everyday, but the story is depressing. He never would have chosen this on his own. And if I were in the library thinking about borrowing it, I probably wouldn't."
17147,0,Regarding the Audio Version,"The story is tightly written and very insightful. The characters are well developed. If I were rating the book, I would give it five stars. However, I chose the audio edition, which does not do justice to the book. The reader makes all of the characters sound drunk. Her Southern and Black accents are terrible. Her voice is so shrill and jarring that I have to continually readjust the volume. If you can't manage the book version, skip it altogether."
17149,0,"Challenging maybe, but a fine work nonetheless","I usually don't post reviews, but I felt compelled to speak up about this particular work. Given all the negative reviews - some of which characterizing this as the ""work book ever"" - you may be tempted to pass this one by. Don't.Literary masterpiece? I don't know about that, as few works really live up to that title. And this book *is* challenging to read, and it *is* depressing. But those two criteria are not an argument for not reading a book.I found this book, above all else, to be very real and very moving. The style is at times opressive, but also at times a bit charming. I've not read anything else quite like it, and I'm very glad that I spent the time on it.You may be too, and at the very least, this is one book worth making your own judgement about."
17162,0,Not as good as others,"This album isn't a patch on any other Pearl Jam album.Pearl Jam can do better.I'd reccomend any other Pearl Jam album instead of this. Don't bother listening to anyone who rated this 5 stars, they havent a clue. I reccomend Yield or Riot Act instead of this. They have a similar sound but are 10 times better.Yield is the better of the two."
17180,0,"Ultimately, the worst album of the 7.","Pretty much considered the worst of Pearl Jam's albums, and I would have to agree with that. While its not a horrible album, I'd have to say that almost half of it doesn't do anything for me. While the slow burners and ballads work, (""light years"" ""Nothing as it seems"",""Insignificance"", ""thin air"") other then ""Breakerfall"" and ""Grievance"" none of the other rockers did anything for me. ""Breakerfall"" had that loose ""Do the Evolution"" feel and ""Grievance"" sounded like it was right out VS, but other then those 2, none of the other rock songs had the energy that you'd expect from the creators of Ten, Vs, Vitalogy. 3/5 stars"
17182,0,Pearl Jam...Do The Evolution,"Peral Jam is still evolving its soud with Binaural. It isn't Vs or Ten, but it is more intimate like yield. There are some heavier songs...ten like..., but all in all they are mellower. It has taken me a few spins to try and get used to their post Neil Young era. The disc is an experience, not aout one individual song. Keep that in mind, but make sure you add this disc to your collection if you are a true fan."
17189,0,Do not buy if ..,.. You have tasted client service before. I found this book to be very basic. I have been on client cervicing side before and didn't find anything interesting to note.I would rather read a book which has all that this book has and much more.Not a great buy !
17192,0,A Good First Effort,"This album would've gotten a higher rating were it not for some mediocre songwriting and the song Bob Dylan, which is pretty bad. If you overlook those two aspects, though, the album is pretty good. It's packed with catchy tunes and it includes a wide range of musical styles. If I Am, Wanna Be, and Absolutely (Story of a Girl) are the standout tracks. I know Absolutely fell victim to TV and radio overkill, but I'm not a big MTV watcher or radio listener, so it's still pretty fresh to me.As an example of what I mean by mediocre songwriting, here's a line from the song Wanna Be:""...and I hate to say still I sway brown your eyes gone away...""If anybody can interpret that for me, I'd appreciate it."
17194,0,"Good, but lacks greatness","I loved ""Absolutly (Story of a Girl)"" the first few times that I heard it. When I got this Cd, though, it didn't seem as great and got old soon. Although the other songs are ok and complete the Cd, they will never make big hits. I was glad that I bought it, but it isn't one of my favorites."
17195,0,Two Great Songs,"When Nine Days hit the mark, they're truly enjoyable--kind of a mix between Buffalo Tom and Third Eye Blind. Big hooks and great production.Here, that happens twice--on ""So Far Way"" and ""Story of a Girl"".So, if you're a fan of white boy power pop, and two songs is enough to justify the price, go for it, dude."
17207,0,"Stretching it with ""Classics of Rock"" - Reyna Sion, critic at large - Riverdale, New York","This review is going to be short but maybe not so sweet. Rod, I easily fit into the category of ""one of your biggest fans"". You are such a high energy performer and this usually comes through on the CDs you've made. But and this is a big but, you sound bored and therefore you become boring to those of us listening to this. The selection of songs is ok, but nothing great, and does not do justice to some of your singing qualities. Please, don't even think of making a second volume of this."
17215,0,Not the best introduction to Rigoletto,"Rigoletto is a wondeful opera that can be used as an introduction for beginners who want to explore the art of operas. Although I like the concept of Black Dog Opera Library that provides an attractive book and recording of a famous opera in a bargain price, I cannot recommend this book of Rigoletto. The major drawback lies in the recording that accompaies this book. I would say it is probably the most disappointing Rigoletto ever recorded by big names in the opera world."
17245,0,Time for you to go... everyone's asleep!,"Just reading the set list conjures up the lyrics to ""MTV""... guys, it's the new music that keeps you exciting... We already have the 218 DVD's you've released with the older songs on them! Throw us a bone here..."
17255,0,Good first try,"Glad this was only $1.99 to view. It was a great first hunt for someoneinexperienced. Was expecting more, but the best part was the creepylaugh at the Prospect Place.

Good luck on your future endeavors."
17261,0,Nativity in Black II - One Of Best Tributes In World,"This Edited Version do not lose nothing for the original version. NIB II have the best band's of heavy metal: Soufly, Slayer, Pantera and Megadeth but the first tribute continue the best Sabbath tribute."
17266,0,"Good, but too technical.","Red Storm Rising is a good book, but it could have been better. I enjoy a good war novel, however, there were many acronyms which were either unexplained or explained much later. Too many characters are described in depth, only for the reader to find out that after reading a 2 page description of ""whoever"" that they won't ever hear about him again. The Hunt for Red October was much better, but the best Clancy is Without Remorse."
17271,0,Help for husband,I bought this book to help my husband. He really liked the book but it didn't help as much as I had hoped it would.
17286,0,Cut Off Image,"I ordered the wood poster. It's nice, good quality. The actual image is cut off though. It's missing some scenes, one of my favorites at that. Very disappointed in that. It's like a memory being cut off."
17291,0,Decent.,"I have always been interested in intelligence. I have always been a wiz in school, I never study anything I guess I just have a good memory. I always wondered why I was this way and why others weren't. I don't remember doing anything special as a kid besides playing an instrument, which the author touches upon. However I see no evidence that his methods work, no studies except one done by a Physics professor. There's really nothing scientific about what he's done. I think that maybe your intelligence can be improved slightly, but not in the monumental proportions that this guy is talking about.The book appeals to most of the population who have trouble in school and who are looking for a quick fix. I seriously doubt that Image Streaming does anything but increase visualization. If Dr. Wenger can provide adequate evidence that his method works then great. However until then I will remain skeptical about his work."
17298,0,A little disappointed,"The item was as described, however, I was disappointed that I had to cut-off about an 1/8"" at the end of each 12 iches to make a continuous ruler that was accurate. Still, it was a decision I made because this was cheaper than some of the alternatives and I didn't want to spend much on my project."
17304,0,more jazz and less jive,"A bit disappointing compared to Israel Lopez's recent recordings. Instead of surrounding ""Cachao"" with authentic Cuban musicians this recording, and its sequal-volume 2- is jazz oriented to a piano trio and altho the music is not poorly performed, it never reaches the red hot ""ritmos caliente"" beat nor feature any guitar or horn accompaniments that blow the music up into the Sun."
17311,0,Bum Lasers!,"I tried out the lasers when I opened the box but when I tried the gray laser it didn't do a thing. But the red laser worked fine for a little but then,it too stopped working. Now the game is completely useless. I don't roccomend this game."
17313,0,Chasing Darkness,"The author provides interesting details in the leading to the resolution of the mystery involved. It did provide a few tense moments; however, I did not find the details to answer the ""why"" to any degree of satisfaction. It was enjoyable reading, but not sure I'd label it a 'psychological' thriller."
17316,0,The same old stuff,"If you already have a lot of the old Johnny Cash albums this CD is not very interesting. It is just some more 'greatest hits' of which many have already been released on other 'Best of' CDs. I give it 3 stars for the 'first time on cd' songs like Jacob Green, Man in White, and Orleans Parish Prison and then the special liners notes."
17319,0,"Foster has witten some great books, this isn't one of them","Every so often Allan Foster turns an idea into a book that doesn't quite make it, It's a well crafted book and readable, but the plot isn't one of his best.A nice read but not up to Fosters usual high standard."
17321,0,A bit disappointing,"I bought the toy for my 4-year old son, who already have played a lot with BRIO trains. But the Action Locomotive arrived defective: the noise and light worked, but the machine did not. Amazon.com replaced the toy. Although this time it worked fine, I realized that the locomotive was not capable of climbing bridges, which was very frustrating for my son. And frustrating for me was the fact that the batteries last only a couple of hours of (non-continuous) playing. I have to replace them every 3 or 4 days!"
17325,0,Just OK Flavored Coffee,"A sample of these Van Houtte ""French Vanilla K-Cups"" were included with my Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System and it was fairly disappointing to me. This seems to be a ""hit-or-miss"" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.When made on the ""Large Cup"" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.CFH"

Wouldn't it be nice to actually see a few of the illustrations? I know what the original says. It's the pictures that make this edition much more expensive than the paperback version, so why not let me browse through a few here online? Guess I'll have to go to a bookstore (remember those?) and actually turn through the pages if this online offering won't show them to me."
17333,0,A little beat up,Overall it was a bit more beat up than I expected but still use-able. Worth the price I paid for it.
17341,0,The Religion of Nature,"I was rather disappointed in this book, perhaps due to it being written over 100 years ago and in Great Britain. It wasn't what I was expecting, but still a nice read about one person's view of religion and nature, for what it's worth."
17345,0,Cubans: The Ultimate Cigars,Good book and good info. I have kept this book and have it as a coffee table book now.
17346,0,Disjointed...,"One of The Catherine Wheel's great strengths is their general ability to offer albums' of consistency--CW weaves solid thematic and sonic textures that flow through albums such as ""Chrome"" and the incredible ""Adam and Eve"". With that, ""Wishville"" feels slightly disjointed, not sure of what it wants to be. If you're looking for hints of ""Ferment"" or ""Chrome"", this may not be the place. The best songs, ""Mad Dog"", ""All of That"", ""Gasoline"" are fantastic, but not really strong enough to carry the album. And even if this is their weakest album to date, it's still head and shoulders better than most bands on their best day."
17349,0,Plano Gun Case,"Well, it's a case. It does not come with any lock(s). Case can be easily broken into, but will detour kids from breaking in. Teenagers different story. Great for transportation. But if you're looking for security, get a safe.I'm not complaining about the product, for I simply need a case to transport my glock."
17353,0,Good not great,"First of all this is not a bad case. But you get what you pay for, and you don't pay a lot for this case. It gets the job done and it's very light. Great for Airsoft pistols. Note: The case I got was not ""pillared"". Didn't matter to me but just beware."
17355,0,single pistol case,It was necessary to return this product since it was not the model I hoped to receive. I searched for a particuar item by model number and received the single pistol case which was a different model number and half the size.When I ordered the case it was impossible to determine from the picture whether it was the right model.I ultimately returned the case and purchased another case from a local sporting goods store.
17370,0,Not the Best,"Great videos! But was unhappy with the narration. It was aimed at a grade school level, which would be good if purchased for that age level, but I'm 65! Will probably donate."
17371,0,implausable,"Great theme for this book, building and launching a star ship and Baxter goes out of his way to describe a possible 'star drive', but the scope of the theme ended up being too much of a reach for the author. Seriously folks, building and launching a starship when all that remains of your former nation is a soon to be overwhelmed archipeligo formed by the Rocky Mountains and just where does a country full of people go?The book did pose some interesting questions, how do you keep people sane for such a period of time as this sort of travel will take and what happens when you get there and it isn't quite right for colonization?"
17375,0,"unorganised, simplistic, full of errors","This text is definately not an 'upper level' text. It is poorly organized, essential theoretical information is left out, there are abundant, unexcusable errors, and the middle third of the book is essentially a waste of paper.The text starts off rather well, but the decision to move to derivatives, etc at the point they do and then back to a general reading on international organizations and then back again to more mathematical models is a bit odd.The information on different world events and world institutions, primarily in the middle third of the book, is written to an audience that could easily be a principles macro class.There are better books out there."

17396,0,Not an Easy Read for Lay People,"Very technical book about the art of physical relaxation, the release of residual tensions from the neuromuscular system of the body, including the mind. The author believed that the way to relax the mind was to relax the body. ""If the patient is shown how to relax the voluntary system, there later tends to follow a similar quiescence of the vegetative apparatus. Emotions tend to subside as he relaxes."" Relaxation must be cultivated until it becomes a habit, until it proceeds ""automatically with little or no clearly conscious direction."" Relaxation is ""the negative of doing.""This book has important insights to offer, but non-professionals will likely find it too technical, even unreadable at times. Perhaps boring or irrelevant to their needs. Chapters 4 to 6 are the meat of the book, the how-to chapters. They discuss the nature and technique of relaxation."

17405,0,Poor sound quality ruins a great album,"I am really confused by all the great reviews for this album. In my opinion, the sound quality on this record is terrible, which is a crime because I think the songs are some of Thursday's best. The whole album sounds muffled - like you're listening to it through cotton or like it's been copied several times. The vocals are nearly impossible to make out on almost all songs. I'd think I got a bad recording (though I bought the CD new at a major retailer) except a few other reviewers have pointed out these problems. I'm very disappoined in Thursday either way - either they purposefully released this mess or they allowed a record this poorly mastered to be marketed."

I had my own AV cable (red, white & yellow male ends). The port works. It is a very, poor quality plastic, but works. I'm using it for a Sony DVD player and a Nintendo Wii. I have them plugged into a new Vizio TV with a composite audio/video set up. It works with this set up. It's a good solution for to connect older technology with new electronics."
17411,0,enjoyable Saturday matinee fare,"Enjoyable adventure tale, obviously inspired by ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"". ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD (1986) was the sequel to 1985's surprise summer hit ""King Solomon's Mines"", again starring Richard Chamberlain as the gun-ho adventurer Quatermain with a fresh, young Sharon Stone as his spunky fianceé Jessie.The story finds Allan on the trail of his missing brother. Along the way, Quatermain and Jessie stumble across the mythical lost city of Gold, ruled by a power-mad High Priest (a particularly hammy turn from Henry Silva); and two buxom princesses (Aileen Marson and Cassandra ""Elvira"" Peterson).The special effects have dated horribly and the plot makes NO sense whatsover. THE LOST CITY OF GOLD won't challenge your mind but it offers a solid 95 minutes of entertainment...remember it?Grab the hot buttered popcorn and settle back."
17437,0,IT'S TOO BAD...,"I'd heard you were ""supposed to read this book"", and ""it's a classic"". So I went into it with open arms and to tell you the truth I loved Part 1. I couldn't put it down. Part 2 started to wane a little bit and by Part 3 I was forcing myself to go on. I've always felt that a great book, or a great movie should really leave you wanting more at the end, but with ""The Idiot"" that isn't the case. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Such a promising start, and such a dissapointing end.I think that because everyone says what a great book this is, we almost feel as if we too should think it's a great book. It's not. He's written much better stuff and so have other Russian authors."
17442,0,Didn't appeal to me,"I'm more into a different genre than this book. I thought it was really really boring. It probably didn't appeal to me because I don't have 11 siblings or 12 children and because it was set at a totally different time than I can relate to. Hardly anyone anymore has 12 kids! I thought that the parents had good intentions for having a big family, but to put that kind of pressure on them to skip school and hope that your younger sibling didn't skip to your grade wasn't the best idea."

17453,0,A Retro Romp,"I enjoyed this game. It's graphics and gameplay are old compared to today's, but it is entertaining. I could figure out most of the problems after a couple of hours. It also lets you appreciate how far gaming has come in a few short years. I usually go for the FPS type of games and sometimes need a break. This game is great to sit back, have a cold one, and go on a little trip without stressing out. I recommend it. Good, old fashioned fun."

17461,0,Fairly Pleased,We are pretty pleased with this item. It cooks slightly unevenly but it is little and easy to take places. The ignition starter didn't work from the start so that has been kind of annoying. But other than that we are pretty happy with it.
17464,0,Sinuhe's story,"Although this book is supposed to be one of the best books ever written by a Finn, I don't really go along with this. It's definately not a book for ""all ages"", more like for people ages 40->. Me, being 15, reading the book at 13, found it good but a little bit too long-winded. True, once you start you can't stop, but you won't get a good feeling after it. When I came to the ending, I had a feeling of ""What? That's all?"". Some of the parts could have been said in fewer words, while some of the parts were not as much as touched upon. Not recommended for those people looking for slightly more action in a book. If you want Egyptian style and don't like long-winded books, go for Christian Jacq's Ramses."
17477,0,Interesting but philosophically/scientifically controversial,"Truth or falsity cannot be verified in any way knowable to us as human beings. Meaning is subjective. True objectivity doesn't exist.To that end, I feel this book only has value insofar as a ""spiritual"" person could pick it up and convince him/herself that this is a new philosophy on life-- an awakening! However, please realize that accepting this man's ""research"" as being scientifically and empirically rigorous is pretty ridiculous from the viewpoint of the popular and academic majorities. If science is the modern religion, believing this ""study"" is heretical."
17478,0,Fun exploration of possible meaning in water,"This illustration of photographic water crystals taken under different conditions explores and proposes meaning to the shape of the crystals themselves. The hypothesis suggests that water is a medium of communication and that this is closely aligned to human health and well-being by the fact that humans are at least 70% liquid creatures. The publisher's corporate mission is to ""inspire to integrity"" and the material in this book does this while trying to integrate common sense and even some astrophysics. I consider it a worthwhile read from a personal philosophical exploration of our human species. It is a fanciful and energized continuation of Charlie Ryrie's ""The Healing Energies of Water"" ( 1999)."
17489,0,Would've been a good novel but the best part wasn't written.,"This novel picks up with Hornblower relinquishing command of the Hotspur and returning to London for a new command. As typical in a Forester novel, nothing ever goes as planned and action follows Hornblower on his way home from a supply ship. There are only about 150 pages of text in this story and what was missing in the story were what Hornblower did that lead to the eventual decisive Battle of Trafalgar. It was nice to see what Forester wrote anyway only because I like the genre and I like Forester's details and descriptions of being in the Service and living during that time. But this book wouldn't be good on its own."
17502,0,I passed the A+ Exam...,"This book is ok to study with,however, do not waste your time studying the chapter on DOS memory because there were absolutely no questions on the exam. The primary focus of the A+ OS section Win NT/2000 and 9x.I have 2 big beefs with this book. First, the CD with test questions was impossible to install on my home computer. I'm not an idiot and I have a lot of experience working on computers so I know it wasnt a user error problem. Second, there is NO chapter ending summary and review questions in the book. Instead, you have to read entire chapters line by line and highlight the info you think is important. Which makes no sense if you have to cram right before taking the test.I recommend that you buy another A+ book in addition to this one. Maybe A+ for dummies for its conciseness. Also, subscribe to an A+ newsgroup."
17519,0,"Wonderful story, terrible formatting","I'm really torn over this one. On the one hand, it's great to have this classic book in a Kindle edition. On the other, whoever proofread this should find another line of work.The font formatting (italics, etc) is completely absent. The paragraphs are almost all mashed together. For every ten paragraphs in the original, this version gives us maybe one.If you've read this book many times, you can, perhaps, get something out of this version if you remember the book well. (Of course, you may find this version as heartbreaking as I did.) If you've never read the book, this will be a hard slog, and without Bradbury's carefully chosen pacing, a lot is lost.The story is easily five stars. The formatting for this version is one. Hence, three stars. Three stars which weep in a black velver sky, while circus tents grow, like mushrooms, in the dark.I hate typing these next four words: skip the Kindle version."
17539,0,Making some money off of his name,"So its a work of fiction, mostly. Some of MY motorcycle stories are better... At least he is makin money legit. The paper quality is as cheap as one can make and still call it a book. More a collection of short stories, most don't even involve ""Sonny"". Can't find a reason to rate it better but (if you are into motorcycle fiction) can't really rate it worse."
17542,0,Good for basic study..,More of a resource for quizzing on exam prep. It has some pointers on taking the NCE and hints that will be helpful.
17549,0,Basic Product,"Being a fan of this book, particularly older versions I was expecting a little more than what was received. The binding and presentation was plain, with only the book title noted on the spine, not the author. There's no index and the chapter titles aren't listed at the top of each page in the chapter. Overall, it is just continuous text cut and bound into two cardboard bindings. The delivery time was fine as well as protective packaging."

17564,0,ca va plus ou moins..,"This is a decent example of French rap, but certainly not the best. It lies somewhere in between Solaar for his pure, fun pop lyrics and NTM's hard core scene. It lacks a bit of character. Je suis plutot Parisien que Marseillais, donc c'est peut-etre ca (NTM over IAM)? There are a couple of decent songs- Une Femme Seule has good lyrics and comes straight from the haert. Je Danse Le Mia is a terribly tacky song that is popular among the FunRadio and Skyrock crowd. I saw a funny incident on french tv- IAM performed at an award show and after finishing said"" Attention- L'OM va mettre le feu ce soir"". The crowd got pumped up and cheered wildly. Pascal Obispo performed shortly after and said ""Moi, je suis bordelais et donc allez les girondins"". His soft quiet voice did not quite have the same effect and people clapped politely.By the way, OM est dans la merde cette saison..."
17571,0,Expected more,"After 3 days I did notice a difference. However, thinking my teeth were going to continue to get whiter over the next couple days, but they did not. I was expecting way more. I feel like my teeth are already almost back to their normal color and it's only been a few weeks and I am not a smoker/ wine drinker. Next time I want to whiten my teeth I think I'll just save me time and go to the dentist to have them done."

I insalled a older 110 fan and made it work. poor job on the rectifer. they changed from 110v to the 12 v fans because it was cheaper. after this I hope it last as long as my old 30 year charger.
17584,0,Not as good as the other seasons,"I watch The L Word since it's debut on TV, and I have to say that the 4th season is by far the weakest one. All other seasons had an intensity, a passion and were very interesting to watch while this 4th season had a lack of that. In the last episode I was still waiting for the season to get more dramacity, more intensity and suddenly it was the last episode. It felt like 2nd or 3rd episode. The acting still wonderful though!Now I'm looking forward for the 5th season, which I've heard it's gonna be great!"
17585,0,After Season 1-3 I found it a bit boring.,"I loved to watch Season 1-3 and so I was a little disappointed of what happened - or rather not happened - in Season 4.Before I even noticed, I watched the last show and it was over.The good:I especially liked that Shane is taking care of her brother. And that Bette and Tina get along better is very nice to see.What I really liked was the story around Tasha, the military girl. The conflict she is in shows how stupid the war is and what it does to people.The bad:What's up with Jenny and why are they still talking to her? She is putting out everyone's life in The New Yorker and even makes it into a book with the worst phantasy in names.Why is Tina, being back to the heterosexual crowd suddenly an outcast?The story around Helena is so ridiculous, I was tempted to forward...All in all I am looking forward to Season 5."
17590,0,"Exciting, But Not Terribly Informative","As someone who has been involved in Russian legal matters for the past ten years, I found this book quite interesting, if not always accurate. It is not so much that it is inaccurate with respect to what it reports, it is that it so much sensationalizes Russian business that it ignores the great multitudes of Russian businesses that are out there slogging it out just like most businesses in the West. So while I greatly enjoyed the book from a mostly prurient perspective, I did not find it terribly helpful in improving my knowledge of Russian business."
17592,0,Despicable Russians,"Despicable RussiansI think Mr. Zbignev Brzezinski - a former US National Security adviser under President Jimmy Carter - would certainly enjoy the book. After all, `Casino Moscow' was written by his young and talented nephew - Matthew. Plus it portraits Russia in the most unattractive light - what a feast for an old Russophobe! Certainly, to his credit, Mr. Matthew Brzezinski has reached new heights in his creative Russia -bashing. The author has actually moved a full circle from his uncle's typical Truman-like anti-communism to the more traditional and age-old loathing of everything Russian by the Polish right-wing aristocracy. I am not sure if this loathing is unjustified, the question I am asking is simple: is he really a right person to represent US business community in Russia (as a WSJ correspondent), or may be he is a little biased to bridge Russian and American business interests? No wonder US investments in Russia are less than in Costa Rica."

17599,0,+ 1/2 Stars...Charming British Folk,"I discovered Martin Carthy through Steeleye Span, a band he played in off and on throughout the Seventies. Carthy's work with that band, however, did not entirely prepare me for this solo album first released on Rounder in 1974. It is truly a solo recording with Carthy accompanying himself only on guitar--and on two numbers he sings a capella: ""Mary Neal"" and ""John Barleycorn,"" the latter in a version that will not be recognizeable to those who know it only by way of Traffic or Jethro Tull. Carthy is an accomplished British folksinger/guitarist and while he may not display the same virtuosity on guitar as Bert Jansch or John Renbourn in terms of fancy fretwork, each of these ten traditional songs have a warmth and charm about them. [If ten tracks seems a bit short, three of these songs run in excess of six minutes each.] For those who like their folk music traditional and uncomplicated, this will satisfy you more than adequately. RECOMMENDED"
17604,0,moderate sequel,"Note that this was reprinted in 1996 together with ""Janissaries 2: Clan and Crown"" by Baen as ""Tran"".This book is not in the same class as ""Janissaries"" (1), but still is a pageturner. A bit spoiled by intrigue of the nasty sort."
17607,0,Garmin Nuvi 670,Overall a decent product. Has some shortcomings but this review is limited at this point to the German region. We have noted sometimes a delay with acquiring a satellite signal. The roundabouts are not clearly shown and maps are not fully updated for some of the areas we have been too. Real view is not an option that I can tell and we truly miss this feature found in the Navigon and most Asian navigation systems. The price was decent so I can't really complain. However I would have to see a dramatic improvement in the software to buy another Garmin.
17611,0,Problems with the camera,"When I first started playing this game, I was enjoying it. However, after about an hour of playing, I started to feel nauseous. I quit and went back the next day and again felt nauseous. I tried a few more times, but discovered that the camera which shifts around was the cause, so I was not motivated enough to continue playing. My children did not seem to experience the same problem and really enjoyed the game."
17612,0,Could Have Been Better.,"Deception, envy, and greed divide the Blackwoods, a powerful Ohio family. Whose land-rich empire grows to dramatic proportions despite a soap opera of sibling rivalry. The script could have had more depth, and it ended in a flat, incomplete manner. Far too many loose ends. Despite this flaw I give it 3 stars because Sarah Miles and Stacey Keach were good."
17614,0,So-so experience,"I bought both the shampoo and conditioner because I am trying to grow my hair out. I have used this product before for the same reason and decided to give it a second try. I have been using both on a daily basis for about a month now, and have formed a so-so opinion on it. My hair does appear thicker after using Mane 'n Tail, but my hair isn't as silky and smooth as it used to be. I noticed that my hair is harder to brush and it gets knotted much faster. However, I think my hair is growing faster than it used to. My hair grows very slowly, and I noticed about a half inch increase in my hair length after using this product. If you are looking to grow your hair, I would highly recommend this product. If you are just looking for a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, then I would advise not to buy this product. My hair is far less manageable."
17624,0,Hammering in what everyone knows,Gordon Bethune certainly turned around Continental by using common logic and Management techniques. What is not clear is how did Continental slip to such depths before and also what are the Challenges that still need to be overcome ? The book is interesting but one tends to jump pages since there is a lot of repetition. All the same it is a good book for it does hammer in that PEOPLE COUNT and one cannot ignore that.
17626,0,Review for the Blackberry battery,"I recieved the package well on time, however when i recieved - it was rather small in size and unlike the Black berry original 8820 battery. In any case - Its not much of a hazzle - the battery still works with my bb 8820.Thanks"
17628,0,working at the zoo,"The book was okay.But it was also quite interesting.Elizabeth,who was excited about working at the zoo,wasn;t having such a great time.But Jessica,that didn't even want to work at the zoo in the first place loved working with the bears later on.But the book itself was alright,even though it was sad at the end."
17638,0,Defects Abound!,"I bought the first DVD and it had a flaw that would freeze the movie up. Amazon sent a replacement copy, same problem...seems the folks pressing the DVD in Mexico have made a big ol' batch of garbage DVD's, so I will not get a replacement copy. Hold on to your money and wait for a good run of DVDs', then you can watch a great car/entertainment movie, followed by a so-so one, and the b-side (3rd ""Smokey"" movie) can be used as a coaster for your soda."
17645,0,So bad it's funny.,"Death Wish 3 has to be a parody, nothing can be this stupid and be meant to be taken seriously.Paul Kersey returns to New York just has the old war buddy he is going to visit is beaten to death by thugs. Of course the cops think Kersey did it and arrest him. The precinct captain (Ed Lauter!) recognizes Kersey and hires him to snuff out bad guys. High/low point is when Kersey guns down a mugger (called The Giggler) on a crowded street and every one of the dozens of witnesses cheers and applauds as triumphant music swells.This HAS to be a parody of Death Wish. Director Michael Winner could not have meant for this to be taken seriously. Could he?"
17658,0,Well written with some slow spots,"Andrew Sinclair obviously knows his material and I found the book excellenty researched with tons of facts, names and dates. it did tend to drag sometimes but never for any long period of time. My only problem with the book is that the author tends to dismiss some alternative theories a little too easily."
17661,0,just ok,This organizer is ok but it could be better. The largest compartment on the bottom is not large enough to hold a standard Rand McNally road map. It does not stay attached on the bottom of the seats all that well either. Not as great as I expected it to be.
17674,0,Slow read.,"It's hard to stick with this one. There's not much of a plot to draw you from chapter to chapter, and as instructional material, it drags out too much. Given learning as the objective for reading it, I'd rather just read something that cuts to the chase in a more overt, efficient, instructional manner.If you ever wondered what a friendly, open, unassuming neuroscientist or neurosurgeon might sound like if there were such a thing, you might read this to indulge that fantasy ;) These two authors have gone to great lengths to make their world accessible, which is a much appreciated effort by those of us in allied fields."

17692,0,My first book for my Kindle,"First of all I have to say that English is not my first language and that is the reason why I gave this book a 3 star rating, it was a little hard to read because it is written in an old fashioned way that I am not used to. Another thing that kinda made the book less enjoyable (and this is not the author's fault) is the fact that there's been a lot of pirate movies lately and most of them seem to resemble certain parts of the book, I guess if I hadn't seen the movies that wouldn't have been an issue. Overall I'd say that it is a very good book and great for young people to start to get to know the classics."
17696,0,Shiver me soul,"This book is at turns dreadfully dull and blood-poundingly enthralling. Be prepared to plow through the mire of overly detailed passages relating tactical events to get to the great character-building climaxes. The people in this story were to me so much more interesting than the plot.It may be my own deficiency that I wasn't able to enjoy the action in this adventure story, but it seemed to drag on and on, and many times I had to force myself to re-read paragraphs to understand the development of a situation. When it comes to the characters in the book, however, I am transported to a movie set in my mind. I appreciate the impact this book has had on swashbuckling tales and our perception of pirate culture. For that we are indebted to Stevenson's imagination. I'd just rather see the film."
17701,0,Classic,Another classic book that is a good ready and takes me back to child hood when I first read it
17706,0,Awesome - but not for long,"I bought these immediately when I saw them for sale in a surf shop. It comes with a little funnel to make filling the flasks easier. I kept them filled with whiskey, and there were several times when it came in handy, especially after parties, or when the bars closed and I was walking home (lol). Plus, it's pretty funny to pull off your shoe while your at a store or something and pour whiskey out of the heel into your mouth (kind of gross, but a great conversation starter). The flask broke after about a month - I noticed a small puddle of whiskey at my feet while in a restaurant. The shoes were pretty comfy though...those lasted a while. I figure they're about the same price as regular Reef's, why not just buy the Drams?"
17709,0,Originally immersive,"3 1/2Compositionally competent enough to ignore the spawning of a thousand sub-par, new-aged, synthesized relaxation discs, Arkenstone's debut promises electric vibrancy for those willing to disassociate what his pioneering sound had been made into afterwards."
17710,0,Smells good at first...,"I bought this product because I was really taken by the unique fragrance. It was the smell of cake with something fruity in it. However, as I wear it, the frutiness of the scent fades and it seems to smell just like a regular french vanilla perfume.If you're a Britney fan then I recommend it. If you're not (like me) I recommend ""Provocative Interlude"" by Elizabeth Arden. It smells very similar, but has a more fruity/floral side to it which lasts all day. No difference in price, unfortunately."
17725,0,"Good choice of material, but quite sloppy","The book contains very interesting choice of material, but the derivations are quite sloppy, the notation frequently changes without warning, and there is huge amount of typos. This is a kind of book that gives you some good insights (aka Feynmann's books), but certainly not the book from which you can seriously learn the subject."
17730,0,Refused,"For anyone trying to find the other music from the film not featured on the instramental soundtrack, go buy the Refused - The shape of punk to come CD. This CD features the Final game intro song titled New Noise. Refused is pretty old school so I am happy they got this opportunity to be in this film, too bad the Soundtrack went in the direction it did.""Can I Scream"""
17735,0,Great for awhile....,"As many others have said, this brewer is great until it starts half-cupping. I spend about 1/2 the morning sticking paper clips into the nozzle to no avail. I guess the pump gives out. Has to be replaced about every year."
17740,0,Great when it works,This machine makes great coffee but has been replaced once under warranty and is again not pumping out coffee as it should every time. Works about 50% of the time now. I do de-scale on a regular basis but I suspect that it is the pump that is not working correctly as I hear it turn off when it stops working.I'm looking for a more reliable model.
17741,0,The short truth,"Here's how is goes. It's very simple. This is a nice looking machine that is incredibly easy to use, very convenient, saves me a lot of time, that is easy to fill and clean. Truly revolutionary.However, be prepared to drink some awful coffee over the next few months. It has nothing to do with the coffee makers... I think it is a flaw in the way that water brews through, the speed, dilution, etc. Yet to try Dunkin' Donuts own brand (which were annoyingly pulled from everywhere - supposedly can only buy in-store - no go in Nor Cal).So there you go... Short and sweet..."
17745,0,RIP Keurig,"I enjoyed my Keurig B70 for the two years that it was alive. It would stop working and then I descaled it with Dezkal which worked wonders. This time however, nothing could bring it back to life. I tried three rounds of descaler even leaving it overnight. I tried the paperclip. Nothing but the terrible sounds of what seemed like the pump dying. I spent hours trying to revive it but I am declaring my Keurig dead now. My only consoling thought is that this was a Christmas gift from two years ago so I didn't have to be upset about paying so much money for it. Now I have to make the decision: Electronics recycling or a Free on Craigslist ad..maybe someone knows how to actually fix this thing.The Keuring is wonderful when it works...just take into consideration the price and perhaps buying it somewhere that offers extended warranties. I usually don't get those but considering the reputation of these machines failing soon after warranty, I think it would be worth getting one."
17751,0,not strong enough,"I got this with a free my-K-cup accessory and a bunch of the little pre-filled plastic cups. It was intended to solve the Royal Family Coffee Crisis that occurs in the mornings due to my, the King, and the Princess of Noirs' caffeine habits that must be fed at the same time with limited brewing capacity. Now, I think that the packaging and discardable component of the little pre-filled cups is disgraceful, so I use the my-K-cup accessory filled with Peets. Here's another parameter to consider: The Noir Family exclusively drinks Peets coffee at home, and we make it dark enough to repair blown tires. I should have known that this brewer was not going to do it for us. The device is quick and makes a hot cup. It looks great with it's blue light shining through the water reservoir but even set to dispense the tiny cup of liquid through a fully filled K-cup holder with Peets dark roast it does not make a cuppa that enables me to drive safely."
17753,0,Overpriced and poorly designed.,"After having used this for almost 2 years and being on my 3rd replacment from Keurig, i will never buy another one of these peices of junk. I would much rather have my old 12 cup coffee pot back especially in the mornings, nothing like having to mess around with coffee for myself and my wives 2 cups before we go out the door and then our 2 travel mugs... If you only drink a little bit of coffee or want this for the other beverages on an occasional bsis, im sure it would be great...but to use this as a coffee machine,,, it doesnt last long enough or function quick enough. There is a design fault with this model, somehow the water corrodes a solenoid and the unit ceases to funciton..> Keurig knows about this and they replace the unit with not much hassle... i gave them 3 stars for customer service alone... the unit istelf would get a 1 or 2 IMHO"

17766,0,Coffee gets cold faster,"My only problem with it is that if I don't drink my coffee right away (like 5 mins), it gets cold and fast! The machine itself works great, no leaks, no fuss. All components are easy to remove and it's pretty easy to clean."
17768,0,Coffee not quite good enough.,Machine works great but the coffee just doesn't taste that good. Lots of options but no really great coffee (like Peet's or Starbucks).
17770,0,hearing loss after own keurig,I have two of these machines and if you can hear me right now you don't own one yet. I think the noise and vibration have caused me health issues. The machine works good and I use it everyday but buy a bulk package of foam safety ear plugs.
17778,0,Plano Protector Four Pistol Case,"Well constructed, although I would prefer a heavier material for the casing. The case actually fits three pistols ( 2 Ruger Vaqueros and a 1911 Semi Auto Pistol) a fourth would be too snug."
17782,0,"An expensive book, with pluses and minuses","I got some good ideas from the book, but I don't think they're worth either the $$ or the time it took to ferret them out. Now, I'm a life coach, not a financial advisor, so that may be part of the problem . . . BUT . . . Gregory refers readers to his tip-filled website and when you log on to it, there's no ""there"" there . . . no website, just the word that it will be coming along soon, and you can register to be kept up to date. He's also wedded to using the keyboard instead of a mouse, arguing that memorizing keyboard controls will cumulatively save you a lot of time. Again, maybe YES for financial advisors, but for a right-brained person, this is not helpful advice. So -- IMHO, the book is uneven. Browse at the library or a bookstore before buying."
17797,0,Just average,"Though I find this book about average, I am still glad I bought it. The stories in this book, seem to be more about good samaritans, making a difference in peoples lives, than angelic interventions. that said, I certainly found the book uplifting, if only little dry."
17801,0,"Good... Flawed, but nostalgic","This DVD is a decent collection of episodes. The transfer is not the best, but these are 80's cartoons, so they don't have much to work with. The audio hisses like crazy. I have no idea why I was so big into this cartoon, it's actually kinda bad, but it's nostalgic. It's fun to remember all the toys that I bought like a dumb American consumer. :) If you want M.A.S.K. on DVD, this is your only shot, so it's ""awesome"" I guess. If you simply like 80's cartoons, there are better out there."
17808,0,"Not as good as ""The Shining""","The first King novel that I read was ""The Shining"" and from that point i decided that I would become an avid reader of Stephen King. So when ""Dreamcatcher"" was released I did not hestitate in purchasing it.Overall, I felt this book was entertaining. Many times during the course of the reading, I found myself wanting to skip ahead a few pages to find out what happens next. King seems to overindulge the reader with long descriptions that cause the reader to lose sight of the novels story.Also, the action and the movement of the plot is inconsistent throughoput the book. We are introduced to the four friends and then introduced to the ""alien-like"" creature. At this point it seems as if the book was about to get increasingly interesting. However, I realized there was about 300 more pages of material to read.I would recommend this book if there is nothing else that you really want to read sitting on the end table."
17811,0,Insertion of personal political opinions diminishes the book,"This is much improved over the last several novels by Mr. King; It is exciting without being grotesque, entertaining without the inclusion of injuries and crimes against children, and certainly worth the time spent reading it and the money spent buying it; HOWEVER, Mr. King inserts a few of his own opinions regarding our last presidential election and these opinions detract from and diminish the book. Perhaps he is forgetting that half the voters in this country voted for each candidate, or perhaps he doesn't mind alienating half his readers. The fact is, Mr. King is an author, not a national leader or opinion maker or policy setter and if the public wants to know his political views, we'll ask. As for me, I've bought my last King novel."
17814,0,Not one of his best,"I am a big Stephen King fan. I love his ability to describe in such detail that you can picture every scene. This book was no different. I appreciate how he weaves his other books and ideas in some books. This one directly mentioned events from IT. He even mentioned Pennywise the clown. It was long and it really didn't add to the plot. I couldn't stop once I started, but I've enjoyed many of his other works much better. While it wasn't my favorite, it wasn't my LEAST favorite. If you are a Stephen King fan, you'll enjoy it."
17819,0,Wait for the paperback version,"What a disappointment. I read Bag of Bones, Hearts in Atlantis, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and the ebook The Plant. When I heard the title I got excited; I love the concept of dreamcatcher. After feeling the improvement in his writing style I just couldn't wait to read Dreamcatcher. It had everything you could ask for in a nightmare: Aliens, Boggymen, Crazy Army Brass, Plague, Chases. Once I started I realized it had a problem, the writing was lengthy. King was drumming his narative painfully slow. It was driving me up the walls. All I can say: ""Stephen get rid of the fountain pen."""
17824,0,Familiar Plot,"While Stephen King exhibits expert writing tactics, with vivid descriptions and creative plot twists, I cannot help but be reminded of Stand By Me. A good read, not his best work, but his worst either."
17825,0,"fast moving and pleasant read, HOWEVER...","I am only 1/4 done with this book right now and enjoying the ride. HOWEVER, I am getting tired of the same old plot tricks. How many times do we have to be relied upon to drop back and forth from childhood to adulthood, Mr. King? And also, Mr. King, you are getting sloppy with your story telling. One single point of contention: how can a bathroom door which two grown men ""rushed forward together...,almost four hundred pounds behind two dropped shoulders. It gave way with absurd ease..."" How can such a ruined door then be used to keep an enemy within? A man can hold a such a door shut by clutching the doorknob tightly? C'mon. Be real. Or be unreal. Just be constant."
17828,0,Good Read !,"I liked this book! I read this months prior to the release of the movie and I'm glad that I did. This one kind of played with my emotions, it began to lose me at times and then slowly pulled me back."
17829,0,Not his best work.,"I am a very big fan of Stephen king's novels and can honestly say that this book just isn't hapenning. The book starts very interesting but as you keep reading it gets more and more boring. If you are thinking of buying this book, you will be better off buying one of his other novels."
17830,0,Typical New King,"I found this novel to be consistent with most of King's work since 1992. I'm not sure what it is, but he seems to always start out extremely strong with excellent plot and character development only to fizzle out by the end of the book with a sub-par ending. This holds true for such books as Rose Madder, Insomnia, and Desperation. In Dreamcathcer, I was 300 pages in and still hooked, anxiously trying to determine where this story was taking me and the fate of the masterly-developed characters. By the end of the novel, the chase was on and I had lost interest and was desperately trying just to finish the book. Personally, I find King's best work to be those in which he doesn't stray to far from the norm."
17832,0,Long and winding road,"I'm a long time King fan. I've read most of his early stuff, but not much in the last few years. When Dreamcatcher was released and made into a movie, I thought I would give it a shot. IMHO, it's not the equal of King's earlier works. When I read a novel, I read for pleasure, so I read every word. At times I found myself scanning paragraphs and occasionally, entire pages, just to get through them. Overall, I enjoyed the story, but I can only recommend this book to hard core King fans."
17834,0,Dreamcatcher,"The book Dreamcatcher, by Stephen King, deals with the mind more than any physical trait. Even so, the plot jumps from place to place and left my head spinning. And man, some of the concepts that are stated in this book I have never heard of before. I couldn't really keep up with all of this and had trouble figuring out what was going on. Like the weasel like creature, I would have never thought of that in a million years. Stephen King has a great mind and putes it to use in this book."
17849,0,Below average for Mr. King,"In my opinion, Dreamcatcher is below average for Mr. King. The characters are not likeable; the plot is silly; and the book drones on and on. Indeed, had Mr. King shorted this book by 300 pages, it would have improved it.I'm a fan of Mr. King's writings, but this isn't a book I enjoyed."
17855,0,Alternately incredible and flaccid,"Often called the worst rock and roll record ever made, I bought this out of curiosity and was quite surprised. It's not half bad, once you get used to the out-of-tune guitars and wavering vocals. But some of the songs(like ""It's Halloween"" and ""Painful Memories"")have a special magic, a plaintive kind of nostalgic melancholy. My favorite track is the live ""Gimme Dat Ding"", which sounds like it was recorded at the YWCA on a busy summer afternoon(it was actually a town hall in New Hampshire). A very peculiar listening experience, but well worth it for fans of the bizarre."
17857,0,Not crazy about this purchase,"This is an old style key pouch with the key ring in side of it that you can transform into a coin pouch. Not exactly what I was looking for, but it does work O.K."
17859,0,Coin Pouch from Amazon is just ok,I recently purchase some pants that did not have a pocket to hold change. I needed something to hold my change.I did a search on Amazon and found these pouches. I ordered two of these and found them to be hard to open. The metal mechanism used to open and close the pouch does not work very well.I would not recommend this item.
17868,0,Interesting Read,"I bought this book for the sole purpose of getting Carnegie Deli recipes, particularly the brisket recipe. Turns out it is a really basic recipe you can get anywhere. Nice to have on the shelf though for reference."
17871,0,A hybrid that didn't quite work,"There were some scary and funny elements in this film, but there were not enough of either of them to highly recommend the movie. Brendan Fraser's performance annoyed me, probably because I had just watched ""Gods And Monsters"" a couple of days earlier. He had to act in that one. That wasn't a requirement for this film."
17874,0,Don't like the texture of it.,This is a bonded leather bible and I have realized that the imitation leather fabric has a better feel and look.
17881,0,Not exactly what I expected,"I was hoping this was a compilation of commentary and performances. Instead, it was mostly a commentary by various stars with very few snippets of performances.It's a great nostalgia piece for historical purposes, but not what I'd call entertainment. So, if nostalgia is your intention, this is a great buy, but don't expect performances."
17885,0,it was ok,"i purchased due to reviews on makeup alley.com but did not think is worth the money. Great color and packaging, that is it. Currently using Lancome waterproof concealer tube and that last all day- even after my lunch workout. I would not buy again."
17890,0,Endless Rebuilt for parents,I got this for my son last Christmas. It took about 2 hours to put together and about 2 minutes for him to rip apart. So I thought I would Krazy Glue it together. It did not work. I sold it at a garage sale for $10. Not worth the time to locate small pieces and rebuilt every night.
17891,0,Not Free SF Reader,"A pretty good kids book. The three children of a clan leader have psionic powers, or, at least, all come to discover that they do.They also have to deal with the feuds between their clans and others, as well as with the different non-human races that inhabit the same area."
17906,0,"Ok, as long as you don't know your history.","I thought that the movie had many interesting scenes, and the recostruction of what the pyramids would have looked like then was nice, however imhotep was a carpenter, not a priest. Anyway, that is one small error amongst several. Unfortunately I was taking egyptian history when this movie came out, which ruined the impact for me due to a few errors on the side of the movies historical accuracy. Oh well. Some of the computer effects looked downright fake as well, but some looked really good. That's all I have to say about that ;)."
17912,0,"Campy and cheesy, but had good special effects.","I first wanted to see this movie when I saw the ad for it during the Super Bowl. We had been studying Egypt in my history class, so I had wanted to go see how accurate it was to real life. The day it came out, my dad's friend saw it and said it was very lame. My dad told me that I should wait until it comes out on video to see it. A few months later, I picked up a copy at Blockbuster and watched it that night. I was hoping to see a non-stop, well-acted thrill ride, but instead, I saw a bad Indiana Jones rip-off. The plotline was very cheesy, the acting was terrible, and the movie is very confusing at times. The reason I gave this movie 3 stars is for the special effects. I had a good time at parts of the movie, but the best parts were shown on the trailer. Don't waste your money on this one.Here's a list of similar (and better) movies:1.Raiders of the Lost Ark2.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom3.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade4.Stargate"
17922,0,Rather stupid humor,"The visual effects were pretty cool, but the actors were stupid and their humor was stupid. 3 stars."
17933,0,"Really, really corny - but fun","This is one of the cornist, most hackneyed movies you will ever see. The jokes are miserably obvious and the director follows the truly annoying tactic of having the actors move in unison when grouped together. In addition to that, the plot besmirches one of the most revered figures in history - Imhotep, recorded history's first multi-disciplinary genius.All that having been said, the subject matter is interesting enough that one can actually have some fun watching it. Rachel Weisz's spritely performance has a lot to do with that, though. Without her, this movie would be DOA."
17937,0,Not For Egyptologists...,"...but everyone else should enjoy it. Okay, here's my problem.Great special effects, great chemistry between the two leads, lots of action, and lots of humor. So far, so good. But the opening scene takes place in ancient Thebes,and there's a Pyramid and the Sphinx. Perhaps I'm being a little nitpicky, but hello?!? The Pyramids and the Sphinx are in Giza. Then later,Evelyn is talking about the process of mummification, and she says ""...and then they take out your heart."" (which they would leave in). And there were five canopic jars when there should have been four. The list goes on. All these gaffes could be excused if the director didn't know any better, but from what I've read,he consulted with an Egyptologist for the film.I really enjoyed this movie when it first came out,but know I can't even watch it. What a bummer."
17942,0,cute,"Looks nice, small gauge. Was a bit more difficult to insert than my original, due to tighter loop. I like the fact that the post is shorter, so less of it ""shows"" inside your nose. It has a snugger fit, stays in well."
17943,0,left/right nostril (wrong nostril),"I wish I had checked the shape of my old nose screw because this one didn't fit me. :( Supposedly this jewelry corresponds to a left nostril piercing, but that is certainly not my experience. All the ""left nostril"" nose screws shown by Body Candy look like this item, but my own personal nose screw - that actually fits in my left nostril - looks like the ones they advertise as ""right nostril"" nose screws. I am perplexed!Aside from that, it is good quality but DOES look much smaller than its stated gauge. I got a s.steel nosering from the same company and it doesn't look as small, so maybe it's because it's gold. Not sure which nose screw to choose now..."
17945,0,"Excellent game, too many glitches","I love this game. I love all crime-solving games. However, the bugs and glitches made it very frustrating to play.In between scenes, the screen would remain black for several minutes, although the audio worked just fine. If it hadn't been for the glitches, I would have given this game 5 stars.When I first bought this game, I thought I got a bad disk because everything kept freezing up. I replaced the disk with a new one, and the same thing happened. I wanted to play the game, so I dealt with the bugs.If you are patient and don't mind waiting for the screen to unfreeze, go for it. It's a great game, great plots, great concept.Legacy Interactive is horrible about the video quality of their PC games, it seems."
17946,0,Great game...if you like bugs,"I think this game has the potential to be great. I like this style of game, and I usually have a great time trying to figure out the cases. This one seemed a bit easier than some of the other ones, and to be honest the extra features they are hyping so much don't really add to the game at all. I would recommend this game, after about 6 months. I would wait until they have patches available, because quite frankly it gets very irritating to have to stop and start so much because of the many many bugs. My game only crashed twice, which took forever to sort out, but the in-game bugs are horrible. They really really should've taken their time to release this, and I wonder if they even checked it out before they shipped it. I can't believe a manufacturer would ship a game so obviously bug filled."
17947,0,good but there's better,Decent collection. But nowhere as good as the incredibleCompact Jazz (Ella Fitzgerald/Louis Armstrong).They just don't seem quite as into it here.
17957,0,upclass snobs,I enjoyed the strength of Sara's character as other reviewers mentioned. But the story is the point of view of European wealthy colonists to Australia. I found that viewpoint tiring. Money and status and clothes and power seemed to be what was important -- that's what all Sara's strength of character got her. Lots of snobbery and classism.
17964,0,Probably only for younger children,"My daughter received this as a gift when she was about a year old and she really didn't seem too interested in it. Although it's very cute and durable, it might have been that she was too old for it."
17969,0,not to great after 12mo,"This toy kept my son entertained for a while when he was 9-12 months. After that he was more interested in stacking or pushing buttons. He does still play with the balls, throwing them at everything he can!"
17976,0,"An unfortunately average, yet commendable attempt.","In ""Company Business"", writer/director Nicholas Meyer makes a commendable effort to create a tightly plotted, top-of-the-line Hollywood thriller, but the whole affair unfortunately falls flat. Plagued with the need for constant re-writes (due to the changing political scene in Russia at the time) and a rather uncooperative lead by Gene Hackman (who wanted to bow out of production a mere two weeks before principle photography began), Meyer was left with a screenplay that only sort of makes sense and a film that only sort of works. Some sequences are a hit (e.g. the opening caper sequence and a tense exchange in the Berlin subway), while others... not so much. I still enjoyed ""Company Business"", it's just sad to know how much better it could've been."
17981,0,Watch Storage Box is a poor articulator,"The watch box itself is a beautiful piece of workmanship however for the price, the manufacturer should have spent a few more cents on hinges that hold the top open and a clasp that isn't so inexpensive. Hard to believe that a burled wood box as nice as this one chinces on the hardware."
17983,0,Something is wrong,The price was good so i bought a few of them. the shave is great for the first 3-4 times after that it needs to be replaced. never faced anything like that where you need to change the razor maximum every week if you shave every day.
17987,0,GOOD - BUT - Outrageously EXPENSIVE,"These Razors / Cartridges are of excellent QUALITY, but for a disposable item RIDICULOSELY EXPENSIVE...!!"
17991,0,"I like it, because it is cheaper than the same brand at the store...",This product is cheaper on Amazon than the store...however I find that in general these razors wear out very fast!It seems that I only shave my face 5 times and I need to replace it!Any suggestions on how to remedy this problem?
17995,0,Good solid,Not a thermal reallyMore like a warm topBut it kept me warm when I wore it with layersBut pricey
18004,0,"it's ok, but not as good as the black.","I bought it with the black one, this one feels like a different material, more uncomfortable, less ergonomic, more like a poliester than a Nylon.The colours are ok, and it doesn't fit on a big face."
18005,0,Tight fit,I don't consider myself to have a very large head but I found this item to be quite tight. I know you don't want a loose fit but this is almost uncomfortable but luckily my commute is only about 20 mins. It is also not too terribly warm. The ear protection that I was hoping to get just simply isn't that great. I am going to be searching for a better alternative.
18008,0,doesnt fit my face very well,"for the price i cant complain too much, but it doesnt fit my face very well. im not a big guy, 5' 8"", 160lb, and its a pretty tight fit.the open portion goes pretty wide, but again, you cant expect a perfect fitting high quality anything for $5"
18012,0,Was this product repackaged?,"I'm not 100% sure that I'm reviewing the same product shown here. The one I have is labeled Noxzema Citrus Scrub with Vitamin C. The packaging is very similar but has a clear section where you can see the product. It has the same ""tingly citrus formula"" tag line. So take this with a grain of salt...The actual product is disappointing. I wouldn't really call it a ""scrub"", although you can feel a few particles of grit in there. It's more of a soap. It does have a very pleasant scent, though.If you're just looking for a gentle face soap, you might like this a lot. But if your primary goal is to exfoliate, I would look elsewhere."
18014,0,I have founded many errors in this book,I have founded many errors in chapter 8 of this book and I want to contact with its author
18020,0,Great at this price,"A very high quality novelty mouse. It still works like a mouse. It must stay on a surface. The one annoyance is the trigger has about 3/4 inch of play in it. With a ""Trigger job"" (duct tape over the slot) it was perfect. It gave my wrist a much needed rest. Worth the $3 I paid for it as a daily deal."
18026,0,Good and bad,"This is a very attractive and very well crafted bird feeder. The problem I had with it was that the only place I could hang it was over my deck. The birds definitely flocked to it. But, they threw more seeds onto my deck and into my planter boxes, than they ate. If you could hang it from a tree limb, it would probably be ideal, because (I suspect) the birds would go after all the spilled seeds that hit the ground. Then, again, if the ground was covered with snow, the spilled seeds would be lost. So, I really wouldn't recommend it."
18033,0,Not UV rated as noted in the description,In the manufacturer description it states this is UV rated. We just got this and nowhere on the box or in the manual does it say anything at all about any UV rating of any kind.
18040,0,"Great concept, but no interest","My 1 year old son loves music, so I got him this piano. He never played with it, so I gave it to his 1 and a half year old cousin, who at least likes to carry it from room to room."
18048,0,Bad audio,I am a fan of Mortal Kombat. But when I was watching the movie the audio just sucked!It was a bad audio transfer job.
18049,0,"Campy, fun, overboard",I am a huge fan of B movies and flicks that look like they could have been played on Black Belt Theater. The campy special effects of MK reminded me of the many hours I spent watching BB theater and practicing moves even after I had been studying various martial arts. This movie reminds me of the old chestnut: do you train actors in the martial arts or do you train martial artists to act. I was impressed with Robin Shou and the actor that played Johnny cage (Linden Ashby). The blonde actress left me wishing the role would have gone to Cynthia Rothrock.
18056,0,Size runs very small,Couldn't get my foot more than half way in. Liked the style very much but was not confident I would get the right size by reordering. Cost me ove 8 dollars to return the shoes.Easy Spirit Women's Motion Sport Lace Up/ camel
18059,0,its ok,This book is good if you already have finance background. Solved examples are fewer than needed and all unsolved problems don't have answers. This book is not perfect i am facing hard time to get through.
18061,0,I had to edit this review... DOH!,"I still believe this razor for the most part is a gimick. Tonight when shaving I changed the cartridge that came on the handle to the spare on the back of the case and I got much better results. I took a closer look at the original cartridge and it didn't look right. Looks dull to me, no wonder I was getting cut up bad. I have contacted Gillette and I'm waiting for a response. I hope this isn't some kind of manufacturing flaw, but if it is this razor should be recalled or we should be compensated.Anybody else have this problem?"
18066,0,effective,I didn't notice an exceptional difference between this cleaner and others I have tried. I wouldn't pay more for this. I use it with my ultrasonic cleaner machine and it is effective.
18067,0,Long distance driver with kids,Unit has the juice to power the wife's laptop and the kids' DVD player though I got nothing out of the USB plug even when everything else was unplugged.
18069,0,Works as expected,"Got this for a road trip from San Diego to LA to charge up my cellphone. It worked great at the beginning.After one hour into driving, my cellphone started making noise indicating the power was connected/disconnected. Unplugging and replugging the charger made the symptom went away for just a brief moment. It seems like the power went on and off repeatedly. I am not sure if this was caused by the inverter or the cellphone charger, but I've never had any problem when the charger was connected to the wall directly.As noted in other reviews, the power indicator is not bright enough to tell if the unit is on. This is especially true when driving under the hot sun. And it gets really hot when operating."
18071,0,No Airplane Adapter,"Be aware that Xantrex has changed the design of the product and is a lot smaller and is not as picture. It also DOES NOT have the airline adapter as stated in the description. It now only includes a cigarette plug and a car battery clamp. So if you need this product for in airplane use, the redsigned product will not meet your needs. I was able to scavenge an airline adapter from a Xantrex inverter I had."
18084,0,OK toy,I bought this toy for my son and he loved it at first but after a couple of days he wasn't really interested in it anymore. The wheels spin easily which makes him have to work harder to keep it from running away from him. The basket where he can put balls in is his favorite part. He uses it like a little shopping cart. I found a fisher price walker at a garage sale and he uses it as a walker daily. I've switched the stride to ride to the riding function and he sits on it but doesn't know how to make it go yet. All in all it's an okay toy but I wouldn't purchase it again. I'd get the fisher price one instead because the wheels have resistance so it doesn't run away from him and he can turn it easier.
18088,0,Not the best walker for learning,We bought this walker for our son when he was starting to walk. At 11 months it is still way too fast for him. He loves the music but it simply rolls too fast for him to walk behind without either my husband or myself holding onto it. I hope that he will be able to use it as a ride-on toy a little later but I'm disapointed in it as a walker. Perhaps if they added some sort of tension to the wheels?
18092,0,Silent night deadly night,Being a horror movie buff this was kinda cheesy and not really that scary Im glad I didnt pay to much to rent it.
18096,0,I would like more info,this was a slow read and not what I thought it would be. I would like to read a little more of the diappearances.
18102,0,You get what you pay for,This is a bit unsturdy. Akward to pick up balls with. It does the job though. And for the price it's fine. It does NOT hold 75 balls. I counted 50 at the most and then they start to pop out and you have to pick them up again.
18109,0,a Mixed Bag,"I have to give Mandy Moore credit for covering such an eclectic bunch of songs. She is absolutely a great singer ( although I think she's a better actress - she was great in ""Saved"" ). I don't listen to teen pop, so I've no idea how to compare this to any of her albums of original material. I have no problem with the fact that these songs are all covers versions, but I have to say the arrangements, vocal and instrumental, are too safe. They stick too close to the original versions, so it's hard to say they'd got the ""Mandy Moore"" stamp on them. It's all a bit sterile, a bit karaoke, for me to fully enjoy."
18110,0,A lesson in not mending what aint broken,"It is a pity that what was one of the finest acoustic guitar albums of the 80's has, in this manifestation, lost the pulse in arguably the two strongest tracks, Santa Monica and Nice Feeling. The original vinyl recording was truly worth 5 stars, It had a swing and continuity to the piece but I gave it an average 3 stars because of this re-presentation. Having said that though, If you are new to this CD then you should view it as a 5 as you will not know what you have missed out on. It is still a cracking work and affords an elevated status in the corpus of acoustic guitar music and space in your collection."
18116,0,Thump!,"I didn't buy this or register for it but was given this item from my younger sister who was giving away her baby items. It seemed like an ideal thing to have in the crib to keep the baby entertained. The music is a little annoying but the baby loved it, which was more important. It was soothing to him and he loved the bubbles and the fish going up and down. The only problem I have with this item is that my baby would bang his head against it while he was rolling over in the crib. I would hear a ""thump"" during his nap time. My sister had the same problem. It's great while the baby is awake to enjoy it, but remove it once the baby falls asleep. Especially if the baby can roll over on his/her own (6 mos or so). Perhaps Fisher-Price should look into adding some padding around it? Otherwise, a nice product."
18119,0,what happened to the original aquarium?????,THE ONE THAT CAME OUT BEFORE THIS ONE WAS MUCH BETTER. IT HAD A WINDOW AT THE TOP SO THE WAVES OF THE WATER AND LIGHT REFLECTED ON THE CEILING. THAT WAS GREAT. THIS MODEL IS NOT THAT GREAT. MY SON LIKED IT BUT NOW THE BUBBLES DO NOT WORK. I HAVE ONLY HAD IT FOR 3 MONTHS SO NOW I AM GOING TO HAVE TO CALL FISHER PRICE TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO ABOUT THIS. I DID NOT PAY $29.99 FOR IT TO ONLY WORK FOR 3 MONTHS! I AM DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THIS AND VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS ONE DOES NOT DO WHAT THE ORIGINAL DID. WHAT A WASTE! IF THERE WAS A ZERO FOR DURABLITY I WOULD GIVE IT THAT!
18129,0,Not very entertaining,"I thought the Ocean Wonders Aqaurium would be entertaining for my 6 month old daughter. She loves to look at the live fish tanks that her daycare provider has so I thought this would be a great buy. It did not interest her and she just ended up kicking off the crib onto the floor. Also, the toy consumes much battery power and needs new batteries at least once a month.My daughter found it to be ""not very entertainig"" at all."
18130,0,Not necessary but grows into it...,"My son has just started noticing this toy at six months, even though he has had it since day 1. He is now able to roll into it and turn it on. I often turn it on as he falls asleep for noise/distraction, and I like that it shuts itself off after about 5 minutes."
18132,0,better for tiny babies?,"bought this at around 4 month for my son after receiving numerous glowing reports. I figured anything that might help his colic and fighting-sleep spasms couldn't hurt to try. it's cute, he likes to look at it, and it soothes ME, but doesn't do a thing to calm him. he rolls around his crib all night long so i can't keep it in there b/c he accidently knocks it on and wakes up (NOT what you want with a fussy baby!). Also, the on/off switch is so big that when he gets excited and wants to play with it, he ends up turning it off and on off and on, gets frustrated by that and loses interest. So, maybe newborns who can't really play with it but can look and listen would love it."
18142,0,its ok for play not for calming,i bought this toy to keep my little girl from fussyness while awake in her crib she is 4 months old and it hangs to high in the crib so she cant see the lights or moving fish but it keeps her perfectly happy if you are holding her up so she can see but all babys are diffrent so all i can say is good luck everything is trial and error hope i was somewhat helpful
18158,0,Covers all bases but is very very repetitive!,"Though very helpful and it does seem to cover all area and questions/concerns a mother may have, it's also extremely repetitive! In every chapter I felt like I was re-reading something from the last chapter almost word for word. The same topics are addressed over and over. The book could be cut in half and still cover all bases."
18161,0,5 stars for show/1 star for universal dvd's,"Love Mcmillan & wife, but having the same problems as other reviewers. Two skips on disc 1 side A which create big gaps in the storyline, but luckily it didn't stop playing completely once I hit the play button again. But it keeps freezing at the same spot every time, and I'm using a brand new dvd player. This show is so fun to watch, and it is extremely annoying that Universal appears to have produced defective dvd's en masse."
18162,0,Another home-base business book from the Edwards,"Working at home seems like a dream for many. The Edwards have written several books on working on home. Their advice is sound and filled with common sense. However, this book does not rate a 5 because it is lacking in details about individual businesses you can start at home. They do have other home businesses books, as I stated. These are filled with 3-5 pages at the most on some individual businesses, but does not go too far into details about each, obviously. But for an overview of starting a home-based business at all, this is a decent book."
18165,0,SKIN DEEP,the book has a good story line and i liked the way it was presented to the reader. there were times when i felt that it was a little drawn out. i found myself skipping a couple of pages.
18166,0,Insightful,"Skin Deep gives an oppulent view of dealing with the prejudices and perils that often accompany being of mixed heritage. Kathleen also delves into how one knows who they are. Do you define your race and character according to your color, creed, and parents, or do you define yourself by who you've loved and those that love you back? The story made me think about such things. Insight is all that I received though. I never developed a relationship with the characters of Skin Deep. I really didn't care what happened to them or how their problems were solved. This bothered me because I thought the idea for the story was awesome, but I needed more of a connection or deep caring for the characters. It took me a while to finish the story. I didn't race home from work to read it. Nevertheless, Skin Deep's theme was unique and the point of view held me through out the novel."
18167,0,a thinking person's romance novel...,"in general, Skin Deep is a breezy, entertaining, and at times a quite moving read, exploring important issues like the connection between self loathing and interracial dating, single parenthood, and the confusion caused by the conflict between one's socialized racial identity and their biological racial make-up. good stuff that was handled persuasively and even-handedly by a very competent first-time writer. however, i've read in some of the other 'online reviews' that other readers found the ending to be 'surprising' and 'strong', but i couldn't disagree more. i personally found the ending to be a bit pat, manipulative, and (ironically) soap opera-ish. certainly this story and the important issues so deftly and subtly handled in the rest of the novel deserved a better, less sensationalized, more organic conclusion. still, a solid first novel. support this sista and buy it. tell your friends to buy it. spread the good word... peace."
18172,0,A Bit Misleading,"When I bought this little plane (and I do mean little) the description said that it would turn left, right, go forward and backward. Actually it only goes forward and backward, and when in reverse it automatically turns in one direction. Now I see that the description has been changed, which is good, but I feel I was misled.Also, don't be led into believing that this plane is more than five inches long. If five inches qualifies as ""medium"" in your book, you'll love this plane. :-)"
18177,0,"Obscure, not kid friendly","I was hoping to be able to share these fables with my boys. While reading I found that I had to edit on the fly. Some are not kid friendly. So when you're reading about Mr. Duck and you see that he gets eaten by the lion, you could understand my dilemma. Perhaps this is a good exercise for improvisational reading.Some of the tales are downright puzzling as well. If the moral of the story is saying ""Huh?!?"" then many tales accomplish that objective.I would prefer a book that's edited for 21st Century taste and with appropriate fables for kids. I'm sure the book is faithful to the original literature but that's not what I was looking for here."
18180,0,No accounting for taste.,"The only reason this shake is getting two stars instead of one is because I have lost 7 lbs. in the past four weeks by using the herbalife products. This flavor of shake tastes like chalk and leaves the dark ""cookie"" pieces in the bottom of your cup. It tastes bad and doesn't mix well. The chocolate, vanilla and cafe latte flavored mixes are a vast improvement in the taste department."
18183,0,Good for 1st and 2nd; not good for 5th grader,"I ordered this for my 5th grader who is struggling with spelling while writing compositions. After we reviewed it, the words do not contain different forms of the words (often the base word only). For a more advanced writer who needs to understand the endings this is not good. However, for a 1st spelling book I think it is ok. I am going to give it to my 2nd grader."
18184,0,A good movie overly criticized.,I just watched this movie and it was okay. It was not as bad as 'others' think it was. It sounds like they just wanted to see Alicia Silverstone naked. Get a life people!Alicia Silverstone gives a good performance. Sienna Guillory also gives a good effort. This movie has a dark overtone and a sort of flat ending. Watch the whole movie before you start to trash it. IF it is naked poeple you want please rent porno.
18186,0,Only for collectors,"I purchased this video thinking it was the American version with Meredith Baxter Birney. Instead, it appears to be a BBC version maybe made for TV. If you can get passed the girls' phony wigs, its really not too bad. However, the girls verge on shrieking at times and some of the acting comes across less than professional. Still, if you enjoy various versions, this is another for the collection."
18187,0,Not sure I would buy it again!,"I listened to all of the CD's and read the Encyclopedia Dr. Rosenthal has written. Then today 11/10/10, I took my NCE's. I passed.....yes!! However, it was through no help of the book and very little help from the CD's. I do not think the CD's were helpful to me, maybe just to bring certain names and terminology to mind. The questions on the test seemed to have very little to do with the information I gleaned from the CD's. In many ways it gave me false hope that I was actually going to learn info that I could use to improve my chances of passing the test. I would have been better off going from my own notes and the CACREP areas of study. I could have used the money I spent to a much better use than the CD's."
18190,0,Too pricey for the material,"Product is not bad. It has reinforced ribbing along the seams, which of course strengthens it a bit. But for $5+ it's too pricey. I had expected a thicker plastic and it is thoroughly see-thru. But for travel, especially for airport security, it's perfect and functional. I can't say I would buy this again. I'm sure I could find one elsewhere for lesser price."
18205,0,Mixed,"Some of the tracks on this album are really inovative and strong - however, there are a number of weak, popcorn-sounding pieces that just don't work for me."
18206,0,Skippable,"I bought the vinyl. I also own Ki-Oku, Zen and Krush, all of which I would not part with, and this one stood out as just an average house music album. I think DJK's strongest efforts are realized more on Krush and Zen where there's more substance, more hip-hop, which I'd like to think of as contrasting elements put together in a workable relationship. I love Ki-Oku, but I think it doesn't really challenge the formal elements of sound as deeply as the artist is able to, there's not enough work with contrasting sound elements to hold it together as triumphantly as on Zen or Krush. Message at the Depth fails to offer anything new or interesting--though perhaps it has some value to other DJs, I wouldn't play it at a party. ""Well, time to go shave my neck. This has been Zebraneck, coming to you straight from the north pole."""
18208,0,Good cable for the money,"Needed an USB extension cable and this one worked well. As a matter o fact, it's still in use on one of my son's computers today."
18223,0,Abyss soars in picture but falls in sound,"The special edition of this movie does help explain some plot holes that seemed missing in original version. The digital transfer of the movie gives it a better and more real-life like feel of the underwater world. The aliens are more powerful than it was shown in original version. The submarine was brought down on purpose not accidentally probed. This movie though tediously slow-paced would have gotten a five star if not for the sound. The sound is subdued and even the score which sounded great 10 years ago feels underperformed in this movie. NOW, I know why the Abyss may be in Dolby Digital sound but it is NOT 5.1 discrete. It is in at best 5.0 which is a combination of Digital surround and pro-logic front. MY PROGIC LOGIC DISPLAY BUTTON is on at all times throughout the movie. Think about it how else could he put two versions of a 2+ hour movie on the same disc. Lastly, that is some cool tidal wave at the end."
18226,0,Movie was great if I could have watched it without interruption!,"I love this movie; it is a great movie from my childhood that I recall fondly. However, the amazon player was spotty, even when it said the connection was good. It kept stopping and skipping terribly in one area of the movie, which was VERY annoying. I have never had this happen so badly before while using the amazon player. Disappointed."
18232,0,More of much the same,"Loved Marcia Balls other worksbut this unexciting, but with a bitmore pizzaz than Roadside Attractions.She keeps falling into the trap ofpotboiling sounds and rhythms - thoughsome differences on this album"
18245,0,"Not short of action, thats for sure","Once again, we find our hard-core hero thrown into another entirely unbeleivable situation crammed with enough gunfights, explosions, wickedly evil terrorists, and foul language to last a lifetime in 2 hours. It is fun to watch as pretty much anyone will be entertained by it, but the plot is more of a repeat of the last one than anything else. This is probobly the worst of the three movies, but for most guys it is still worth a watch. An action-packed adrenaline rush that will leave you begging for more. (Plot that is) Keep it as far away from your kids as humanly possible, or you will spend your life savings in a week on soap washing their mouths out."

18261,0,Buyer Beware Review of Reviews for MVT,"Many of the following reviews appear to be a case of overzelaous MVT proponents who got togther on Aug 20-21 '06 and in April 15-16 '06 to write smashing 5 star reviews of the MVT consulting promo book.However it appears the book does have some value, but being better than six sigma is not saying much. Several case studies in the book are no doubt true, but you have to be a special MVT consultant to use the avanced statstical methods. However, they may not be needed for one to get valuable ideas from the book. One balanced reviewer suggest the remedy may be in getting the book: ""Design of Experiments for Scientists and Engineers"", to run the complex statstical models.I still plan to buy the book, used, just not today."
18263,0,Your Average Controller,"The controller fits in your hand but the two joysticks collide and make it hard to go left or right. The cords get tangled up alot. The buttons are way to confusing. On the other hand the controller does provide long-term comfort after using it, it doesn't brake easily like Gamecube controllers. The cords doesn't have two confusing sections like Xbox. Overall it's a 3/5 controller!"
18265,0,Neuvo Drama,This movie stands out for a number of reasons. The method of intermixing black and white and color to show when in time we were was done nicely along with some beautiful camera work. The acting and story is excellent which leads one to wonder why the film didn't receive more recognition. Be sure to at least rent this movie. I think you will see that it is worth adding to anyones DVD collection.
18268,0,good but galaxies away from greatness,"There is little doubt that the beatles wrote a lot of infectious pop tunes but to deify them as THE BEST band of all time as so many do is laughable.The Beatles came along at the right time and place and struck a chord with a mass audience.That does not make them great,however.Their music is thoroughly lightweight-musical popcorn,if you please.Led Zeppelin had soul and emotion and great musicianship.The Stones had it all for the first ten or twelve years.Blach Sabbath had a depth and guitar playing second to none.Metallica with Cliff Burton was untouchable.To hear ""Call of Ktulu"" or ""Orion"" is to know The Beatles just aren't in the same league with the true greats.A hundred years from now The Beatles will be little more than a footnote in the annals of music.This album is pretty good.If quaint and occasionally charming featherweight tunes are your thing then this album is as good as any.Have a nice day!"
18270,0,Taking the good with the bad,"Worthwhile for John Lennon's contributions, of course, as well as ""Penny Lane"", one of Paul McCartney's best songs from that period. The rest of McCartney's songs are lightweight pop. Harrison's contribution, ""Blue Jay Way"", is an unmitigated bore; George repeatedly sings ""Please don't be long"", but unfortunately doesn't take his own advice. Finally, the instrumental ""Flying"" is an utter throwaway."
18271,0,Just not a big favorite ...,"Of all the Beatles' albums I own, this one is least frequently in the CD changer. I do like the title cut, and ""I Am The Walrus,"" but the rest of the tracks don't do much for me. This album feels almost as disjointed as the movie for which it serves as soundtrack. I think it's an important piece to have in terms of fleshing out a collection, but not one that is particularly dear to me."
18280,0,"Good, but not great","I've loved The Beatles since I was 8 years-old, but have to admit that I think this is the weakest of their later albums. There are a few great moments (I Am the Walrus, Strawberry Fields) but there are a lot of mediocre songs too. Many of the songs strike me as superficial -- A Fool on the Hill has a nice melody but is too pedestrian; the title track isn't even a complete song, etc. And I think the album's production is too schmaltzy, a classic example of late '60s excess."
18282,0,3 1/2 stars for this Country Lifting,"I like this album. It's a little lengthy, but Bright Eyes is one of those artists that doesn't waste the minutes he uses.I don't like it as well as everybody else who has reviewed it though. I read, somewhere, of this album that it doesn't quite have the angst of his previous albums. I think that's pretty accurate, and maybe that's because he's outgrown his angst years, I don't know. What I do know is that for me, this album lacked that sense of urgency that have been on his other albums, that sense of ""this might kill me if I don't get it out and sing about it."" That's not on this album.However, Casadaga is full of good songs. I am quite fond of ""Soul Singer in a Session Band.""I don't know if he'll ever top ""I'm Wide Awake it's Morning."""
18288,0,Tora! Tora! Tora! - Blu-ray,"A troubled production and a flop at the box office, Tora! Tora! Tora! certainly can't count lack of ambition as one of its faults. A history lesson come to life, the film dramatized the attack on Pearl Harbor from both the American and Japanese perspectives; while I like its commitment to historical accuracy, I feel the film lacked dramatic heft. The American scenes were directed by Hollywood pro Richard Fleischer, but it was the Japanese scenes that caused headaches for the producers; originally, Akira Kurosawa was to direct, but he backed out, only to be replaced by action director Toshio Masuda and future Battle Royale helmer Kinji Fukasaku. With a cast that includes Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten, and Jason Robards, as well as Kurosawa and Ozu players So Yamamura and Eijiro Tono, the new Tora! Tora! Tora! Blu-ray is a great stocking stuffer for military buffs on your holiday shopping list."
18292,0,BLU-Ray review? Where? and...why criticise the Japanes for FDR's plan?,"I'm really sorry for Bowen's characterization of the Pearl Harbor attack as an unwarranted ""sneak attack"". In the first place, FDR manuvered (forced?) Japan into action and in the second place, I think we stopped ""warning"" the enemy of attacks in 1500 when the English kings would parlay with their opposition to decide when the ""mutual"" attack was to take place. I think we were actually very fortunate that the attack was a ""surprise"" and our ships hadn't put to sea. they would have still been sunk...but this time in 1200' of water instaed of 42'. Modern warfare is not enhanced by ""early warnings"". They would just be stupid.And, I just ordered this Blu-Ray version since it has to be better than the original. I got ""Jaws"" in Blu-Ray and it's like looking through a window. If ""Tora Tora, Tora"" is half as good, it must be exceptional!"
18293,0,Semi unusual problem,"Have a playback issue with this disk. The Japaneese dialogue is done in Japaneese with english sub titles. And subtitles are displayed underneath, not part of, the picture. I'm fine with all that. But in watching those scenes I could not get my player to show more than the first line of the subtitled dialogue thereby missing anything beyond that first line. Finally gave up because couldn't tell what was going on. Otherwise great looking disk."
18294,0,Tora! Tora! Tora!,"Great movie. Its a shame Hollywood feels the need to change history, which they do quite often, by making the statement by the Japanese Admiral Yamamoto about the time they were too bomb Pearl Harbor. The Japanese had nothing to do with the Geneva Convention during 1941, so to say they were to bomb at 0830 to abide by it was incorrect. It wasnt till 1942 that the Japanese Empire signed the accord. Shame on Hollywood trying to lighten what the Japanese did to our country."
18303,0,just ordinar,"It`s just like any other vaccum, no big difference from the one that I have before, regular one."
18308,0,What's up with the broken belts?!?,"Got this vacuum in June 2009. Also ordered a replacement belt package (2 belts) at the same time. The vacuum has worked pretty well for us but we have been having nothing but problems with the belts.By September the original belt and the 2 replacement belts had broken and I had to order another package of 2 belts at that time. Since then 1 more belt has broken.Don't know if it is the vacuum design or just cheap belts. Of the 4 belts that have broken (so far!), 1 was the wife's fault. She ran over a scarf which got caught up in the rotating brush until it just stretched the belt out too much that it broke. I have absolutely no idea why the other 3 belts broke."
18310,0,"good, not great","Read a lot of reviews and this one got the highest number of positive reviews. This review is written after one , initial use. It is very maneuverable, does a great job sucking up the dirt and is not overly noisy. However, it does not have a shutdown feature for if something big, like the carpet, gets sucked up. Therefore, we have ruined one throw rug- it ate it pretty thoroughly (granted, I had assigned the job to a teenager, but still...). I like the bagless feature and the hand power tool. Another disappointment was the length of the cord for the crevice tool- the reach is very limited- ceiling height, but you have to keep dragging the machine around with you as it has minimal stretch to it. It is also larger than I expected- so it takes up quite a bit of storage space. Overall it is good, but not great."
18314,0,"works fine, but...","when I am vacuuming, if I hit the wall's base molding (white) with the front edge of the vac, it leaves a black mark on it. To work around that, I tapped up the front edge, but I think Hoover should use a different non-marking material for the front edge.Other than that, it really ""sucks"" and I love it!"
18330,0,A biography that lost its way,"This began as an excellent biography of a woman who has an important story to tell. But Lula got lost after Stevie started recording. Granted, the table of contents says Part II is about Stevie. But the covers says, ""An Authorized Biography of Lula Hardaway."" I wanted to know where Lula was during Stevie's teenaged years. We suddenly find she's in a second marriage and has more kids. Then we learn she's divorced (for a second time--we never learned about the first divorce, either) and living in Los Angeles. The ending brought her back briefly, and reminded us of her message. I would have liked the whole book to be about her, as the cover promised. She deserved it."
18332,0,Bas Rutten,I mean Enough said Even though Bas was in it for like a minute it was worth it movie overal was ok but a must have for any bas rutten fan.
18335,0,Just good enough for the exam,"This book written in the Headfirst style is good enough to get you through the SCBCD exam sucessfully. Unfortunately the book contradicts it's self in quite a few places and barely ever goes into the details of why things are organized the way they are. It has many errors too, so be sure to check the errata on the oreilly website. It is by no means enough for an EJB developer and it has even not enough information on the EJB spec."
18336,0,Too big .,This is a book for somebody who wants to learn abc of ejb.I think it is too big for a certification guide 700 pages.People with some previous experience will get very frustrated.very very slow.no patterns.very little code.better read the spec.Mastering ejb 2nd edition is much better.
18348,0,"Interesting, but not compelling reading...","The book contains numerous interesting anecdotes. If you are interested in Social History and Psychology, there is plenty to mull over. However, it is too long-winded and laborious to read."
18349,0,Flash Gordon: Space Soldiers Conquor the Universe,"The three-star rating is not for the writing or production values, but for the nostalgic fun the adventure brings. This is only for fans of the series. A torchlight search amid glaciers is done well enough to belong in a better movie, but such things as sputtering spaceships and the unintentionally funny ""mechanical men"" are what we really watch the twelve episodes for. Charles Middleton as Ming the Merciless is a memorable villain without any discernable acting, and Buster Crabbe as always makes a credible, intelligent action hero."
18356,0,VC++ Debugger,"This book stays to much on the surface. - In the main part it describes how to use the VC++ Debugger (the menu, the buttons). It's ok for beginners."
18358,0,Amazing singer but no new songs,"There is no doubt in my mind that Nana is is the most outstanding singer on earth and that her ability to sing in many languages is quite unique and unrivalled. The songs on this CD are all magnificent. The only problem is that they are all recycled from previous recordings, all of which had been recently released when Recuerdos 2 came out. This is just another compilation CD the record company came out with to make extra money. If you already have all the original CDs then this CD is a total waste of money. Buy all the original albums instead and listen to all of the songs on each one. You'll be glad you did."
18365,0,NOT ENOUGH PLOT,"Although this is obviously a musical, there was a bit TOO MUCH singing and not enough emphasis on the plot. Jennifer Hudson was fantastic, and definitely deserved her Oscar, but the movie falls flat in a lot of places. Still, I'm glad I watched it, if only to see Jennifer Hudson's amazing performance!"
18366,0,"I wanted to really love it, but...","Was really excited for Dreamgirls to come out. I haven't seen the play, but I am happy that Hollywood is doing more film musicals. I don't want to give too much away, but the story really becomes flowery at the end. At the start it brings in heavy subjects like: drugs, pregnancy, weight problems, who is the center of the spotlight, love tiffs, and more. I KNOW it's a musical, but this is obviously a biography of the Supremes. And I am pretty sure the outcome that happened in the movie, didn't happen in real life. It has a great begining and build, but the conclusion is just not what I thought it was going to be.I'm not going to say don't see it because the music is great, Jennifer Hudson deserved all her awards. During the finish of her big number the theatre greatly applauded for her. That never happens at movies! See it for that. But the script adaptation did not really sell it for me."
18376,0,I like the book. I think it's helping me study.,The book so far seems to be doing a good job pointing out the areas where I need to study more. I have not taken my Frontpage98 exam yet. I'm concerned that the other reviews indicate that the actual test was much harder than the cram exam. I would have liked to know whether or not these people passed their exam. I will write back in with a comment to indicate what I thought about the book in realtionship to the cram exam book.
18381,0,Not much of a veggie eater.,"I like to mix it with half apple juice/ half water as recommended. I have no way to tell of its effectiveness. However, I like the taste of the product. I like the principle of the product. I am sloppy about regularly eating enough fruits and veggies. So I will wait and see but feel better about using this product than not."
18388,0,Ian's Review,Rampage:World Tour is pretty boring. when i first got the game it was fun but then I got tired of it. it got boring because you do the same thing on each level which is destroy all the buildings and eat people for bonus points. If you are thinking of buying this game then rent it before you buy it.
18393,0,it is an old classic,"It is hard but the tricks you can do are fun, I had this game for the Nintendo Nes system the music was cute. this would not be only skateboard game you should buy. this was a game I played a while back and has stuck with me."
18395,0,More a l950s screenplay than a novel,"Sea of Grass has larger than life characters, one dimensional, more suitable to the big screen than a novel. The love story is melodramatic and doesn't really involve the reader. It may have played better in the nineteen forties than it does at the end of the 20th century. They function more as a backdrop to the drama being played out on the land than as a story unto itself. The real story is a battle of the homesteaders against the great cattle herders with Mother Nature winning in the end. A moderate recommendation."
18400,0,Flawed but still worthwhile,"I don't think this would convert someone to liking Alan Stivell's music, but for those who already like his more accessible work it is worth a listen, if you can get hold of a copy -- although don't expect a collection of celtic folk tunes! It was one of the first CDs I bought (which may show how old it and I are!) and I still listen to it with enjoyment. In summary, I think it works well in some parts and doesn't work in others, but unlike another reviewer I don't go so far as to skip over the bits I don't like. Yes, some of the singing is indecipherable; yes, some of the repetition goes on for too long; some of the musical passages don't seem to lead anywhere, but amongst all of that there are some brilliantly written and very powerful passages."
18403,0,"A solid album, but not something that is always enjoyable","Okay, I am a huge Cornell fan, and this album reflects on his incredible music genious. I bought it after hearing ""Can't Change Me"" a couple of times on the radio. That is probably the most rock-like song on this recording. His voice is absolutely tremendous. Still, there are some skipable tracks here. About three fourths of the songs are good. But they are not incredible. I still want Cornell to make me headbang, and none of these songs make me do it. If you can't appreciate any kind of crooning, don't buy it. But if you can enjoy smooth and flowing vocals this is for you."
18413,0,Why not the colorised version?,"I bought the colorised video of The Longest Day and the color improved it.I know that there are people that are against this but the fact is,as far as action movies are concerned,color improves them."

18430,0,"Good read, ends abruptly","This is a worthwhile read, with an unusual protagonist (for crime fiction) Inspector Imanishi is likeable, well-adjusted, and conscientious. He has friends, gets along with his wife and sister, and isn't an alcoholic or an addict. Nor does he fight with his boss. Despite these defects, I thoroughly enjoyed following his efforts to solve an unusual case."
18431,0,Inspector Imanashi entertains,"I just read Inspector Imanishi Investigates and quite enjoyed it. It's a procedural whodunnit set in Japan in the fifties. I'm intrigued by the style and dialogue, but I'm most struck by how much I want to go to Japan and see the locations described.There were a number of twists and dead ends throughout the book, but I especially liked the final twist."
18436,0,Size doesn't matter,"Few, but EFFECTIVE, hints that stress on the importance of being clear and consise when defining objectives, praising or critisizing employees. Recommended."
18451,0,"Not as bad as I heard it was, in fact it's pretty good!","I just saw this movie for the first time. I confess i only wanted to see it because I heard it was terrible and thought it would be kinda fun for that reason. I was pleasantly suprised to find it is a pretty good suspense/drama. Melanie griffith is not bad, despite her babydoll voice. Michael Douglas is kinda stiff though. The film is beautifully directed and photographed. Not so bad after all."
18454,0,Good for beginners ONLY!,"The video has two separate 25 minutes work-outs, with aerobic and exercises for hips,buns and abs.I bought this video when I was 16 and had never exercised before. The first times I couldn't complete the full 25 minutes, but after doing it every day for a couple of weeks I could see my tighs getting firmer. After a year, I started joging etc and stopped using the tape.Now I'm 20. At the end of this summer i picked up the tape agin and began exercising with it. It's really not a challenge if you're not a beginner anymore. Now, I do both of the separate 25 minutes work-outs together, but still don't feel I've got a good workout. The exercises for legs and bun are quite good, but Jane pays too little time on the abs. The instructors are very sweet and keep you motivated, but I would only recommend it for beginners."
18465,0,OK price for low level quality,Had to clean the guides because full of particles from machining. Warped. Still ok for the price. Used WD40 to protect from corrosion.

18484,0,Not what I expected.,"In rural America of the early nineteenth Century, by the Hudson River, lies the small village of Sleepy Hollow. The only recently arrived scholl teacher, the tall and lean Ichabod Crane, likes to spend his evenings by the fire with the old Dutch wives, listening to local horror stories of ghouls and goblins and haunted houses, among which that of the headless horseman, until one night after leaving the ball, he is chased by the legendary Galloping Hessian.I read this story because I love the film, and was surprised to see how few pages, less than ten out of fifty, were actually devoted to the mystery of the headless horseman itself. Although very well written, with descriptions that are stunningly real, the book left me hungry for more."
18492,0,I think its time to start thinking on ending the series.,"I dont know didn't like this season all that much. They seem to be a lot of filler episodes where the comedy is OK i guess.

But...couple of thoughts: Dan is in command of a rather old Spruance class ship: could it be that these are the ones Poyer knows in detail, and since he left the Navy he has no way to keep up with the newer classes? He won't be able to keep the Spruance thing going for long,they're starting to be scrapped! [EDIT 4/21/2008- Thanks to an alert commenter who points out that Poyer does in fact know the newer Perry class.]It's a good story, except right at the end, I felt he underplayed the effect of the nuclear blast - could the ship really have survived at all? And what about the heavy doses of radiation, his and others? And what was going to happen to the fallout plume? that stuff drifts....I think he set Dan up for a desk job - or maybe no more jobs! Dan's marriage is going away if he stays at sea, that's for sure."
18508,0,"Lasted one year, but company replaced it",We bought this can crusher December 2010 it broke by September 2012. It worked ok for that period but plastic is a horrible material for this use. It cracked which rendered the entire unit worthless. This was a complete waste of $30.I have contacted Easy Pull about the warranty and will update if and when a replacement arrives.Update: The replacement arrived yesterday and works great. I am increasing my rating to 3 stars due to the great customer service. I hope this one lasts longer than a year.
18510,0,Good 12oz crusher,Does a good job crushing 12oz cans but anything larger does not fit. Stable and durable but any Monster cans or Full throtle or anything larger than a 12oz can I still need to stomp.
18512,0,not for ALL cans,"Was disappointed, but that was my own faultDidn't ask the question - does it crush big beer cans?It only crushes small soft drink cans.We don't drink soft drinks in cans,so haven't used it once yet!"
18515,0,Could Be Better,"I needed this book for a college level class and I feel that as textbooks go there are definitely better and clearer ones out there. I felt like I had to struggle to understand a lot of the poetry and the stories. I had to keep a French/English dictionary fairly close by at all times. It could have been the class and the professor (both of which I didn't care much for either) but I really struggled in this French class to make sense of the lessons.Also, it's a fairly expensive book and you don't get too much out of it. The CD is great to listen along with to help with your speaking, but really it's just reading some of the poems in the book. If you're buying this on your own I'd suggest you keep looking for something that will help you individually. If you, like me, are using it for class buy it used or rent it. This isn't anything that I'm ever going to pick up again and thumb through. In fact, I believe I sold it back to the store."
18518,0,"Predictable plot, but interesting heroine","Old-as-time plot line (young woman growing up and going against convention) is livened somewhat by Forster's interesting heroine, Lucy. I found the ending a bit dissatisfying, perhaps because we don't get to see the reactions of Lucy's loved ones to her final choice. Although I haven't seen the movie, it is extremely easy to visualize a Merchant-Ivory type production from reading the book."
18521,0,An old love story about one's place in society,"This book is over 100 years old and as a result, it is not the most flowing book. It deals much with society and one's place in society, of a woman torn between two men, one from her class and another from a different class. It was a bit difficult to separate what part of the book was intentionally placing characters in their societal place and what part of the society issues were a result of the time the book was written. It does draw the reader in and has him/her rooting for certain characters. Also, if you're looking for a book that takes place in Italy, this is not the best one. Most of the book takes place in England."
18529,0,Ok,"These are adequate. They could be better with magnets or weights because they won't lay flat when the wind is blowing, and they can be cumbersome to install."
18532,0,Manifesto?,"This book is only mildly funny and outdated. It seems like a bad rendition of the books he references, like ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius."" The section on mixtapes is uninspired- ""Love is a Mixtape,"" by Rob Sheffield is much more successful. This book produced no mindblowing or even relatively interesting ideas- a waste of time if you ask me."
18540,0,Read with a grain of Salt!,I thought this was a good book that captured my generation in a nutshell. I wouldn't take it too seriously. It was very opinionated...most of which I agreed with. I read a lot of it on the subway and found myself laughing out loud. I definitely dont think I gained any insiteful knowledge from reading the book but found it entertaining.
18541,0,For the road warrior only,This is a good investment if you travel to LARGE cities often. It is quite expensive for the casual traveler for what it delivers.
18554,0,It was what I expected.,"I mainly purchased this book because of the show I watched on the Smithsonian Channel. They talked about how time consuming it was for Mr.Jefferson to cut apart 4 original Bibles and compile them into one, taking out all of what he thought wasn't necessary, mainly the religious Dogmas. It was actually more interesting watching the Smithsonian book experts unbind the entire book, and put it back together, not only to restore it, but to preserve it. I believe it took approximately one year, so I thought I should at least read the book that they felt was important enough to do what they did."
18566,0,Yeah i think this is a great series!,"This is the first in the Legacy of kain i have ever played and yes i like it, this story makes me curious to play trhe others which i hear is better , i must say the glitches piss me off and the controls and actually game at times really can fustrate you. but that does not take away the essense of the game Edios have the tenency to make game with lots of errors and some horrible graphical flaws example Hitman.I will definitely play this series through this game wasn't so bad i love the story or did i mention the terrible Lip sync? ummmmmmmh oh well all in all a passible effot by Edios laters folks and gamers feast on the blod on humans ha ha ha ah!"
18582,0,MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING,Quite an experience but the book is too centered in the psychological aspects---more atuned for psychologists than for the general readership
18583,0,"OK, but there are others I have read better.","My priest recommended this book in a grieving session I was attending. I read most of it, but never finished because it was too technical in the latter part of the book for me. The priest thought it was a terrific book, so it would depend on your view."
18584,0,The Meaning of Logotherapy,"This book was really two books in one. The first part centered on the author's experiences and feelings of suffering as a Holocaust survivor. The terrible pain and indignity came out crystal clear. The second part was less than clear however. Logotherapy was difficult to grasp. Indeed, the author totally lost this reader as to the utility of logotherapy in my life and I would venture to guess that he had the same effect on other readers."
18587,0,My review,"I think Frankl is a excellent writer and therapist. He makes several valid points about how man should go about finding meaning in his life. I especially like how he presented the Meaning of Suffering to the depressed doctor with the analogy of what if the wife died first? Essentially saying that the husband is saving the wife from having to suffer his death by the husband suffering the death of his wife. It is a justified way of looking at suffering. Logotherapy is all about finding meaning in life and the book explains just that but only after a very long, depressing section on his stay at Auschwitz. Although this section is somewhat dry, it is necessary to understnad where he gets his point of view for the remainder of the book."
18588,0,Mans Search for Meaning,"This book on tape was a great review of the psychology of man. As the book deals with issues, philosophies, theories, and hypothesis's I found myself reviewing what makes me tick. I listened to this with my wife and the book generates live discussions, which could lead to revelations."
18590,0,Nice!,"I love this game! It's fun to unlock new bikes and choose you leathers and helmet for your rider. Upgrading the bikes is very nice to say the least. For some reason, the game kind of reminds me of an older Gran Turismo..but for bikes. I like that. You get street bikes and sport bikes of varying sizes and hp. A good number of tracks are there to race on..the ones through the mountainous areas are a lot of fun. I could use some better graphics...the reason for the 3 star overall...but this is an older game after all and well worth a bargin bin price. My one real beef with this game is that there is no in-race music while you are racing. The only music is on replays. That stinks! Oh well. That aside, I highly recommend this bike game."
18593,0,The book was alright,As interesting as the book seemed it lacked the quality to match up to standard of other books I have read lately.
18607,0,"Great Info, Poor Workmanship","This is a must have for any fisherman, novice or experienced. It is an informative guide that is well categorized for quick and comprehensive reference. I am on my third copy because, unfortunately, the volume is not made for use on the water. The binding and pages disintegrate in the humid water environment. Otherwise, I would give it five stars. Don't even get it Wet--it dries into an impenetrable mass. My suggestion to the author is to have two volumes available. One for the home bookshelf, and one made with damp/water resistant pages (possibly spiral-bound) for on the water use. I believe that any serious angler would pay extra for this as it is an invaluable resouce."
18611,0,Keep your mate near by,"It had a good story line. However, it was very detailed (raunchy). Felt it would have still been good reading without all the sexy details."
18615,0,Doing Grammar,Doing Grammar arrived earlier than expected and in ok condition--which is how I bought the book. Needed the book for a college course and it is exactly what I needed.
18624,0,I know he can do better,"There are a few songs on this album that are very good, enjoyable to hear over and over and live (he does a dynamic live show) - but then there are some that are utterly ho-hum and dull. I'd say it's 40/60 in favor of ho-hum...but I love his voice and know that there has to be someone out there who can produce this stellar talent well. Will keep waiting, worth having for those few really good tunes, the others fade away."
18631,0,Smooth listening!,"Very well done. Not as good as Daughtry's, but darn close. His sound is smooth and jazzy. Definitely good riding in the country music!"
18633,0,Not Quite Idol Material,"I loved Elliott during the show and I absolutely felt he was the best singer of the three finalists, so though I liked Taylor Hicks, I was disappointed Mr. Yamin went home. This album doesn't quite capture the full range of Elliott that we got to witness as he blossomed all season. There are a few highlights like Movin' On and Trainwreck. But Song for You is not nearly as intriguing and captivating as his on-stage version and I'm simply under-whelmed by the whole production. I really like you, Elliott, but your CD was a one-listen album for me and now it's just in the CD changer with the other 500+. Unlike the Killers and Carrie Underwood who stayed in the car for weeks, you didn't allure me to want more. Sorry."
18636,0,Good First Album from an Exceptional Singer/entertainer,"I felt that this album was typical to new albums by AI artists. However, Elliot has the chops to have staying power and a long career, IF he gets a better produced album.A comment posted, was that a lot of the songs sound the same or similar. That is a production issue. Not putting in a different variety of songs, choosing songs with different tempos, stylings, etc. It's really not Elliot. But he does need to get more involved with his album.This issue was the same thing hampering Taylor Hicks album. The guys are talented, they just need a bit more variety.If you like Elliot Yamin - you'll enjoy the album.If you like R&B; - you'll enjoy the album.Just remember it is a debut cd, and hopefully going forward we'll see more originallity and variety in the song selections. (Jewel also had this problem on her first album as well)."
18640,0,Good...but what's with the editing?,"Having caught a second wind, Perry continues what she started in Seven Dials by taking familiar characters to new and exciting places (psychologically speaking.) She's really revitalized the series. However, I wonder if she's switched editors with this one, and for the worse. I noticed a large number of typos and either clunky or downright erroneous wordings that never existed in the previous Pitt novels. It was distracting enough for me to knock one star off my review."
18643,0,Fridge - The Sun,"Fridge returns with _The Sun_, another foray into the complexities of post-rock. So even while the title track sounds skeletal -- percussion, flute and feedback -- it segues into the more melodic ""Clocks"" and the understated ""Our Place in This."" The drum machine, piano chords and electronic squeal of ""Comets"" propels us into outer space, but in the overall album, something seems to be missing. Sure, the country twang of ""Years and Years and Years..."" is lovely, but the same sense of discovering beauty and sustaining it just doesn't seem to be there. Maybe it just got momentarily hidden by the sun."
18649,0,Game works,"The game works and i got it as a gift for somebody and they enjoy it as it brings them back good old memories, it was pretty used and the case was so-so, for its price and the fact it works, it got my 3, thanks again."
18666,0,Where's the DETAIL!!!!,"I have been a tremendous fan of WoT since 7th grade (seemingly ancient history as I move on to college). I loved everyone of his books. They are imaginative, detailed, and, most importantly, consistent. RJ never loses the main plot though he works on several subplots at the same time. If this is the case, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED!!!! The book went no where. He has not started to reslove any of the plot matters. And what pissed me off the most is how he skimmed over the Nyneve and Lan thing like it was of no interest. Their love has been boiling for 6 books and we don't even see the wedding!!! The next book ought to be brilliant lest I become more pissed!"
18671,0,Female Issues?,"If you like books concerning mean spirited, narcisistc, condescending, arrogant, man hating women....then by all means read these books.Every time there is something said by a woman, 9 times out of 10 it's a nasty comment about men. It's very predictable now. When I see, for example, Nynaeve says, ""......text..."", I know it's gonna be something nasty. There is no if's, and's or but's....it will always be something nasty. So I just roll my eyes and skim,or skip through that part. Maybe that's good after all, since it makes the 900+ page book go by quicker.I can't understand how there are actually pregnancies & children in this bizzarro world of man haters.I think Robert Jordan has real female issues. Maybe his Mother was mean, or he got dumped by his girlfriend in High School...I don't know. But the way he portrays women is disturbing."
18677,0,great novel horrible copy,"I just love Robert Jordan, however I simply can't believe that the publisher has the gall to charge such inflated fees for digital copies of books available in paperback with so very many typos in them."
18682,0,"Too Much Plot, Not Enough Action,","Jordan's latest book in the series got off to a very slow start, and never seemed to really take off as the others have. The plot seemed to truly get bogged down with way too many details. The novel just didn't excite me the way the other novels in the series did."
18684,0,"great series , long winded,to long between novels","I must say that it is a very good story, but I find him quite long winded. I'm not sure if some of those book need to be that long. There seems to be a lot of wasted paper.I really think that Robert Jordan is just stringing us along to make more cash. For that reason I'm not sure that I will buy the next one. Like I said I like the story.?!?!?!?!?!"
18687,0,Too long yet I still read them,"This book was not very good. Jordan's writing has dropped off over the last four books and the only thing that keeps me reading is the fact that I am a sucker for a complex plot. And that is one thing this series does have. In book 7 of a supposedly 10 book series, Jordan still managed to introduce a completely new and powerful character, bring back another, and refrain from introducing another major player in the events to come. I can't imagine this series ending at 10. If someone is thinking about reading the series, I suggest that if you like almost any fantasy book, no matter what, read this series. To those who need the great writing of Tolkien, stay well away"
18694,0,great story but needs less words more progress per book,"I've read them all so far. I like the story I just wish he would use half as many words. Very little really happened in this particular volume. Also, one woould expect by now that the women in the story would have seen enough of the world to lose their obsession with nudity. That gets a little tedious and is a great way to cut out hundreds of pages. Seven huge volumes is really enough to have told the whole story through the final battle"
18701,0,"Good Game, but just a smidgen too hard","This was a great game, but there are some drawbacks. The game is just too incredibly hard for the limited number of lives, and the boss battles (Particularly on the bridge of Immortality) are repetetive. A good game overall, buy it!"
18702,0,Does it work the other way around?,"I haven't bought this product yet, but I will shortly since I have 2 PS1 controllers laying around. I was just wondering if a Gamecube controller will be able to play a PS2. I seem to prefer the Gamecube contoller over PS2 since I've been playing Game Cube all the time. If u have tried and don't recamend it or anything else that could go wrong with this thing, please just post another review."
18705,0,Individual sequences are noteworthy in this collection,"This is an interesting collection in that each film dates from a different period in the Stooges' career. ANTS IN THE PANTRY is the earliest, a fine comedy with the Stooges as exterminators who are thoroughly prepared for the job. A-DUCKING THEY DID GO has an informal bit in which the cast harmonizes on the Stooges' vaudeville standard ""Tears"" (""You'll never know...""); this charming, impromptu bit is the best thing in the movie. THREE LITTLE TWIRPS is the latest and least of this assortment, with the Stooges crashing a circus. Not their best, but Curly is memorable as the bearded lady. Overall, a decent package deal, and as good an assortment as you're likely to see on television."
18706,0,SLowly arrived,"Items were in excellent condition however, they didn't arrive when needed....snail mail was the only option and requests to pay for expedite mail unanswered. Had to buy books at school, now we have two excellent copies :("
18707,0,Your Tax Dollars At Work,"This book made me incredibly angry. In a nutshell, it is the horrifying story of one woman's life and legacy of ignorance, immorality, illegality, and vice. It's a very compelling read and well-written in terms of the subject matter, but there is a consistent theme throughout the book of ""failure of the system,"" which I found insulting considering Rosa Lee and her family's grave manipulation, exploitation, and abuse of every helping hand extended."
18708,0,Still Waiting...,"I got this game on Christmas day after I got my Playstation on Christmas eve and I was so excited about it. But when I played it, it took such a long time to load:( that's one of the cons the other is the darn timer!!!!!!!! If you get this it won't be the end of the world but befor you do rent it."
18709,0,Rush,"This game is okay, if you like car racing. it's a good game. it takes a while to load. the graphics are okay. it's addictive, depending on where you are in the game."
18716,0,Funtasma Shoes,"These shoes are okay, they are poorly cut and cramp my toes, though. I use them just as ""costume"" shoes as they are wearable for short periods only."
18721,0,Adventurous,"Not as strong of a story. More of a formula movie. Good visuals, but Pitch Black is the better show."
18726,0,"""Sucked, But In A Good Way""","What I mean is this film is one of the best action films of the year, and I'm not comparing this to Kill Bill. ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" has no character development, no plot, in fact the video game is way better. In fact all Vin diesel does is trash talk, show his muscles, and adds no demension to the character. I want to know more about Riddick, I want to think more about Riddick, did he have a family before he became what he is, or are they just going to subject us to mindless action and no plot. Hopefully they'll add a third intallment, so I can find out. This film needs better acting and more meaning behind the action. ""Kill Bill"" showed that behind all of that blood thirsty action that there was a love story in the middle of it all. Why can't we get the same treatment and let it be entertaining as well."
18729,0,Not bad.......but not good,"Though I found The Chronicles of Ridddick seemed to be a good idea when first heard about, I found the execution to be lacking and was sorely disappointed. The concept is great, but there are so many plot holes and the characters are so uninteresting that I could have cared less. It seems to be a wasted effort, though I appreciate the ambitious storyline. The whole thing seems to come off as mediocre at best. I thought it could have been done much better and they COULD have achieved the original grand sci-fi film that they were hoping to make, which would be nice considering how many movies these days are rehashed from comics and books. Perhaps the DVD release will make up for what the theatrical release lacked. Better luck next time guys."
18732,0,Good popcorn movie...,"I would say that Pitch Black, the low budget original classic is much better than TCOR. This movie is a large budget attempt to re-capture on a sequal. I reminds me of Fast and the Furious vs Too Fast Too Furious. Boy stick to the original first movie. But the sequal is only a rental. I would say Dark Fury is worth the price though. These new in between DVDs are more interesting and fun."
18734,0,A good basic guide,"These audubon guides are good basic guides. We got them to identify butterflies, insects and spiders in our midwestern back yard. It is often difficult to find the bugs we are looking for. We've had much more luck with Kenn Kaufman's ""Field Guide to Insects of North America"". In some ways it's more user friendly, with lots of bugs photos on one page and descriptions that are on the opposing text page. The Audubon guide is set up so that you have to flip back and forth between images in one section and text/description in another - which can be tedious - however, the Audubon descriptions are much more thorough than Kaufman's."
18743,0,Has Russell Crowe EVER let us down?,"There are certainly enough reviews here that give the gist of the plot, so I'll just give my opinion. I enjoyed this film because of the male stars and in spite of the female ones. Crowe, Morse, and Caruso are completely believable and intriguing. Ryan and Reed (who played her sister-in-law) are so bad they kept reminding me I was watching acting. The men could have acted opposite styrofoam dummies and done as well. It's amazing to see Crowe's Terry Thorne yearn for Ryan's Alice Bowman, whose own facial expressions reflect an awkward, gassy discomfort. Loved the film's climactic scene--excellently written, choreographed, filmed, and acted. Worth watching. The three stars are for the men. The two missing stars are for the women."
18747,0,GOod...,"I didn't give a dime for this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised after watching it. It's no masterpiece at all, far, far away from it, but Crowell, Morse, Caruso and ryan givestraighforward performances, no bullshi... included. Entertaining, if not phenomenal by any standards."
18756,0,The Great Mouse DEFECTIVE,"I had thought that Disney would never ruin their product when released on Blu-ray, since that format is all about QUALITY. I was wrong. Once again, the IDIOTS at Disney have ruined another glorious movie. This movie was filmed in a 1:66-1 aspect ratio. It won't take the viewer long to discover that foreheads and feet are cut in half or missing altogether in many scenes. I'M MAD, MAD, MAD!!!!!!!!!!!! WALT DISNEY EMPLOYEES, are you listening? STOP MESSING WITH THE ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIOS. Just because it's there, doesn't mean you have to FILL IT!"
18767,0,Get the 3-disc version,"There is also a 3-disc version of Apocalypse Now available as a limited-time Circuit City promotion. The third disc contains a trailer for each version of the movie, a short documentary (7 minutes), and the missing ""Destruction of the Kurtz Compound"" scene both with and without commentary from F. Coppola. The third disc comes in a sleeve inserted into the packaging. There is a sticker on the packaging indicating the presence of the third disc (""while supplies last"").I don't know if this material was intentionally withheld from the DVD solely for the purposes of this promotion, but if so, that is very disappointing and frustrating!"
18768,0,Not as good as the original theatrical release,"This film has been recut with an extra 45 minutes. None of the scens added are particularily good except the extra Marlon Brando scene and the french plantation scene. But the film could do with out those also. Many of the new scenes like the play boy bunnies and teh stealing of the surfboard are to the detriment of the story and the characters. Still even this cut is better than most films out there. Good to see out of interest sake, but will always watch the original release for satisfaction."
18771,0,"Great movie, bad DVD","This is my favorite movie of all time, so my rating certainly doesn't reflect on the quality of the movie at all, rather the DVD design. This is a two disc set and instead of putting the original on one DVD and the Redux on the other DVD they put the first half of both versions on disc 1 and the second half on disc 2. I think this ruins the flow of the movie because you have to get up and load the other dvd halfway through the movie. LAME!"
18776,0,The redux adds almost nothing to the original,"Some of the new stuff was just plain silly, including another encounter with the Playboy bunnies. The only thing that the redux really adds is a scene in which Brando reads news clippings to Martin Sheen, and even then the value is limited. Still, it's a great movie worth seeing on the wide screen, but don't expect cinemagraphic satori."
18777,0,"Error in production of disc 2, additional scenes section","I love this movie and it looks great on Blu-ray. Seeing Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, and Marlon Brando in a movie made over 30 years ago looking like they filmed it last year (it was that well re-mastered) was a truly mind-boggling experience. BUT, there seems to be an error in disc 2 in the Additional Scenes section. All of the scenes are cut off in the screen, you can only see the bottom 4th of the screen and the rest is blacked out, clearly a mistake, but other features on the disc are fine. Did anyone else experience this???"
18788,0,Apocalyptic Letdown,"After waiting a year or so for this extended-version of ""Apocalypse Now,"" I must say that I was a bit disappointed. The image and audio transfer are quite good but the additional footage (while enjoyable to watch) did not add anything to the overall film. If anything, it’s a distraction as the scenes interrupted the flow of the story line. Martin Sheen's character is shown to have more depth but his detached nature (in the original) is diluted with spurts of camaraderie in this newer version.I guess my biggest complaint is ""Why-why-why no additional features??"" Sure, director's commentaries take time to put together but at least throw the public a bone or two. The ""Hearts of Darkness"" documentary wouldn't need any cleaning up and would have been an ideal extra for this DVD. (...)Paramount sure made out with this bare-bones disc - but next time, I'll be a bit more frugal when it comes to buying their discs."
18793,0,"Didn't use it, too big for our smaller car.","This car seat base would be fine if we owned a larger vehicle with a little more room in the backseat. The base tends to elevate the car seat and angles it forward so that the front seat tends to be more cramped than usual. The reason I bought it was to make placing the infant car seat in our backseat a little easier since we only have two doors, but in the end it was just didn't work. We just buckled the baby in every time and left the base at home."
18794,0,VHS Quality on a DVD,"I expected something special with the DVD version, but the quality is the same as a new VHS tape, and worse, there are no extras of any sort. If you are buying this as a collector, you may want to hold off. If you just have to have this on DVD, like I did, then buy it."
18798,0,The best of Macy,Even it is a good album with really good soul and funk elements you can get bored very quickly to listen it.
18799,0,"A pleasure, a revelation, a joy...","There's some catchy stuff on here, and it was certainly refreshing at the time it came out.Now though she's beenovertaken by the superior technical talents of the likes of Jill Scott, and Erykah Badu's latest record puts poor Macy in her place. Worth listening to, though, and there's every chance you'll love it."
18800,0,Very Unique!,"When I first heard ""Do Something"" on our local jazz station, I fell in love with the voice, song, and beat. I got another chance to see her perform on on t.v. and I loved it! The Latin, sort of urban rhythm to ""I've Committed Murder"" took me! All of her lyrics tell a real story."
18801,0,"Macy Shares ""Life""","One great thing about having teenage sons...you gain perspective on some of the newer music. My oldest son turned me on to Macy Gray.She's funky, she's gritty, she's raw. And I like that. The tracks on ""On How Life Is"" are somewhat similar in beat and rhythms, however the lyrics she has written scan many ideas; from sex, to love to indignation.We recently lost our 14 yr old family dog, Taylor. The song, ""I Try"", has become our anthem to him. ""....try to say good-bye & I choke..try to walk away & I stumble...it's clear, my world crumbles when you are not near...""So, stay open, enjoy life, and seek out Macy Gray's debut CD!Thanks--CDS"
18803,0,Great Lyrics! Music Needs Some Work,The Lyrics and the feelings of Macy Gray are terrific. They express her feelings and are universal in content. This would be a great CD if not for the music. It is repetitive and has that annoying beat that seems to be in all R&B music these days.
18811,0,Bad design,"Camera has a fatal design flaw - the zoom lens assembly is fragile, locks up and malfunctions easily. If camera is out of warranty repair costs $119. I am on my second repair, when the zoom lens breaks the third time I'll be ready for a new camera from a different manuafacturer."

I recommend just renting it and not purchasing it."
18822,0,twice the pie,"very funny, very rude and crude , and if college boys in America are all about sex and little else as depicted in this film, then..well, thats too bad...Jim's dad was definately a highlight, and the original cast were all there, less innocent, more daring and more everything they were in the first. At times you might find yourself thinking 'okay..this is too much..'but the film quickly redeems itself when it finds it's heart again and regains some balance . A good helping of something else, like in scenes between Michelle and Jim . overall, a fun excursion for the under thirties."
18824,0,"I hate to admit it, but it's funny.","Really funny, actually-- I only gave it three stars because it was not nearly as good as the first one, nor as witty as I like comedies to be. But to suspend reality for an hour and a half, to put your worries aside, and laugh at the asinine jokes-- it's worth it. For all of you escapists out there, watch this movie."
18836,0,Too many cooks?,"This movie is a legendary mess - Roger Corman wrapped filming on THE RAVEN early, and not wishing to waste a castle set and the remainder of Boris Karloff's contract, started a gothic movie, then handed this unfinished flick to a series of proteges to complete. Jack Hill, Francis Ford Coppola, and Monte Hellman all took cracks at trying to make sense of an unfinished script. THE TERROR is often referred to as a movie without a plot - there's a plot in there alright, but you've got to be prepared to fight for it. Worth seeing if only for the combination of Karloff and an alarmingly young Jack Nicholson."
18846,0,Mountains of money kept me afloat,"I own a small record shop, and this album saved my hide last year when it came out. The newer, spiffier Musicland opened just across the street some 18 months ago, and, as you might imagine, its broad selection and lower prices nearly put me out of business. With a wife and three kids to support, this was not a promising time in my life.Enter Bon Jovi's ""Slippery When Wet.""As stated, this album singlehandedly saved my shop from going bankrupt. In point of fact, I could barely keep it in stock. And while I myself don't much care for this loud style of music, I've got to admit that this Jon Bon Jovi guy is on to something. Thanks for saving my hide, Mr. Jovi.The new Def Leppard comes out later this year. Be interesting to see how it does."
18848,0,"Wonderful cast, interesting story. Distracting soundtrack.","It's too bad such an interesting, well acted story was waylaid by the constant barrage of anachronistic music, costume design and dialog. There were so many good things to recommend this movie, but every time they would break into a rock song or the lead love interest would show up with magenta streaked hair, the net effect was jarring. I'm glad we rented rather than bought this one!"
18852,0,1500s,"This is the story of a jousting knight at the end of the Middle Ages and begining of the Renaissance. As if the Middle Ages were so cool. Plus a pulse pounding metal score make it worth seeing for knights in armor devotees. It's not bad, i kindas liked it."
18854,0,A lame but Rock and Roll fairy tale,"""A Knight's Tale"" is a silly little movie that has a rock and roll heart and soundtrack. It's a bit offbeat in that sense. Hearing ""We will Rock you"" in a knight movie seemed a bit strange to me at first, but I just decided to try and enjoy this movie for what it was...a somewhat laid back attempt at a fairy tale romance involving a jousting knight and the beautiful girl he falls for. It had a few laughs and the actors were all fine. It isn't meant to be taken too seriously, it's just a fun movie that happens to have Heath ledger as it's main character. He is certainly as good an actor as he is good looking. FOR YOU DIE HARD HEATH FANS: this is a must see!!he is perfectly charming as ""William"", who wants to be a Knight, fight the bad guy, and win the girl.It was a little predictable, but cute.Worth a rental fee."
18856,0,SILLY FUN,"Heath Ledger confirms his star potential in this fluffy, midbrow-concept fable, which is utterly predictable. His performance is one of the more compelling elements in this corny story, set in a nameless medieval jousting era. The fun concept of using 70s rock tunes such as WE WILL ROCK YOU and TAKIN' CARE OF BUSINESS is never exploited fully, and so falls flat, with the single exception of a delightful dance sequence set to David Bowie's GOLDEN YEARS -- for a few moments, the movie musical comes back to life. One wishes the movie went full-tilt into the anachronistic fun of music and story/setting -- it might have been a camp classic while rousing pre-fab emotion. As it is, A KNIGHT'S TALE has its limited appeal, but is only half-baked."
18859,0,What were they thinking?,"If you can ignore the occasional modern-day outfits clumsily juxtaposed into the medieval scene, and the fight scene at the end, the movie is not too bad. Not great, mind you, but not too bad. See it when you have a party (a girl's slumber party), and can afford to talk through the really silly parts. See it if you think that the knight is ""oh so dreamy"". See it for some of the cool fight scenes ... but don't expect much. One can only wonder at its potential amusement value to MST3K fans."
18862,0,disappointingly unrealistic,"The setting for the movie was supposed to be midevil Europe, but it wasn't very midevil. Since when do peasents chant ""we will rock you""? Other than the setting it was OK, but it was definitly a chick flick. The romance between the hero and the noble woman did not fit in with the action and jousting. If you don't mind a misplaced romance or midevil cheerleaders this movie is alright."
18864,0,Overall Not That Bad,"Overall not that bad of a flick, but to me, as with others, the intrusion of the modern music really hurt this film. Still it's nice to see an American movie from this current decade set in the past, and the scene in which the camera flew over a panoramic fourteenth-century London was worth an Amazon star in and of itself. Heath Ledger is likable here as everywhere, and the sub-story of Geoffrey Chaucer's pseudo-inspiration for his own Knight's Tale added some much needed grounding to what might otherwise have been way too free-flying a production."
18867,0,"Mixed feelings, scary yet predictable","I really have mixed feelings concerning this movie. It is kind of thrilling and scary but at the same time too predictable. I guess that if you are the type of person who likes to figure out what is going to happen before it does, this would be good for you. It does have a twist at the end if you haven't been following the movie too closely. A definite rental for a Halloween party.A group of friends from school suddenly start ending up murdered, along with a lot of other people! Is it the nerd from their past who they all suspect? Or is that just what someone wants them to think? Put your detective skills to use and crack this mystery before everyone else watching it with you does!"
18872,0,A well written book,"The book is okay and is well written, but I would be severely puffing if I said it should be a must read,"
18874,0,"Dated, But a Further Taste of Kane and Abel","I was happy to read this book because it was so hard to come to the end of its predecessor, Kane and Abel. The latter was a better book and in Daughter there seemed to be a lot of formulaic replays in presenting the characters and what they'll do next. When it was written, the idea of a female president thrilled the American imagination as we had had a real contender for that happening in our country. Now, with a black man in the White House and women's lib a bit of a banality (with Rupert Murdoch, the inspiration for a character in another Archer novel, The Fourth Estate, rapidly feminizing the Wall Street Journal as we speak) this story's innovative edge has been lost. Still, as with all Jeffery Archer's tales, it offers an entertaining escape by a writer who knows how to put together a decent read."
18879,0,it's just ok,"this is an ok movie with a couple of funny moments, but leaves you wanting. If your real bored, then it might get the job done."
18881,0,Funny and dramatic real life tie in,Hall Pass starts out as the typical comedy and ends up a drama that illustrates the fact that the grass is NOT always greener on the other side. The movie has some great funny scenes and I believe it factually portrays that a spouse may feel there are better options out there when they should be happy with what and who they have. It's a good movie with comedy and a good message overall.
18882,0,Not A Life Changing Event Movie,"The Farrellys ruled the roost in the Nineties with ""There's Something About Mary"" their masterwork. Somewhere around ""Stuck On You"" they lost their way. Meanwhile Jud Apatow and Todd Phillips passed the boys in the outrageous comedy department. The Farrellys try to reclaim their throne here but no dice. They appropriate elements of Apatow and Phillips with some of their own fluorish but it's an uneasy mixture. This is far from a bad film but it's hardly a good one. I did like Owen Wilson but Jason Sudeikis was something of an oaf. This is a case of the Farrellys being victims of their previous success and being overcome by their progeny."

18889,0,A Muddled Map,"While this movie offers a terrific performance by Julianne Moore, Signourney Weaver's highly praised interpretation of Alice Goodwin was somewhat uneven. The movie itself suffers from inconsistency, mostly because Alice's motives and attitudes aren't always easy to interpret. It's a frustrating experience, watching ""A Map of the World."" For every powerhouse scene, there's an awkward, muted one. In the end, I don't know how well Weaver conveyed what Alice was supposed to have gained from her troubling experiences. She still seemed somewhat caustic and distant. Was it the screenplay or the direction? Whatever the reaason, this is an uneven and frustrating film, full of good moments and weak ones."
18893,0,it's a hoot!,"All while I was reading this book I could hear the soundtrack of a 1937 black and white movie. This book has all the elements of a sappy, romantic one, which includes a patriotic view of the war. It has the stilted language of a B movie script. The author even gets Clark Gable, David Niven and Hedda Hopper to do cameo roles. If that isn't enough he gets Bugsy Siegel to make a menacing appearance. Mr. Woods warps history to make the story work, well almost.Even with all this it is still an enjoyable ride in a cream convertible, with the top down."

I'm more into Tori Amos, Indigo Girls, etc. etc. I also must admit that one of the reasons I bought this CD was because Missy Elliot helped out (though not very much help at all, I later learned) on one of the tracks...and Bills, Bills, Bills caught my attention. The slow songs on this CD, for the most part...SUCK. There are some really tight songs though. Jumpin' Jumpin', Where'd you go?, Bills, Bills, Bills (of course...probably the tightest), So Good, and Hey Ladies. I say, buy a Tori Amos CD and borrow Writing's on the Wall from someone else :o)."

18931,0,"Fascinating, Overbearing","A fascinating catch-all of every possible JFK conspiracy theory. Brilliantly made and edited, the narrated flashbacks are dazzling examples of cinema. Unfortunately, every now and then characters have to sit and talk to each other, and the writing becomes laughable. Poor Sissy Spacek bears the brunt of it, as Jim Garrison's neglected wife who dares to look askance at her husband awakening in the middle of the night with assassination on his lips.Also, the film insists that it's own particular view of the events that took place at Dealy Plaza are the only accurate ones, and that anyone who dares to think otherwise is a dupe, and hence a conspirator, and part of the problem rather than the solution, and so on. Since when did Oliver Stone get the monopoly on Truth?"
18932,0,Interesting but implausible,"The viewer is left with a lot of questions, the biggest one being: ""So, WHO exactly was responsible for the assassination of John F. Kennedy?"" Oliver Stone offers an extremely complex, incredibly unconvincing argument that the CIA, exiled Cubans, the Mafia and big business were somehow all involved. William of Occam could offer a much more likely theory, but that story wouldn't have been as interesting. Still worth seeing, but don't take it seriously."
18942,0,Sophia times three,"This DVD is unusual in that it contains three separate and unrelated stories. Sophia is, was and always will be an icon of the cinema. Her looks have not faded as have those of so many others. She is almost timeless. I would not rate this particular DVD as amongst her best work, but it is worth watching. Marcello Mastroianni is also a legendary performer."
18946,0,Good Action; Simple Plot,"Well, it ain't no terminator but there is pretty good special effects and good action. Kurt says maybe 50 words throughout the whole movie but he certainly did bulk up for the role. Worth renting."
18947,0,Realistic... But need MORE 'surprising' action stunts!,"Kurt Russel plays the 'old-fashioned, obsolete' soldier whose squad got 'replaced' by a better team. And towards the end, he alone, single-handedly, down-ed the whole 'other' squad before setting course for refuge, at the Trinity Moons.Being a fan of science-fiction movies, i might be biased in saying that this is a good movie to spend your weekend watching.However, much of what's portrayed in the movie, i believe is already in practice in the military workforce. So much for the 'tough-guys' thang ! :p"
18952,0,Much Maligned Film Deserves to Be Seen,"Critically smashed at the time and DOA at the box office, Soldier was one a huge run of mega budgeted flops Warner Bros released in 1997 & 1998. But the suprise is how good this by the numbers sci-fi actioner really is.Kurt Russell gives one of his most phenomenal performances as the emotionally stunted lead character. It's a true tour de force of cinematic acting-he hardly says a word, but his eyes, expression and body language surge through the screen.Paul WS Anderson's direction is efficient and tight, it's more his approach to the the look and feel of the material that's the problem. David Webb People's script is terrific and you can't help but wonder what Ridley Scott or John McTiernan might have be able to do with this.This is kind of an 80's throwback that you could imagine being an absolute blockbuster for Schwarzenegger in his prime- but it's 10 years too late, despite the brilliant work of it's star."
18959,0,POEMS,"If you want a spectacular book this isn't quit for you. I didnt love this book because it is written in poetry and most of the parts are dull and boring. But it can Also be sad at times. When You think of Love That Dog would you think that it would be mostly about a dog but only half of the book talks about a dog and the other half talks about poems. So I guess this book is half and half but if you like battles and things like, once again this book isn't for you."
18960,0,"A Picture of Poems -- a review by Chris, age 10","Love that Dog is about a boy named Jack who had a dog that died, and now he is writing in his poem journal, but he believes that poetry is not for boys. Yeah, right. He writes some beginner's poetry but they are inspired by other professional poetry, and he gets better and more confident at writing poetry throughout the book. He writes poems inspired by the works of Robert Frost, Arnold Adoff and many more.This is a book of humor and poetry, similar to Amelia's Notebook and a Shel Silverstein book combined. The author writes this way because emotions are better expressed in poetry than in prose. It shows young writers how to get ideas inspired by another author. It is a good book for people who like letter books where the whole book is letters. It is for young readers who like poetry. This is a very good book by a very good author."
18967,0,Mediocre film with a good Belushi performance,"SEPARATE LIVES is the story of an ex-cop turned psychology student (JAMES BELUSHI) and his professor (LINDA HAMILTON) who asks him to follow her for a few days because she's been blacking out and waking up in strange situations. He discovers that she's living a double life, and that she is involved in a recent murder case as well as a 20-year old murder case.Hamilton delivers a solid performance, easily slipping from one personality to another. Belushi, however, is the real impetus behind the film. This is the first film I've seen him carry, and he does it deftly.The story is mostly predictable with a few clunky twists and turns, but it ends satisfyingly. Having viewed a lot of ""thrillers"" in the past few years, I can say that this one is in the top half of those. Belushi's performance is what makes the film worth watching -- he gives a great performance in an otherwise mediocre film."
18968,0,Uneven but excellent at times,Still for my money the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band is one of the great bands of the 60s. They are up there with Love bidding for the greatest overlooked band of the 60s. This CD is not their best due to its uneveness. It does however have some ***** songs. It is hard to find a some better 60s classic than the 'Smell of Incense'. 'In the Arena' and the classic 'What If They Had a War and Nobody Came' are well worth the money. The rest of the material is hit or miss.

The package only comes with ankle weights, red and green exercise bands (not yellow), and the 2 discs seen pictured. There are no instructions or work out plans or anything. I thought there would be a calendar or something like the infomercial shows to tell you when to do each work out but there isn't. I guess you are just left to randomly do the workouts."
18988,0,Many recipes don't work,"I am an experienced bread machine baker (over 10 years). While many of the recipes in this book are excellent, beware of the ingredients ratios. In my machine I had to cut back a lot on tne yeast. I used both the recommended SAF and Fleishmans Bread machine yeast with similar over-risen results. My pages are filled with notes on ingredient and baking modificatiobns. You may have to adjust your proportions according to your machine or do the baking solely in the oven after an observed rise. I even had a case of oven baking where the loaf ""exploded"" out of the baking pan due to way too much yeast."
18994,0,Good Book,I purchased this book at the same time I purchased my bread maker. It's good book. Very well written and easy to read. Some of the bread making ingredients are pretty hard to find in my area of the country but I've enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others.
18995,0,One major weakness!,The recipes and information about breads and flours are extensive. It's fun reading.Major weakness: The recipes are written in a small font on a medium green background. Even with my normal reading glasses I have to use a magnifying glass to distinguish numbers in the fractions of cups.This means that I will have to type the recipe and print it out in an easily readable font size. I will not be able to assemble the ingredients straight from the book.
19007,0,Perverted sex and graphic violence for the history buff,The third book in a series that puts the myth of Camelot in a real historical context. Plenty of action and a very clever interweaving of myth and reality. The violence of the times is graphically described with lots of blood and guts being spilled. This volume includes descriptions of violent sexual perversions that you may consider unsuitable for younger readers - a thought to keep in mind if you are thinking of buying this as a gift. For adults that want an all action historical novel this will probably not disappoint. Very similar to the Bernard Cornwell series of King Alfred novels but with rather more explicit sex.

What they don't know is that a monsterous cannibal , an Anthropophagus (original title) is stalking them and eating them one by one. Although the US cut doesn't include the vicious fetus eating scene or the gut munching finale, this film is still an effective thriller, and a bit more cerebral than the traditional Friday the 13th genre slasher which is a surprise considering that it was filmed by Joe D'Amato, the king of the Italian C-movie."

19023,0,Still practicing,"You immediately realize that this is an early Delaware novel. It seems as if Kellerman was still practicing then. He did not create the convincing characters we can find in his later novels when he wrote this book. And the plot is a little heavy, too. The climax is somewhat forced and improbable and comes before the actual ending, which is too transparent and obvious. We know exactly what is coming. Nevertheless, the book is quite a good read, a simple thriller, not too demanding, and it cannot cope with later novels by Kellerman."

There isn't much here, but there are some good mecha.I find the Altron Custom stunning, or stunning for Gundam Wing. Sure, it's very much like the Dragon Gundam from G Gundam, but it's been um. done in a better animated, visually appealing way. Then there's that fight, between Wing Zero Custom (lol) and the Altron Custom. Ok, the Deathscythe Hell was BAD, it had a scythe, with TWO BLADES! Sandrock was ok, Heavyarms was terrible, you get the picture.In this ""Special Edition"" version, you get Minami Takayama (Two Mix's) ""Last Impression"" enjoy it. It's the BEST part of the movie.Fairly good ending, sort of, better than I expected. I'm not telling you to go buy it, but it looks good on the shelf."
19041,0,The Animal,"I was very disappointed by this film. I loved ""Duce Biggalo"" and I was looking forward to the same sort of comedy. However, this movie wasn't nearly as funny as I'd hoped. It was riddled with mediocre acting. The acting combined with a poor story made for a rather brain dead movie. The only bright spots in the movie were Guy Torre and an all too brief appearance by Norm MacDonald. I'd watch it if it came on television, but I would not recommend renting or buying this film."
19044,0,Better than you'd think,"Critics have pretty much universally trashed all movies written by/starring SNL alumni from the early '90s, but 'The Animal' sits up there with 'Billy Madison' and 'Happy Gilmore' as a solidly absurdist comedy. While not a classic, there's enough sustained ""smart"" dumb humor to make it definitely worthwhile. I've seen too many movies that catered towards the Lowest Common Denominator at every turn. While this one was definitely sold as such, it's much more a case of dumb humor for smart people.And that Colleen is too darn cute. Her awkward performance was saved in the editing (watch as no dialogue shots stay on her for too long... if at all), but the camera definitely loves her."

The rest of the fellowship gets the Ents (trees) to help destroy Isengard and Gandalf come back. I would recommend this book more to adults becaus they talk alot and some parts get boring. But some parts are good and make you keep reading. I recommend this book to 10 year olds and up.

They are given close attention and clear analysis, with the exception that clearer maps/graphics would have been a plus. This campaign is interesting in that both sides accused the other of killing wounded men, mutilating the dead and other atrocities, accusations which the author reports but does not explore."

A large black permanent marker was used to mark a line down the side of the book along the edges of the pages. I looked in the book to see what was wrong with it and a few of the pages were smeared but still legible. There should have been some indication that it was defective and what the defect was. I am assuming that new means new. New with a defect needs to be made clear. This is misleading."
19077,0,"Some nostalgia, but not enough","I would rate this lower if the rating were based simply on how I felt about the book.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was easy to read, mildly entertaining, and terribly familiar. I can't tell if the entertainment came from familiarity or not - so much of Alice is simply part of cultural memory that I knew it without ever having read the book. It was silly, but for a time, it progressed. Alice was trying to get into the garden and was exploring the nonsense world as she went along.Through the Looking Glass was different. I had a hard time reading it. I didn't find it entertaining. The pieces made no sense together, and the goal of becoming a queen by making it to the eighth square seemed an afterthought. It may be that Through the Looking Glass was a better dream narrative (it certainly seemed a good example of the kind of play young children engage in), but I still had a hard time reading it."
19084,0,Simplistic at the root - you probably already know it !!,"Griner gives accurate statistics which support his theories (and teaches of the reality of western medicine & north american fads). He looks at how the whole physiology effects the body (something many therapist miss) which enables the treament of the cause - not the symptom. After reading through to the end, you'll find that his technique is simply Cyriax frictions alternating with tappotment. I think the greatest tool of this book with an R.M.T. in mind is a reminder that too much is detramental."

Nikon probably makes more profit selling replacement hoods than they do on the lenses. The only good thing is that they are better than the off brand alternatives. The Fujifilm hoods (which don't mount on Nikon lenses unfortunately) are about twice as thick and latch much better."
19090,0,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM WOODS,"If you bought Chiefs to read the style you know of Stuart's writing you would be disappointed as I was. I am glad his writing improved to the style we see him in his more current work. Chiefs was not what I expected. The publisher said ""this volume will be a collector's treasure for all fans of Stuart Woods"" and I could not agree less. If this had been the first Stuart Woods book I read I would not have read all is other more current works. The Stone Barrington books and the stories in new Mexico and good well written thrillers with some goos associate to reality in them. The Chiefs just did not have that for me. Thank goodness I found his more likeable work in current issues."
19096,0,Key Organizer,It is just like it says it should be. I should have read the dimensions. The photos make it look much much larger than it is. If you are really wanting something for organizing keys I would suggest something larger. Keys literally hang on top of each other in this one.
19106,0,Entertaining,"This movie was just okay. I did not really like the cast. Having a mother like that these days would end me up in foster care, so not really realistic to me."
19122,0,"if your going to steal,don't get caugh.","pretty good movie and lots of action.i like james belushi in almost everything.but stealing from your boss is not a good idea to start with,but when it's 12 mil.,and he'a gangster.that can be the kiss of death."
19124,0,Bizzare stuff from the Bus man,"This is one of the Bus man's strangest films. Our man, for reasons never made clear, is known as ""Friendless"" and is so despised that when he puts his arm around a dog, the dog walks away in disgust. Following Horace Greely's famous saying ""Go west young man,"" he does that and even though he can't milk a cow or saddle a horse, somehow gets a job as a cowhand. Still abused by all of mankind, he does an ""androcles and the lion"" bit (as he did in ""Three Ages"" with a lion) with a cow named ""Brown Eyes"" and and last finds a friend. I'll let you see the rest for yourself. But this is really strange stuff, and the ending (""I Want her."" You'll see what I mean.) will leave a particularly odd taste in your mouth."
19126,0,"Would Be Brilliant, Except....","I purchased this DVD and had to return it because I thought that it had a manufacturing defect. The first 4 tracks did not have the audio and video synched. The second copy of the DVD also was not in synch on the first 4 tracks. Since all of my other DVD's play perfectly, it seems unlikely that my DVD player is the source of the problem. I can forgive the bonus tracks being poorly transferred, but I can't forgive the second-rate, bush-league, synching on the first 4 tracks of the movie. What a let down. Didn't anybody else have this problem????"
19127,0,Good for cables. Not much else...,"A lot of people recommend this for PCB work. I have found that it scratches PCB's, and doesn't hold them up very well. I use some small spring clamps clipped into to the clips it comes with, it keeps them from scratching whatever I'm working on. If you are going to be doing PCB, you should probably get a Panavise Jr. This product is really good for making cables though. It's good for clipping a connector into one end, and the wire into the other. The magnifying glass is difficult to use while soldering, but it might be better for other uses. You also can't get it far enough away to really see anything."
19130,0,Just skip over the personal stuff - it's a good read,"I found this book interesting, especially the set ups (help from Hollywood, lots of practice runs in Georgetown, etc) needed to attempt to exfiltrate an agent. I just skipped over the parts about their personal relationship (it really didn't belong in the book). It was also chilling and upsetting to read about the people directly affected by Aldrich Ames and Robert Hannsen."
19133,0,Machine Vision,"This book has a thorough discussion of the topics of computer vision. It starts with the basic elements of computer images and eventually explains stereo images and 3-dimensionality.I would not suggest this book for someone who wants samples of code, because this book does not have any. This book is designed for people interested in the theory of computer vision and can take that theory and apply it themselves. A strong background in math is needed for this book."
19135,0,Funny Movie...better if you know the history,"To the unfamiliar viewer there is enough to laugh about without any understanding of Vietnam or Watergate. To that end, this movie succeeds as a teen comedy with some cute and talented female leads.However, if you are familiar with ""All the President's Men"" or with ""Nixon"" (Oliver Stone's Conspiradrama), then you will laugh deeply at the parody and the silliness. The Nixon character and the seventies humor are right on target and very, very funny."
19150,0,decent read,"I got this book hoping it would be a romp through the carnival world at/around the turn of the century. There is some great stuff in the book about Mabel and her tiger training, but I was hoping for more from the rest of the carnival. 3/5 of the book is quality, but the rest is a little long in the tooth. I had fun reading the book but I was glad when it was over."
19151,0,love element took away from Gere's performance!,"Gere is great at portraying the extremes of bi-polar disorder, but the film is lacking in two major areas. One is the boring doctor/patient relationship and the other is the fact that bi-polar patients also exhibit weeks, months, and even years of ""normal"" behavior. I wish the film dealt more with the difficulties of having relationships with family, friends, and lovers. Bi-polar disorder is a serious one and medication is a must in order to balance yourself. The movie should have shown some of the struggles of finding the right medication for it."
19157,0,Better Than Hitchcock,"I found the ending to this film to be disappointing, I might even say lame or contrived, and that ruined my enjoyment of most of the movie. I strongly recommend the 1978 remake with William Powell, John Mills, and David Warner. This is one of those rare times when a remake was better than the original, and that's even rarer when the original was a Hitchcock film. The climax in this one is action-filled, and will appeal to any fan of mystery/suspense/action classics. I give the '78 remake 5 stars. I've been unable to find the 1978 version here in the US, maybe because it was a British production, but I just visited Amazon in the UK, and it is available there. Just remember , if you're buying a foreign DVD, verify that it will play in Region 1 (US & Canada)."
19161,0,"Disappointing, compared to Theatre of the Imagination","LOVE the book, Women Who Run with the Wolves, and have listened to some of the tapes of that book on Clarissa Pinkola Estes' tapes, ""Theatre of the Imagination"". I was hoping to get the CD or tape version of Theatre of the Imagination, Vol. I,but it doesn't appear to be available through Amazon, so thought I'd try this.This was published 3 years before the book, Women Who Run with the Wolves, and it is certainly less polished than ""Theatre of the Imagination"". She just seemed to wander a bit.I wouldn't recommend it to people who love the book, but my friend loved it!"
19164,0,Overpriced for the size,"I, admittedly, did not read the dimensions before buying this - so I warn you, this is very small. It is the size of a piece of printer paper. I love the artwork, but I just wish it was bigger or cheaper."
19170,0,Its an ok action figure,"Ever since the Marvel Legends lineup was signed over to Hasbro, things have gone downhill for the once prestigious action figures. This Thor figure comes with his trademark M'jornill hammer and the executioner's battle axe. He is from the storyline ""Thor Lord Of Earth"" I pressume and it looks ok compare to the other Thos figures but not the best one yet! However I don't recommend anyone to go and buy from these sellers/scalpers on here that want $29.99 for it thats exageratted considering that it just came out and its selling for $9.95 and Walmart or Target. Say no to SCALPERS who buy everything of the shelves and jack the price up online to make a living out of it!"
19172,0,not gourmet,more flavor than peanut butter-pieces of fruits and nuts-expensive-ok but certainly not gourmet-not bad forbreakfast or lunch-pretty filling-did not try other flavors
19173,0,"Dry, Stale, High Calorie","I found these to be dry & stale. Also, relatively high in calories/points for me (I'm a lifetime weight watcher) and I'm not sure the trade-off for convenience and nutrition is worth. Frankly, I think I'm better off with microwaving a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast for taste/filling/cost.Won't be buying these again."
19175,0,Deadfall,Nicholas Cage was very annoying so I guess he played his role well. Hard to follow at times. Definitely not one of my favorites.
19179,0,"Not bad, but not as good as the first.","I am sad to say that this album was a tad flat in comparison with the first Before You Were Punk. This hurts to say because I am a fan of many bands that appear on this album. The problem is that they don't convince me that these songs were done due a personal mission to revive them. It feels more like they were offered a few dollars to record a song and then go back to the bar. Yes folks, I am saying that this album lacks passion. If you like the eighties and new punk I would advise one to pick up the first release. You will have more memories haunting you and your mind will ache from singing them over and over in your head."
19183,0,Great music -- less than ideal packaging,"Great music -- worth four stars. Not my favorite Tomita, but still very good. Why 3 stars, then? No fault of the producers, but I wish there were a US release of this album, like so many other Tomita. Most of the liner notes here are in Japanese (of course), and what little English text there is is in micro-font. A great listen -- but I'll buy it again someday if/when it is released in America."
19192,0,"It is just OK, nothing special.","I found the chapters scattered and storyline pretty uneventful. The book was not a quick read. Pretty forgetable overall. Funny moments, some chapters were more entertaining than others, but def was not a page turner."
19199,0,not as good as other brands,"I have used other brands from [...] and had so much better results. This brand did not even catch a moth for over a week! In fact I have seen a few flying around but not going near the trap. With other traps I have bought in the past, mouths were in it within a few hours. I am thinking the hormone is not strong enough or I was sold an older shelf product."
19201,0,Entertaining video of an enviable voyage,"A 5-year sailing trip around the world is something many of us dream about. This family pulled it off. The ports of call were interesting as was the commentary. The film is done in the style of ""The Endless Summer"" with narration over a silent film with background music. The one things I thought was missing though was shots of them actually sailing. A 5 year voyage on the high seas and most the shots were of the ports of call. There wasn't a lot of video of the boat sailing at sea and based on the footage they didn't experience any hardships, broken rudders, torn sails or anything else that I am sure added some real drama to the voyage. While overall it is a nice video of a family vacation and it is well shot, I found it to be more a film of destinations rather than sailing."
19205,0,school of flesh,"I enjoyed this film! An older woman falls for the passionate eyes of a young bartender. She becomes a prisoner of her desires for his love. The aloof, yet caring and secretive persona of the young gentleman only adds to the anquish she experiences as love emotionally tears at their identities. The plot has interesting twists and turns. A good departure from hollywood."
19207,0,"great story, awful sound quality","The story is lovely, but the sound quality on this video is atrocious. Three adults and a child all watched it at two different homes (different equipment) and all agreed: what's wrong with the SOUND? Be prepared to narrate what's happening FOR your child, who won't hear it all. It's a calm, relaxing video using stills of the book's illustrations and Grant's voice-over narration that you can't understand. If you're WILLING to narrate it youself, it has a good message about cooperation and living with love."
19210,0,New versus recycled,"A print cartridge is a print cartridge, and it is not clear to me why I continue to buy some of them brand-new, as opposed to the considerably cheaper recycled ones. So far, I have had no problems with any of the recycled cartridges that I have bought."
19212,0,Sky's the limit... well so is this DVD,"OK, we all love the video's that Van Halen has pumped out thru the years and yes I did purchase this DVD, but this is missing some key elements. Did you know Ive seen videos/live clips for ""Hear about it Later"", ""Unchained"", ""If this is Love"", ""Runnin With the Devil"" ""Eruption/You Really Got Me"", ""Jaimies Cryin"", ""Pretty Woman"", ""Im the One"" and others just from MTV alone. I'm confused with the Van Halen archives. It seems that Warner Bro's is waiting until were all deceised until they release a good DLR erra DVD compilation or live show. Believe me, the bootlegged ""Us Festival"" I have is good, but I'm tired of dealing with dealers online and at record swaps for a taste of something that should be legally released from the industry pigs. Is there an answer in sight?"
19217,0,From the Dead of Night,"This was not at all what I expected. It does deal with death and spirits, but it isn't quite as dark as the cover art might lead you to believe. This would be one of those back-from-the-dead movies that I would let my sheltered 10-year old watch. Anyway, it is not one of Lindsay Wagner's best movies, but she still gave a believable performance. I have often considered her to be a better actress than the roles she chose. In other words, I wish she would have done more movies like SCRUPLES and MEG LAUREL and less of this second-rate stuff. So, on a scale of 1-10, I give the movie about a 6, but I give Ms. Wagner a slightly lower than usual 9."
19220,0,Very mellow...,"I bought this after all I heard about UFO and definately wasn't disapointed. UFO has a sound that is pretty unplaceable although I would say if you are into this then listen to Manu Chau, some of the less weird stuff by Sukia ('Dream machine' being quite close), Coldcut, and The Herbaliser. I especially reccomend the last two. UFO's album, while at times a tad mediocre, is uplifting and cool all the way through. Stand out tracks are 'United Future Airlines' and 'Doopsyllolic' which is veeery funky. They are a group to watch out for, they are destined for big things. However, if you are new to UFO then I would reccomend their eponymous debut album, very funky with fantastic samples."
19227,0,This book explains a lot.,"I read recently about a Houston high school student with a B average who, enrolling at the University of Houston, could not make it through her freshman year because the courses were too difficult. She dropped out and entered a trade school.I also read recently that the two states in the country that have the lowest requirement for proficiency on state tests are Colorado and Texas. To be considered proficient in those states a student need only achieve a reading score in the 13th percentile. That's the bottom thirteen percent.I don't know what happened in Colorado, but I have a pretty good idea about Texas. The state tests in Texas were first administered to Governor Bush and continually dumbed down until the test writers came up with a version the guv was able to pass. That's the one that's used to test Texas students."
19229,0,The Who,"I love The Who(minus the early/mod days and the Rock Opera) Legendary Guitarist and Singer and Drummer,Drummer had so much potential.My compliant being a little too long at times and too much romanticism,but it has this great sadness and yet they made it through thick and thin. Phenomenal Story and Good Tribute."
19243,0,"Great wrench, rubbish ratchet.","The ratchet provided in this set is rubbish, the gear pawl sheared the first time it was used, however the actual straight wrenches are excellent quality."
19259,0,Better than I expected,"I held out for a very long time before watching this film for the first time. With all the hype that comes with this film, as well as many other ""classic"" films, such as ""Citizen Kane"", I was expecting a big let down. I'm from the younger generation, and a lot of these old movies made in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, just don't appeal to me most of the time. But I must say that this film wasn't that bad. The plot stayed interesting and the ending had a good twist as well. However, I don't think that this movie should be recognized as being one of the best films of all-time."
19263,0,dissapointed,Why is this DVD not in anamorphic format? Was the original 4:3? Its depressing to watch such an excellent movie distorted on a 16:9 screen. WB blew it. This applies to the other WB classics as well.
19265,0,Casablanca used,I watched this show with expectancy having heard about it all my life. The sound quality is clear but inaudible. Had to listen keenly to hear what they were saying. I enjoyed it and am now in love with Humphrey myself. Don't know that I would watch it again but I certainly appreciate the fundations set by this movie which is indeed a classic.
19266,0,Not that special.,"Casablanca is a good film but not a masterpiece. The story is bit boring but the love triangle is the best part of the film. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman had incredible chemistry together, they are magic on-screen. This little black & white film noir is a classic but expext some flaws. Take it or leave it."
19267,0,Good but definitely not the best,"I was very excited when i first watched this movie because it is almost on top of lists of all-time greatest movies and the reviews are like wow.. this must be really one of the best! After watching it, I was kinda disappointed because I think the story is so-so, there is no chemistry between the two lead cast (but Bergman is very lovely though). I don't know what's so special about this movie. Did I miss it or what?"
19270,0,Bells were silly,"The dvds in the collection were excellent, but the remaining box space included tiny bells with place cards which were useless."
19271,0,Definately not all it's cracked up to be,"Now that my synopsis line has made everyone mad, let's be open minded. This is a good film. Definately one of the best that the first half of this century has to offer. But really, a ""perfect film"" as it has been called so often? What about the poorly timed and ineffectively executed fist slamming scene Bogart has during his late night drinking binge? There are hundreds of problems like that with this film; little things and big things that permeate this film. Again, I thought it was good, but I can count dozens of movies off the top of my head that I enjoyed a LOT more. The dialogue is good, the acting is good, the visuals are good, the movie is good.The DVD is worth having. It's clean, it's pretty, and it has some neat stuff on it. But please, can we get off the ""perfect film"" thing?"
19280,0,Good,"This is a decent thriller that I saw in really limited release in the theaters, after which--in only about a week--it was pulled. That it's about a real terrorist hightens the experience of viewing the film. It's a bit contrived in spots, and the narrative is out of balance. It's a bit of a B movie through much of it, but a decent B movie that perhaps didn't deserve to be so overlooked."
19281,0,Copper Nonstick skillet,This product preforms very well. It fit most grills and the removable handle is great. Food cooks evenly and well. It is hard to clean up if you don't use the right spray or oil. It also discolors very easily.
19286,0,Sweet Revenge - Fern Michaels wrote this one in sleep,"This book is not as good, not near as riveting or interesting as the others. Looks like it was rushed out, along with the next one too. If'd I'd read this first, I would not have bought any of the others in the series. Come on Fern Michaels, and write like you're paid to write! Are you using a ghost writer, or drinking while you're writing? Boring and doesn't wrap up to grab you for the next one or anything else."
19291,0,hard to conquer,"I bought this for my daughter for her 8th birthday. Perhaps that is too young because she cannot get it. My older girls tried it to no avail. I tried it, and I consider myself a very coordinated person. I cannot do it. My sister, also a mom, also very coordinated, could not do it. I see people riding these things all over town, so I know it can be done. I am in awe, and try to study their movements as I see them. It feels impossible to me. So, it has been sitting in the garage for almost 4 months, winter is coming on, I don't know if it'll ever happen. I keep thinking I'm going to take it down to 'skateboard corner' and have the local 'rif raf' teach me. But how would that look? Like I'm flirting with the local 'rif raf' that's how. Nope, we'll just have to bring it out next spring and try again."
19295,0,"easy read, but misleading in parts","The book does attack many of the current ethical problems, but while it tries to present several sides, it consistently comes down on the politically liberal side while giving short shrift to competing views.For example, he does tip his hat to John Locke and John Stuart Mill, but does not give a thoughtful hearing to the idea of property rights and how the concept of just ownership can be used to attack environmental problems.He is in awe of the Marxist platitudes of economic equality."
19297,0,"only teaches ""bunny ears"" method","My son already knew how to do bunny ears - I thought this would teach him the other way. The problem with the bunny ears method is that kids don't get the shoes tight enough. So this was good in that it gave him the confidence to tie his own shoes, however he still needs a lot of help to get them tight. The kids have since knotted the laces up completely."
19303,0,Real cost is in the filters,"This device works well, but the filters need to be replaced often because they have shallow pleats and no prefilter. If you can find an air purifier with a washable filter, buy it. The replacements filters for this one can run up to $20 apiece. They probably cost the company $0.25 each to manufacture and ship. And good luck getting a replacement filter from the hardware store- I've looked, and while they have about 100 types of 3M filters, none of the local or chain stores I visited had them.I bought this device new from Woot.com two years ago for $20, and at the time there was a $20 rebate. I can't believe the same machine costs more than $100 here. It's a fan enclosed by plastic.3M - why are you so greedy?"
19305,0,Spelling mistakes!,"Great book, I would recommend the story to anyone, but this Kindle version is absolutely riddled with spelling issues and repeated lines of text. I can't rate the product any higher because of this. I haven't had any trouble with my Kindle and I absolutely love it, but this issue was extremely disappointing. You might want to think about redoing this book."
19319,0,not for young kids,"This is a decent documentary on an Amazonian rain forest. It shows lots of wildlife and has some interesting footage, particularly of the Harpie Eagle. There is also fairly good footage of sloths, spider monkeys, peccaries, jaguars, howler monkeys, parrots, a taper, and some rodents that aren't in N. America. However, note that part of the theme is predators and prey. There are lots of shots of things getting eaten or dying. In particular, the shots of baby monkeys getting eaten were hard for my 5 year old to take (the 9 yr old was fine however)."
19320,0,Satan Claus is out there and we need more boy scouts,"This movie is a cross between Die Hard and Willis' David Addison of Moonlighting fame: violent, wise-cracking, slapstick and football - what more could a guy want. It is, however, over the top with more cursing than necessary, but believe it or not the chemistry works between Willis and Wayans. I was hoping it might spawn a sequel or two given that Willis at the end of the film asks Wayans to join him as a partner in his detective business. Perhaps the box office take just wasn't there. Lots of comedians in this film. Wayans comical, but in a more serious role, Rick Ducommon as the guy with the car in his pool and Taylor Negron steals this movie as the oh so seriously deadly Milo. Chelsea Field hasn't much of a part, but this movie does seem to have a low opinion of women. Also, despite her unnecessarily foul mouth Danielle Harris as Darian is charming despite that preoccupation. If you blink or go to the fridge you'll miss Halle Berry."
19326,0,Good lens for the price,Good Lens for the price.I;m still to explore all the features.Zoom range is good. IS helps at larger zooms range.
19329,0,Avoiding consistency,"Although Beck continued to streamline his diversely equal appreciation for rap, electronic, rock, folk, funk, and soul into digestible and recognizable concoctions, too much reused Information causes the disc to loose momentum about two-thirds through."
19332,0,New Hampshire napping,Tasty textures emitted with effortless ease cannot amend dull pacing and pseudo-cultural phrasing.
19335,0,"Full of disparate situations, but an ok film","This movie is ok. Sofia Vergara, Jaci Velazquez and Roselyn Sanchez do a pretty good job in the performances as 3 women that realize they are all dating the same guy, Eduardo Verastegui (who knew absolutely no English before this movie started). The movie is full of inside jokes (Roselyn Sanchez' character being confused as a beauty queen when in real likfe Sanchez was a Miss Puerto Rico Petite) and spanglish worlds. The humor, very much like Hispanic sitcomes, is full of ridiculous and disparate situations. I kinda liked the movie, especially cause Eduardo Verastegui was in it."
19338,0,Cute,"Cute movie the first time you watch it. But after one or two sittings, you'll get bored of this one. It's too sad, actually - but what can you do? Not all movies can keep you glued to the telly no matter how many times you've seen it before."
19341,0,not for me,"I can't really rate this, I got for my brother, don't know if he used it yet to make his deer sausage this year."
19342,0,a novel (pun intended) premise,"its a novel (pun intended) premise, but I didn't really like the vision of the future Anderson came up with. A shame that a vision of virtual immortality is so morally bankrupt. I did like the character that was loyal to his wife's memory. His marital fidelity was a bright counterpoint to the emptiness of Anderson's imagined easy going, free sex future. Would have been better if he had not said that he was ok with everyone else's immorality."
19346,0,okay.,"This album is awlright. It's for true Drainheads only. It isn't as good as horror wrestling, but then again it's a little different. It seems to me that these stunningly hot swedish girls(with the exception of the guitarist, who is from paraguay or uruguay or something) have calmed down quite a bit. At times, the songs tend to get monotonous, but there are some industrial elements thrown in as well, giving a listener a new sound with each song. The cover is worth the cost of the cd."
19348,0,child development book by Santock,"I needed this for my psychology class and the price was fair. I was disappointed though, b/c in the description it said no highlighting and there was moderate highlighting in the book. The main reason I had bought this particular one was b/c the seller had said in the description ""no highlighting""."
19349,0,Pretty good,"I like this book, I like how it flows and I think the ideas presented are good. It should be helpful for a lot of people. But, sometimes things don't work out for abuse victims. There should be another chapter in this book that gives some idea on what victims should do if nothing seems to work. Sort of like an ""in case of emergency break this glass"" kind of chapter. It could present some ideas on how to give up the losing battle, get on with your life, and try not to get too depressed."
19362,0,Vividly Depicted Characters,"This book has created intriguing characters. But the main characters like Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett are admired and glorified to a fault. Scarlett O'Hara is tough, practical and no-nonsense. But in essence, she's a villain with these qualities. She steals her own sister's boyfriend, emotionally abuses her children, marries men for money and spite, and cheats on everyone and anyone. Seems there's nothing she would not do for money and for herself. Surely she has certain qualities that are needed in a war to survive, but it's not the war that made her selfish to the core. It simply brings out her selfishness on a larger scale."
19366,0,Not bad.,"Not a bad novel for a first writer. It could almost be a classic except for a few points - a) it's unecessarily long and could have used more editing; b) the second half is weak and not very interesting; c) it's description of Reconstruction is very one-sided and half-correct and d)it's too racist. Other than that, it's not bad."
19372,0,this is a good book,I think that Gone with the wind is the best book ever written the movie is a winner to . I love how it informs you of everything that is going on. You go through the whole book like will Scarlett and Redett get together or will they stay together will Scarlett finally get Ashely. Will they survive the war. Who will live and who will die. You read through the tragides and the good times . I give Gone with the Wind and will argue with anyone who differs.
19373,0,all the racist babble just goes on and on ad nauseum...,"It's an ok story until after the war and then how they turn on the poor old masters and blah, blah, blah... pure southern womanhood all a-fearin' them free black men going around crazy raping... oh come on Margaret, where did you do your research?Just too much of it... and I'm not really so sure Scarlet is so bad, she seems the only one capable of doing the work it takes to get the whole family out of all the scrapes they are in... so what's wrong with that???Well, must consider when it was written I suppose... next I'm reading ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" to get the bad taste out of my mouth."
19374,0,Not as enjoyable as the movie,"but it works, mainly because of Scarlett and Ashley, who are engaging if limited characters. Rhett Butler begins as interesting but is ultimately tiresome. Mammy is engaging, Prissy less so. The less said about Melanie and Ellen the better. Don't count on it as history lesson, either. Really, it's not much more than a well written bodice ripper (which explains why it has so many adolescent fans) but bodice rippers are often fun."
19378,0,"An okay tape, but could be better.","RHYTHM AND WEEP is the funniest short here. I think it has some funny scenes, especially when the Stooges are about to jump off the building. Too many dancing scenes though. BACK FROM THE FRONT was okay, but not great. Moe does his Hitler impression also done in all three shorts on the THEY STOOGE TO CONGA tape. Good toward the end. THE THREE TROUBLEDOERS was just too boring. There are a few funny scenes, but not enough. I don't usually like westerns.An okay tape, but nothing special."
19382,0,"Not as good as the ""Bad Boys"" series","I agree with the only other reviewer at this time, that most of the stories fall far short of typical good, steamy anthologies.Only the story of the ER doc and the Lifeguard was good, but I think it works only well as a short story.All in all I would reccomend the first 3 ""Bad Boys""eries instead or ""All Through The Night"" which has the first of 3 stories by Lori Foster (the second two are played out in ""I Love Bad Boys"" and ""I Brake for Bad Boys"")"
19383,0,Do Not Buy! Unless you have the DX,"Let me be clear, this manga, along with all other graphic novels is useless on the regular 6"" kindle! Books in comic format cannot have text enlarged, to make matters worse, the way each page displays, it leaves an inch of blank border around each page to accomodate the page counter. This is a great book, but be sure to buy it in paperback format. I don't have a DX, but I would imagine that having one would make this book a lot easier to read."
19389,0,Poor quality video,"Before putting this video on sale some enhancement should have been done to the original film. It is good only for its historic value, but the quality of the film is extremely poor."
19397,0,Seven Samurai,"I have mixed feelings about Seven Samurai, why? Probably due to the length of the film,Yes it looks beautiful,the settings,the black and white,but nearing 3 hours?Maybe I can't appreciate a Non-American(Or Foreign to me) Film,It has good acting and fight scenes,but I actually liked 13 assassins(a Much later and contemporary film that of course for artistic measure can't compare and it is even more brutally violent.)Somehow will fawn over the ""artistic"" values,I would have too,albeit if it was under the nearly 3hours,and not as slow paced."
19400,0,disappointed,"I had seen an earlier translation of the SEVEN SAMARI which was, I thought, truer to the japanese. Things like ""fencing"" which is a foreign concept and ""brats"" instead of ""pisspants"". The translation seemed to dumb down the dialogue."
19409,0,The last Trail,Not what I had hoped for but may be great for others . too old timey for me may be a good read for someone.
19418,0,Fairly interesting.,"This book is relatively interesting, though it is a bit dry in places. Worth a read for people who are tea-lovers and those interested in the tea ceremony."
19426,0,Sizing is way off,"Mrs. Davis ~ I ordered this for a new dress that I purchased. I made sure to look at the sizing chart and measure my bust appropriately. I am by no means over weight but am curvy. My size would have been a 34 but to be on the safe side I ordered a 38 expecting to hem a few seems to take it in. That is not the case. This is very, very snug on me. I am not sure if the sizing chart provided online is incorrect (I checked both Amazon and Vanity Fair's site) or if their sizing is just off. I am hoping to just make this item work but am disappointed."
19429,0,Less than pristine,"New book arrived with markedly creased front cover. Less than perfect. When advertized as brand new, I am one to expect that the item will really appear as brand new. My ""new"" book did not."
19430,0,"Heavy, but satisfying","This book is definitely not short on Biblical themes and references, but as someone who is - at best - agnostic, I wasn't put off at all by this. East of Eden is an obvious Steinbeck work, in that it does have a lot of the darker side of human-kind along with the turn-of-the-century California setting. The grandiose tale spans two families and three generations, with apt ties between all. It is a story of morality and brings up some questions about the soul and inner workings of us all. To me, it ultimately boils down to a story of hope, highlighted by the repeated mention of a single word, timshel, which equates to ""thou mayest."" It is this theme of choosing and controlling your own destiny that most captivated me, as well as the thoughts on acceptance and forgiveness."
19432,0,Grammer/Spelling? Am I the only one who noticed??,"I am only 1/4 through the book and have already noticed a very obvious misspelling and periods where there should be commas, etc. I think the editor should've done a little more homework. I know it shouldn't bother me, but it does. Call me crazy......"
19437,0,Why Hate Steinbeck?,"I thought the review below by bluejaye99 to be particularly interesting. I dont think Steinbeck is in the absolute top rank (with, say James or Faulkner or Twain) but he is a fine story teller who uses words much more fluidly than most American writers. Yes, this book has its clumsy parts, but it is easy to read and makes an impressive beach book."
19442,0,the orignal and best,i really think this is a great movie. it set he slasher genre some friday the 13th fans try to say that jason was better but really he just a copy of michel. this flim devilers scare and gives you a creepy feeling long after wards. i relly like the haunt shot at the benging of six year old micheal holding the knife with that look on his face.
19447,0,Halloween Is Awesome! But what's with the Stupid Widescreen?,"Halloween is an awesome movie. But one thing I find really stupid is the widescreen (2.35:1 ratio) meaning if you dont have a widescreen tv, the picture will come up with humongous black bars along the top and bottom of the screen, making it halfscreen. I would rather see the whole picture instead of half!"
19452,0,"DISAPPOINTING, but still entertaining","Well, I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for this, but I just don't see what all the hype is about concerning Halloween. Yes, it is well crafted, and yes, for it's time it was scary. But it is also EXTREMELY slow and plodding, with countless shots of Mike just shambling around, stalking Jaime. Get to the point! It seems as if John Carpenter wanted to go for an atmosphere of dread and horror, but I believe that other movies (which were made either during or before that time) were better at it, like Suspiria and Night of the Living Dead. The film is too routinely paced and routinely directed to stand out in the viewer's mind, and really is nowhere as scary as its reputed to be. Give it a shot, but just don't be surprised if you aren't as blown away (or scared) as everyone said you would be."
19455,0,Disappointed,"I like the Halloween story line. Jamie Lee Curtis is good. However, I was disappointed that it shows nudity. One of the girls boobs are showing several times. Why Hollywood thinks they have to put nudity in all the time is beyond me. I think it ruins the film. Otherwise, it's a great horror flick. Love the theme song. It is so fitting."
19459,0,Slasher.,"This is probably the prototype slasher movie. It's slow moving, but somewhat atmospheric. It's a movie one should have seen, but it's not quite as good as it's reputation."
19470,0,"Interesting Idea,","I saw the movie for the first time 8 or 9 years ago, it caught my eye as I am a huge Crichton fan, and I was born in the same town as Albert Finney. sure, it is low budget hokum, but in all honesty it did raise the idea of digital image manipulation and subliminal advertising long before the ""RATS"" episode in the past election. I thought that given the constraints of the budget and of Crichtons very limited directing talent (as anyone who has ever played spot the boom mike in Coma will attest)The movie was really not that awful, and the power pop theme music is worth a couple of stars alone."
19474,0,Why rewrite Trinity?,"Leon Uris is one of my favourite authors, but Redemption was comparatively disappointing to Trinity. It was unfortunate to revisit much of Trinity's story in Redemption, and in a more poorly written style that seemed to exist only to avoid exact repetition than anything else. It did improve somewhat in the second half, but it was somehow spoiled for me. I felt patronized in that I, as a reader, could not be trusted to read Trinity first, or take the ""Redemption"" portion of Redemption as a novel unto itself. Do read Trinity. Then read the second half of Redemption. I've not given up on Leon Uris by a long shot, though. He truly is a fabulous and captivating author. More often than not, at any rate."
19477,0,Precision 6 Piece Cleaning Kit,This kit is a little bulky and stays at home when the cameras go out. I like the air blower to clean out the cracks and crevices of the housing. The brush is not protected so I don't see it lasting very long. I'll give it to my wife for her makeup brush shortly.(that's what it seems like)
19479,0,Silly but entertaining!!!!!!!!!,"You have to watch this movie for what it is....the punchlines are silly and the acting is over done, but it is entertainingin it's own way. The scenery is worth watching the movie and thedogs are wonderful!!!!!Don't take life too serious and certainly don't judge this movietoo serious!!!!"
19481,0,It's just ok..,This is the second notebook pad I've purchased. The first one did not raise the notebook up at all so there was no airflow. This one is designed to allow airflow underneath the laptop. The fans on this model are not very powerful and you can barely feel the air moving. It keeps my Macbook Pro 2.14Ghz around 84 degrees. The previous pad I had stayed around 80 degrees.
19482,0,Cheap piece of junk,"Not Sure what the other reviewers are talking about. The product works & does cool. It is so quiet I kept checking to make sure it was working. But it's very small. I got a 14 inch laptop & it's a tiny bit too small. I would not recomend it for a 16 inch. I used it about 5 or 6 times maybe less than 10 hrs. before it just stopped working, It is very cheaply made & wieghs about a 2 pounds or less. Please do not buy from sellers who are charging $60 for it. I paid $30 down at wal-mart for mine & feel ""taken"" after looking at better deals on Amazon (this thing really is cheap & flimsy)."
19487,0,cord needs improvement,"Works great, but the cord started malfunctioning within weeks of purchase. I resorted to blindly pushing and pulling the cord in different directions, and twisting the on/off switch. Eventually, even that stopped working.Luckily, it's not a tough fix if you're experienced in soldering (thanks to my brother), so the cord now works like new. However, I assume most people wouldn't be able to fix it, and the pad is pretty much useless without it, so that's a huge problem. My brother suggested superglue-ing the edges of the on/off switch to prevent the cord from slipping/getting pulled out of place. Perhaps if you do that when you first get it, you won't have a problem with the cord malfunctioning."
19488,0,Better and Cheaper out there,"This is great if you have a small-sized laptop, but the dimensions are rather small. It would not fit my Compaq Presario 2800 (too small). Also there are other Notebook coolers that have more than 2 fans (I have found up to 4 fans). Though these other coolers are thicker, they seem to cool down the laptop much better and are significantly cheaper. Cheers."
19489,0,Cheap price,"Get what you pay for. They become noisy every couple of years, but fit my notebook stand perfectly. Bought two."
19490,0,Its OK but...,"I bought this product 1 year ago. It works great for 1 month, after that the fans stop working. The solution was simple, cut off the switch (its not necessary) if you plug it into a UBS port, its bucause you need to fan you computer.After this simple operation, its working again. I think it worth the money that you pay!"
19491,0,It's OK...,"This DOES make a difference, but I found myself wishing that it worked better than it does. On the positive side, it is lightweight, (although I see what some reviewers mean by the cheap feel), and the fans are relatively quiet. However, it doesn't move nearly as much air as I wish it did, (which is probably the tradeoff for the quiet fans!) When all is said and done, while it helps, my laptop still runs pretty hot when using taxing applications. Just a so-so product for me."
19492,0,"worked great at first, but burnt out quickly",I bought this product about 6 months ago and I was very happy with it until recently when it decided to just stop working. I personally don't like buying things that I'm just going to have to replace again in a few months so I would recommend going with another brand.
19507,0,too loud,"when i first got this cooler, it worked fine, except that it was really loud. it was really noticeable from when it was turned on and off. it did cool my laptop though so i was ok with it. after a year, the plug doesnt work anymore, i have to jiggle it into place and make sure it stays a certain way or else it will come out. im considering buying a brand thats surface is metal so it stays cool naturally. i dont understand why these coolers only have 2 fans that are directed toward the middle when the fans on a laptop are located on various areas of the laptop. also, the cooler has small vents on the side which i think is stupid because they barely release any air. i suppose after one year i should let the cooler retire, but i couldve found a similar priced, quieter cooler that also has a longer life."
19508,0,just OK,the chill pad was thicker and louder than i expected. i also did not notice any heat difference in my laptop. ive seen better products out there for around the same price. i ended up returning mine.
19512,0,Blows down,"In addition to this item, I also own the ""Laptop Notebook Cooler Pad w/ 3 Fans"" that's about the same price as this, and the ""Antec USB-Powered Notebook Cooler"" that's currently about triple the price. I place them under stereo equipment that has problems with overheating. Unlike the other two units, this pad sucks air from the top of the unit and then blows it out the back. This is less effective than blowing up and through my units, and they are noticeably hotter with this unit than with either of the others. However, if your laptop fan blows down this unit might work for you by pulling away the air the fan is blowing out."
19513,0,"Too small for 17"" notebook !!!","I bought this along with case and returned next day, because base is too small and can't work right with notebook I have."
19514,0,Okay for awhile,I've gone through 2 of these with a Dell notebook. It is definitly not a long-term solution to an overheating problem or a preventative measure. I would recommend only using it if you are just trying to get your notebook to last a few months longer until you can replace it.
19522,0,Jabra FreeSpeak Headset,"Jarba FreeSpeak is a great headset for 2 1/2 years, after that the battery dies.This is where the bad part comes in. YOU CAN NOT REPLACE THE BATTERY!So, keep this in mind when buying one. I found out the hard way."
19524,0,"Very Reliable, with drawbacks","I owned the 250v for 3 years! and if the piece that held the eargel on hadn't broken I wouldn't be in the market for a new one. This unit is great, with some inconvenient drawbacks. First, turning this thing on and off is supposed to be a matter of holding the multi-function button for 5-10 sec. Good luck with that one....I never turned it off because I couldn't. Also there is a tiny blue strobe on this thing that let's you know its on. Yeah not a great feature when its stays lit constantly while it charges on my night stand. I can't speak for its standby or talk time because I charged it nightly and had a car charger for long trips, but I never ran out of juice either. Would I buy it again?....Yep, its too comfortable to pass up."
19526,0,Doesn't fit securely,"I like the operation, but not the fit. The eargel falls below my ear canal, and therefore falls off too easily - it would be better if it were adjustable to different size ears."
19530,0,Quality Isn't The Best!,"Although the packaging was fine, and the product arrived on time, I was very disappointed with the quality of the series. Some parts of the disks seemed lots darker than others. However, I'm satisfied with the price, and will keep the product. John S."

19548,0,"Okay, I like this one, so sue me...","i watched it recently on video just to see what the fuss is about to see if it was really that bad...of course, some scenes in the movie are very rank, liz berkeley making a man climax by giving him a lap dance is the ultimate in raunch, but it definately is a turn on ! She definately leaves her ""save by the bell persona"" behind. maybe she just wanted to try something different. the other women in the film are gorgeous too. and you get a good feel for what the life of a showgirl is about...degrading? maybe. but these women knew what they were getting into when they got into this business...this film shows you the sleaziness of the entertainment business in contrast to the women who will stop at nothing to make their dream real... Gina Gershon( america's favorite 'almost lesbian' ) has a nice role here as a cutthroat. this is simply a guilty pleasure movie; enjoy it for what it is: a nice display of t and a"
19550,0,Not the worst movie in the world,"After getting this movie more or less accidentally, I decided I mind as well watch it.. see what the hype (or lack thereof) is about.Overall, this movie isn't that great. The acting is actually quite average.. nothing special, but certainly not horrible.. this was probably the thing that surprised me most... I was expecting acting on par with a (bad) porno.Somehow, they managed to make the nudity (and there's a good bit of it in the movie) completely nonsexual .. even the scenes where there's actual sex going on. How they did this, I have no idea.I could concievably imagine a story similar to this happening in the real world, which is the other thing about the movie thatsurprised me. I expected it to have the believeability of a badly written 1950's science fiction movie. So, this was a nice surprise.If they'd used decent actors, and even if everything else had stayed the same, they may've actually had a good movie to show for it."
19552,0,"Mediocre story, beautiful women","To me, this basically seemed like a film contrived to showcase a nude Elizabeth Berkley to sell tickets and DVDs. I guess it worked with me, as I could not resist seeing the class president from Saved By The Bell in her birthday suit. There was some plot beyond that, but I think that, for men at least, the only real memories of this will be the showgirls. To be fair, that is the title of it, and that is what it is about."
19559,0,"underrated film is not that bad, actually, its almost good","what do people find about this movie that is so bad. I liked it. it's not the best movie ever made, but it is fun to watch and the performances are not that bad. The only reason thsi movie got three stars insted of four, actually, i give it three and a half, was because of the truly lousy ending. That was the only flaw in an otherwise good, visually dazzling film. I liked it."
19563,0,Russian Grammar,"This book is definitly not for beginners. I'm sure in time I will be able to use it and it seems to be very comprehensive, but not a good book to start with when there is still the need to learn the basics like reading cyrillic and being able to pronounce the words correctly. Should not be listed as a beginner book at all especially with the cost of it, a hard way to learn that I can't use this book for quite a while."
19575,0,John Dewey's Cafe?,"It's hard not to admire the enthusiasm of Christopher Phillips in his efforts to revive interest in philosophy among a wide variety of contemporary persons. Questions arise, however, as to just how socratic his modus operandi is. He declares he's no self-help guru, for instance. Yet is his readiness to descend to tears and therapy rather than ironic tough-mindedness, this is exactly what he ultimately most resembles. His repeated disinclination to answer questions put by an interlocutor and his preference instead for returning the question to its asker strikes me as even more guru-like and unsocratic. Finally, his eagerness to avoid extended one-on-one question and answer encounters in the presence of a group, preferring rather the role of the ""facilitator"" who gets everyone talking, reveals him more as the unwitting heir of the flattering John Dewey than of the ""offensive"" Socrates who claimed to know nothing, but was able to show smug others that they knew even less."

19591,0,Startin' to Hate Double Features!!,"My second heisei DVD and to a pretty low quality.

No wonder its two films for the price of one, what crummy quality!! This DVD makes the GMK DVD look good."
19603,0,"A bitter, rather nasty book","Of course Iris meant it to be bitter and nasty, a satire on upper middle class life and love in London in the 70's. I found most of the characters rang hollow.

19610,0,No Ginger Taste,"I bought these because the Altoid Ginger mints are no longer availabe in stores and you need to spend $20.00 or so and get boxes of them at Amazon. Unfortunately, these ginger candies did not do the trick for my nausea. They don't even taste gingery. They do have a pleasant enough taste though."
19611,0,Somewhat soothing...,"I was looking for anything to ease my pregnancy nausea. I read good reviews about these candies, so I promptly ordered them. Although they don't really take the nausea away, they do provide a somewhat soothing relief and take the edge off a bit. I've found that with my pregnancy sickness, I often get a yucky taste in my mouth after I eat, but chewing gum makes me feel even worse for some reason. These at least leave a pleasant taste in my mouth."
19612,0,okay for morning sickness relief,"From week 6 to week 12 of my pregnancy I threw up twice a day, and felt nauseous almost 24/7. I took anti-nausea medicine, but still felt awful and was searching for any relief. These got good reviews so I ordered 2 bags. I didn't even finish half a bag. They were ok, and somewhat took the nauseous edge away, but they weren't my first choice to try for relief. Honestly the best relief I got for morning sickness were sour icebreakers, and then lemonheads. I would buy these Gin Gins only if you enjoy ginger flavor and would eat them as regular candy anyways."
19613,0,The language and images are compelling,"But I couldn't finish this book. This is not the sort of book I'd normally choose to read but it was assigned by my book club. I savored the lovely images and have a great respect for the originality of the story, but ultimately I didn't care enough about the characters or the plot to continue with this lengthy read. Loved the opening chapter and was really pulled in with it, but then I got bored."
19615,0,My Opinion,Didn't care for the story. The Round House was much better. I love the way Ms. Erdrich writes however and would read her other books.
19621,0,Good But Not Great,"Just thought it was an average mystery. Very little romance. I'm not going to write a plot summary since so many on Amazon have already did that. I had problems getting into the characters. I just felt like she didn't truly explore them and get you to feel what they were feeling. I enjoyed some of the plot twists but one of the reviews here had kinda ruined it for me, but it was also easy to figure out. I liked the premise of the radio talk show psychologist host. I was hoping that Ms. Kane would go into that area more to heighten the mystery thriller part of the book. As for romance, there wasn't any build up to that and you didn't feel their instanteous attraction either. Just wasn't believable. I will definitely try another one of her books just because of her plot premise. Don't want to buy this book. This is strictly a library checkout book."
19623,0,"3.5 Stars, but not quite 4","It was a little ""out there"", you really have to suspend your disbelief. Very cute and fairly different setting, in the music world.The side characters just got to be too much for me. I did not feel as if they focused enough on Kylie and David, Ms. Brandt was trying to get side stories going, and that part just did not work for me. She kept introducing different characters, and a couple you could never see the purpose of brining in to the story line, but overall very enjoyable.Kylie is an adorable doofus, and David is a tight, I can't love anyone, because of my awful childhood type. Kylie loosens him up. Fun read, especially if you skim the extra parts, (you will see what I mean). Maybe get this one at the used store though."

She has rented a strange oldmansion with secrets. The lady along with her family have decided tostay in the house regardless of strange happenings.

I feel that some of the sexuality was not necessary, but in a way, it explained some of Countess Bathory's actions. It was hard to finish the book (I read it in 3 days) because I felt disgusted and frustrated that Countess Bathory herself was not tortured as she had done to innocent girls. I threw the book at my wall a couple of times in disgust. This is a very disturbing book, and I don't recommend it to someone my age!"
19637,0,BED SKIRT,"This waas exactly what I was looking for. Delivery was as one would expect. The odor of the material was awful! It took 3 washing with fabric softener to clear that smell.

19642,0,"Before there was the Internet, there was....","The Guinness Books of World Records. The 1989 version was the last one I got, and I read it cover to cover. I was in junior high school then, and being able to pick out this fact or that fact was quite an accomplishment for my age group. This book was quite long, and the amount of feats and facts was in it was a challenge to go thru, but still manageable at under 500 pages. Nowadays, the Guinness books have all sorts of stuff that were not included back in 1989, like the longest ear hairs!. But we have the Internet now, which can provide all sorts of facts that even the people of Guinness could not have imagined."
19643,0,"Feels nice, but also feels cheap.","Ok, I agree with some others that this item is cheaply made. The material isn't great and it's more plush than I thought it would be. I also didn't get it in black & white. It came in an off white (almost extremely light teal) and black. Not ugly though, so I'm ok with that...it's just inconsistent. A note should be put on here that it may not come as pictured. For $10, I think it's a bit pricey (again because it feels cheap). BUT, it is quite comfortable for the neck. The only annoyance is that since it's bulky, it may push your head forward, therefore arching your back in a funny posture. So if you're going to use this while sitting on a couch or on a plane (if you're small like me and can't reach the top of the seat with your neck), you'll need a pillow to support your back as well.

Didn't Kiss come out with a box set and an album called ""Greatest Kiss"" recently.Not to mention ""Double Platinum"", ""Smashes, Thrashes, & Hits"" & ""You Wanted The Best..."".You can not fault the music. The songs are imbedded in the hearts and souls of every kid who grew up with this band in the 70's. ""Ace Frehley, lead guitar!"" But the recycling of the music over and over is wearing thin. NO unreleased studio or live tracks, NO new music at all. ""If it wasn't for the fans we would be nothing"", Simmons always boasts. Well I am a Kiss fan, a Stones fan, an Aerosmith fan, a Skynyrd fan, a Tull fan, a Blue Oyster Cult fan, a Who fan etc...etc....and I ain't biting anymore.

If they had included these songs also MAYBE just MAYBE I would have bought it."
19680,0,Two Tristanoites reunited,"This album reunites Konitz with the pianist Sal Mosca. Mosca is a puritan in terms of his playing: its adherence to Tristano's idiom is absolute; Konitz, on the other hand, had long since left behind his early style of playing, & here, while he touches on it, his sound is often pungent (close to Anthony Braxton in spots), his lines canny & unorthodox. Half of the album is duets with Mosca; the other half has the rhythm section of Ron Carter and Mousie Alexander.Hard to know what to say about this album: it's of course like anything of Konitz's worth the closest attention. I'm rather less enamoured of Mosca here: first, because the piano he's been given is pretty ugly-sounding (did they _tune_ it before the session?); secondly because he often tends to sound simply dour where Tristano himself would be electrifying.Certainly worth a listen; maybe not quite as remarkable as the personnel listing might suggest."

The third disc includes bonus features without a passcode for the downloading of the digital copy. Blue ray works fine ...I just wish I would have the copy for long trips to view on the iPad.
19695,0,Cute Movie,"The movie was cute. There were a lot of words and references that the kids had no clue about. However they stayed entertained most of the movie. They said they liked it afterwards. My kids are both girls, 3 and 6. My 6 year old did seem distracted once or twice, but my 3 year old was paying attention the whole time, even though I know she didn't understand quite a few parts.Overall a decent family movie, but not much to make it stand out other than a happy ending you knew was coming."
19697,0,Morris is still the man!,"As you have read the other reviews, this album could have been way more LIVE!It's such a waste 2 have The Time on a live album and have the songs cut short and have certain words censored(What the Funk?).I still love hearing these jams though and the four new cuts show that Morris can change with the ""times"".Did you know that Prince named Morris as his favourite drummer in ""Modern Drummer"" magazine?! That's some major publicity and respect. I hope The Time come out with a full length album with all the original members, we need a change in this boring age of typical R&B.If you really want live check out Cameo's album ""Nasty""(serious funk)."

19715,0,Great Story.,"I did not grow up with the Oz books. I first read this story when I was about 11. And I WAS surprised at how DIFFERENT it was from the MGM movie. So many things were changed, added and cut. This story is both delightful and charming. A living scarecrow, a woodman made of tin and a lion that is cowardly all go searching for wisdom, love and courage that they all already have. But in this ORIGINAL story it talks a lot about DEATH, and there are some VIOLENT and SCARY scenes that I am GLAD that MGM either ommited or just didn't put in. Especially since most of those scenes involve my dear Tin Woodman. I am having so much trouble accepting my dear Tin Woodman being once a man of flesh and bone and having a REAL name (Nick Chopper) and being the King of the Winkies and especially not seeming to have a REAL heart. Especially since Denslow's illustrations make him look so positively CUTE!"

19719,0,Free SF Reader,"Someone pointed out a movie reviewer who has succinct entertaining reviews, via livejournal, and the one for this story went something like this:-Girl stars adventure with a killing, gets three friends, and goes off to kill some more. (A Canadian movie reviewer I think they said. Which, really is pretty funny. Good enough to shamelessy borrow and rehash seeing I had never seen that before.Of course, not really the point of the kid's story, as such, with its fables about being accepted, but a good one nonetheless. Monkeys fly, but not out of anyone's butt, unfortunately."
19722,0,Wrong Title,"From the tracklisting, this appears to be the Go + EP, a giveaway with copies of Go 2, and not the album itself. It's pretty much Andy Partridge's dub versions of songs from Go 2. Probably of interest to die-hard XTC fans only, and completists."

However, I did not think the CD sound was very good and the FM radio was full of static. I did not put up the hang-up antenna because I wouldn't want that thing hanging on my wall. Also the AM was not very clear and the directions said to turn the player around until it was good. No thanks! I did not try the record player. I had had enough."
19747,0,Merely Average,"This movie wasn't as good as people made it out to be. Most of the funnier parts are ruined in the previews. Regardless, there are a few places to make you laugh. I don't think the outakes are very funny. He's an idea to remember; an outake isn't in the original film since it wasn't funny enough to be there in the first place. I would suggest a rental."
19757,0,Not worth all the hype,"Considering the immense hype that surrounded the release of this film with coments such as ""the funniest film of the year"" my expectations were high. This was a maximum three star movie and I would not recommend it. The pace is slow the gags are a partial atempt at slapstic but at the same time trying to maintain the Hollywood sense of cool. Diaz plays the limiting role of the women stalked by obsessive lovers. The writing gives for a wooden performance that aside from her looks does not do credit to her acting abilities. It bumbles along through some entertaining moments but looses it's way about 2/3 into the action with a very dissapointing ending culminating in an array of unimaginative scripting and wooden acting. One best left to true Diaz fans only in my opinion."

19775,0,...,"I give it a 3...and THAT'S just being nice! I am a HUGE Ludacris fan, but this cd, it was worthless. It's the same as his last one, ""Back for the First Time"", basically.

I would say, don't bother buying the cd, get it ... or somewhere! I don't mind the occasional ""slip of the tongue"" words he uses, but Luda is rhyming about the same stuff, money, cars, & ...I'm getting sick of it already! I think he is a phenominal artist who can ride any beat, but his content is getting repetitive!

19778,0,Back to the Anemone.,"This short story takes place after the adventures of the movie FINDING NEMO. Basically, it tells what happens to Nemo during a day in school. Other than that, there is no plot. The illustrations are not the quality of stills and shots from the film, but are recognizable. This is a decent book for young children who have seen the movie and also makes a decent gift for any fan of the film."
19780,0,USB no-go if you have Win95!,"Good camera, bad news for those with Windows 95B (USB support). Even though the technical data says ""USB interface"" and ""minimum system requirements Win95/98/2000"", you have to have Win98 to use the USB interface. Which leaves us Win95B users stuck buying another expensive piece of equipment to download the pictures into our PC. I'm not even confident that it will work if I upgrade to Win98 because the instruction booklet says ""Pre-loaded Win98"". I don't know exactly what that means.I do like the camera, though I had to return the first one because of a slight discoloration on the left side of the screen during movie mode."
19781,0,....,"The PDR-M60 is a more economical choice. 2 megapixels is all you need for 8X10 prints.The M70 is just the M60 with: a) 3.3 megapixels instead of 2.3 b) a movie movie (how useful is a 2 minute movie? it just takes up valuable space), c) an extra 32MB of memory (24 onboard and a 16MB card instead of 4mb card included),Other than that the optics, flash, and various shooting features are identical....the movie mode is cute but not something I'll use more than once or twice.All that being said, if you absolutely have to have 3+ megapixels, the PDRM70 is a good choice.Either way, using rechargable AA batteries is the way to go. Being able to buy a couple of Alkaline batteries in a pinch beats missing out on pictures. My Sony's propriatery rechargable batteries were...unreliable."

19800,0,Finally coming to DVD,"The last John Carpenter film to be released on DVD, ""Memoirs of an Invisible Man"" bombed at the box office during it's early 90's theatrical run. Shame too as it's a better film than some think.The special effects were outstanding, and Sam Neill stole the show as the villian. Chevy Chase tries his best but even semi-dramatic roles are just not his thing.The DVD will be 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen (as all Carpenter films should be presented), and will have a behind-the-scenes featurette, outtakes, and the film's trailer. The sad thing is, no Carpenter commentary track. Why Warner Brothers never bothered to ask Carpenter to take part, we can only guess.Buy this DVD and complete your John Carpenter collection!"
19801,0,Carpenter's worst is better than most,"No, this is NOT John Carpenter's finest hour but even at his worst, he can make a better film than most of the dreck we see today.Chevy Chase plays it straight here (thank god) but it's Sam Neill (playing a nefarious government agent) who steals the show.Like most Carpenter fans, we want ALL of his movies on DVD but Warner Brothers has yet to release this on DVD yet.

19803,0,Unbelievable Motives,"I fould the book to be entertaining. However, I thougth the author did not develop Dr. Spier's character in a believable way. In particular, Dr. Spier's actions seemed too outrageous and other than to move the plot along, I just did not understand his motives or circumstances for acting the way he did.Also, having Ed Pinkerton's character just magically accomplish various feats for Dr. Spier seemed a little too convenient. I would have liked to see a more creative development of the plot.Having said that, it was a quick read and the action was entertaining."
19806,0,This practical guide assists them well a neophyte's need in veterinary acupuncture.,"It is a simple and easy book of understanding, of the way that the students, in his course beginning, need to understand the Chinese medicine. But for a professional acupunturist he also has his usefulness, because that the part 3 on treatment serves more commonly as a fast guide of treatment for the diseases found. Its serves as a book of incomes. In spite of knowing that the Chinese medicine seeks the treatment of the patient and not of the disease in itself, trying to balance the patient, nevertheless, as a first treatment this book aids the professional to give the first steps. I recommend a lot of this book to students of veterinary Chinese medicine and the acupunturists that are in the beginning of his professional life as acupunturist."
19808,0,On a Wing and a Dale,"Nope. Sorry, but I am just not as rapturous as fellow reviewers about the Wingdale's debut. There's nothing amiss with the set, and the songs are fine enough. But none of them are memorable. I admit I was lured to sample the product having swooned over Moody's, 'Purple America' and this is simply not a distinguished showcase of his writing skills. While his best writing compares favourably with contemporary American literature, the music herein drowns amongst hundreds of similar aspirants. It's a capable outfit, without sounding any bells."
19810,0,outdated,"The biggest drawback for this title is Gall & de Waal's story ends with the chechen recapture of Grozny in 1996 and the subsequent peace treaty. It fails to follow the story through the Chechen terrorist bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and the Russian military response.So for anyone that is used to sorting out the liberal US media, identifying the authors' allegiance to the Chechen cause is surmountable; knowing that their story is painfully outdated is more important to a prospective buyer."
19813,0,"Great show, bad CD","""Goes Forth"" is great, and all the best things said in the other reviews apply. However, on DVD the laugh track is too loud, especially in episode one, where it really interferes. There are two areas in the extra features section which are ""buggy"": the narration in the Historical References as well as Cast Information cuts off halfway through the narration in each and every item or cast member except the 2 or 3 that are under 10 seconds long. $&@# annoying!"
19815,0,A Fun & Easy Read,This book is perfect for reading in short bursts whenever you have a minute. It's broken up into so many small sections that you can practically start and stop on any page without losing your place. It has a rambling plot that presents an interestingly different viewpoint of the world around us.
19831,0,Interesting,"I am always a sucker for submarine movies. This one, on board modern super-submarines, is interesting though in parts not very credible. Good entertainment."
19836,0,"fun movie, lousy transfer to DVD","Red October is unquestionably the most entertaining of the Tom Clancy movies. Connery in particular does a nice job as the Russian sub captain and the rest of the cast is good as well. Great editing keeps the story moving without getting bogged down in unnecessary character development (let's face it, Tom Clancy characters don't generally need a lot of development). The underwater sub battle at the end is remarkably well shot--it is made clear to the viewer exactly what is happening with all three subs that are invoked.My complaint is with the picture quality of this DVD. This is a fairly recent movie, and a popular one, so there is absolutely no excuse for the grainy picture quality through much of the movie as well as noticeable white specks in many scenes, particularly the dimly lit sub-interior scenes. Home theater buffs are going to be disappointed at a transfer that really isn't too much better than VHS."
19837,0,listen up,Stop complaining about the 2-3second pause...it's normal because the dvd has to switch layers becuase of the lenth of the movie. If they didnt use rsdl then you would have to flip the disc....
19842,0,SUBMERGED,"This is the first Tom Clancy/Jack Ryan novel adapted to the screen, and while it's production values are high and its cast capable, I found HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER to be too long on talk, too short on action, and too long overall. Sometimes movies that take places on subs can become claustrophobic and tedious, and I found that to be the case in this film. While Sean Connery is marvelous as the Russian captain, and Alec Baldwin makes an effective Ryan, the movie's pacing is too slow and the action sequences are stiff and uninvolving. It also takes the entire movie to find the motivation for Connery's actions. But the movie boasts a fine supporting cast: Courtney B. Vance, Scott Glenn, Peter Firth, Sam Elliott, Joss Ackland, Richard Jordan, and Stellan Starsgaard are all fine. A crisper, sharper editing might have made it a classic, but as it stands, it's merely a competent drama."
19843,0,Excellent film. Horrible transfer.,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is also THE WORST QUALITY VHS CASSETTE I HAVE EVER SEEN. The picture is grainy with dust flecks everywhere, colors are weak, and the dialog is terribly muddy. I considered returning this VHS cassette and exchanging it for the DVD. After reading reviews of the DVD, I realized that these are not just VHS problems. Paramount cut corners mastering this film and it shows. Frankly, this movie looked better on HBO. I hate to encourage copyright infringement but Paramount deserves it for shelling out this garbage. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Go get a good blank tape and record it off HBO. Your copy will probably look and sound better than the crap Paramount put on the shelves."
19852,0,"Oh, this is a good, sappy book!","I had enjoyed the first book that I read by this author (Magic Hour: A Novel), but I thought that was mostly due to the subject matter (feral children). This book shared similarities in that it too was about families and children. And also that the family was so unrealistic.Still, it was an enjoyable and certainly escapist-fast read. I will most likely read more by her - though I doubt I will ever pay full price.In many ways, this author is reminiscent of Jodi Picoult - though on a more superficial, beach-read type of level.Still, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a sappy, sentimental-type book."
19853,0,I had some issues with this story,"SPOILERS INSIDE!!This book was very readable, yet very predictable. The predictability didn't bother me so much as the ending. Yes I was happy that Angie & Con got back together. I knew David & Lauren didn't have a chance, but for Lauren to keep the baby and not take the scholarship??? STUPID! If she'd let Angie and Con adopt the baby they'd all be one big happy family and that's what I wanted.Loved the depiction of Italian family life. I am not Italian but grew up in a very Italian area and the DeSaria family seemed very realistic to me.I would definitely read more of Kristin Hannah's books."
19855,0,"Touching story, albeit slightly cliche.","All in all, Hannah told a moving story of two women who filled the gaps in each others' lives. Hannah's writing style initially bored me, and I found myself annoyed with the emphasis on the main character and her issues for much of the beginning. I began to change my mind toward the middle of the book, but the predictable plot turn and cliche overarching message makes this a so-so read."
19863,0,"Great Songs, Horrible Audio","The dvd engineers could have put much more effort into this. Visually, it's not bad, but, not great either. To attempt to really hear this, you have to put the volume at such a high level it's distorted. The hiss can't be removed even when you turn the treble and front mid levels way down. Don't try to blast this, you'll only damage your speakers . I bought it because it's Elvis. For the non-diehard fan, I say hold off buying this and send complaints to MGM with the rest of us. We deserve a remastered version asap. Even for 70's audio equipment, this is pretty bad. An easy five star dvd if the audio was better."
19877,0,Well ....... I think it may be better than,"I grabbed this book and started the brain sucking upall the information I could. Whoops! Where is it?

19885,0,An introductory book,"This is the first book I bought for learning UNIX. I must say that I don't have any experience on UNIX before. I believe this is an introductory book rahter than the ""intermediate to advanced"" as claimed by the auothor. It really talks about UNIX, but it talks about many thing (internet, screen editors, etc) that relate to other OS as well (Mac, Windows NT, etc). I believe this book is for those readers who don't know anything about UNIX (like me), but definitely not for ""intermediate to advanced user"". A point to mention is that shell script is introduced at very beginning and this will confuse the beginners much (me again =)."
19887,0,Not Enough Culture,"Theodore Mommsen's Provinces of the Roman Empire will provide an indescribable wealth of material for readers concerned with Rome's military history, expansion and growth, from Caesar to Diocletian. While this book lacks the eloquence and depth of Gibbon, and reads more like reference material than pure history, it still must be regarded as the foremost authority upon the subjects it covers. The only real negative about this immense work is the fact that rarely is anything said about culture. Its hard to believe that a book illuminating the history of the provinces has almost entirely overlooked the cultural impact Rome had on the provinces and likewise that the provinces had on Rome."
19888,0,Reasonable but not amazing,"Decent clippers, plastic fittings are kinda cheap and dont always clip on/off easily. Bare blades do not cut very close either. Otherwise works quite well and the cordless function is fantastic!"
19897,0,Can't play this classic on DVD,The DVD is not made to show in this region (USA) and would not play on any of our three DVD players. I finally was able to go in and change the laptop settings to reflect REGION 2 which was the United Kingdom and watch the movie. I don't think it should have been sold without a notification about the region issue. It is a great classic movie and except for the limiting factors of the laptop was enjoyed.
19901,0,Old Fashioned and Creepy,"This is a really old fashioned, creepy campaign novel for Ravenloft, as they reissue old 1900s TSR novels, concentrating on Ravenloft with the 1990s novels. A lot of this stuff is hard to find and out of print."
19906,0,"not his best, but still the fantastic Baum","In the Land of Oz, where animals talk and logic is delightfully warped and fairies mingle with mortals and clockwork men, Betsy Bobbin and her mule Hank are shipwrecked. Along with Queen Ann's army, Polychrome, the Shaggy Man, Ozga (the Rose Princess), and Tik Tok, Betsy and Hank find themselves on a rescue mission for Shaggy's brother imprisoned by the selfish Nome King. Filled with Baum's signature Romanticism and clever logic, it's a lovely (though not particularly unique or as distinct) addition to the Oz series. The Marvelous Land of Oz and The Tin Woodman of Oz are still the strongest in the series. Grade: B"

19919,0,The good the bad and the ugly....,"The good...Wetton's voice is wonderful by any measured standard, and, he is in good voice on this recording. His reading of the pieces is spot on. He is so good in fact that he ""almost"" obliterates the technical concerns of the CD.The bad...The guitar work is redundant and even annoying at times. It gets in the way of some of the finer pieces on the CD. The recording is borderline acceptable (see the ugly).The ugly...The first time I heard this CD it sounded like it was mixed through one of my cheap junior high school guitar amps with bad reverb. It has a very hollow sound, like it was recorded from a bad seat in the arena. The hollow sound affects the guitar on some of the cuts and gives it a terrible TWANG sound. The fact that the same note that goes TWANG is hit over and over again throughout the CD doesn't help it.This is NOT an amazing recording, at least not given the history of Wetton's work. He has put out far better."
19925,0,Just OK.....,"This book was just OK. It is about a girl, Jennifer, who really wants a horse. All she ever wanted was a horse!

How will Jennifer be able to hide Moonseeker?"
19926,0,"I'd mosey on past this one, partn'r....classic or not.","I occasionally enjoy a good western, but how ""Riders of the Purple Sage"" ever got to be considered a western classic is beyond me. Between the sickeningly chivalrous Lassiter, the nave but always-dutiful Jane (and the rest of the set-piece characters), I could easily imagine it was written by Louisa May Alcott or one of the Bronte sisters in their father's attic. This may be worth a try if you've never read Zane Grey before and want to give it a try but I think I'll stick with Jack Schaffer (try ""Monte Walsh""), Louis L'Amour, Larry McMurtry or A.B. Guthrie from now on."
19929,0,Mixed Basket,"The further back in the book, the more vanilla it got. I can see why one person wrote that the author was obsessed with the Wizards. (paraphrased)I love the scenarios and best practices in the first part of the book.Later on you wonder why they put in some of the chapters. This book may be a good place to start if you know nothing. I enjoyed much of the book, but I need to buy another book that gets more into the specifics."
19932,0,Puzzle is OK,So I was looking for a puzzle of the NY skyline and I wanted one with the Twin towers in it. As it turns out my options were limited but I ended up liking this one because of all the colors with the fireworks and it was quite large as well. Some of the piece came bent and it was hard at times to put it together because piece that went together didn't fit very well and it wasn't until I go large chunks of it together that they actually started to fit together like they should. Also the variety of the pieces as far as shape goes was lacking. You just get your standard edge pieces with either to holes in the sides or two prongs in the sides (sorry don't know technical terms) and for the inside puzzle pieces it the same...every piece has two holes and two prongs. Also as a side note...I was disappointed that one of the towers didn't have the communications antenna on it...kind of down graded them to just really tall towers instead of THE twin towers.
19934,0,catalog of parallels in different mythologies and religions,"Eliade presents an impressive collection of data from the religions and mythologies of an incredible number of different cultures, organized according to recurring themes: sky gods, agricultural goddesses, cycles of death and rebirth, and so on. It is an interesting resource for the student of comparative religion, but seems to lack a coherent interpretive framework. I'm left with unsatisfied curiosity to know what Eliade believed is to be learned from this collection of parallels. Perhaps his other writings provide more interpretation, but this book (although it contains many interesting ""gems"") seems incomplete as a stand-alone volume."
19935,0,Only Good if running 3 or 4 cables only!,"I personally bought two wire management kit eventhough I needed 3 more or so, just to test it out. This wire management kit it's only good if you're running 3 or 4 cables that are not too big. I tried running about 6 or 7 cables being that I'm not using HDMI connections and the product is useless because the cover keeps coming off.Thanks,"
19940,0,Out of date,The Novell course has been updated and this book no longer contains adequate information. While it may be possible to pass the updated test using this material it is unlikely.
19947,0,the american neverending story...,"I love this film so much. That depends also on the great soundtrack written by Klaus Doldinger. I only knew the German version and I have seen the American version now. But I was disappointed a bit because the film music of the German movie is different from the American, and I must say the german is much better!!! I can't understand why the producer used a different soundtrack for the same film. I can only offer watching the German version or listening the German film music!!!"
19950,0,Let's hope a Region One disc comes along.,"Is there a video transfer error or is it just me? It seems that in one specific scene we don't get to see the entire glow from one of the yellow sphinxes. Other than that, there's the minor inconvenience of having to turn off the subtitles before viewing the movie. Quite frankly, when I think of the steep price I payed, the inconveniences I just mentioned seem quite more annoying."
19960,0,Clark Griswold strikes again.......in Europe!!!!!!!,"The Griswolds stumble into victory on a goofy gameshow and win an ""all inclusive"" vacation around Europe. While Clark and Ellen provide their usual hilarious antics, the children do not meet up to par. Rusty is boring and Audry is fat and annoying. This movie however is a must for Chevy Chase fans. One classic line from the movie comes when Rusty is whining (as usual) about wearing a beret when they get to France, Clark says to him, ""That's the national hat there fella!"" You have to see it to appreciate it. Personally I was not disappointed."
19961,0,Classier than film one,Although the original Audrey in National Lampoon's Vacaction was a really cute girl (I had a crush on her when I saw the film in 1983) Dana Hill does a fairly good bit replacing her here. Chase and D'Angelo are back in top form (especially D'angelo) as the Griswold parents. I love Mrs. Griswold's stripping scene she performs in fron't of her husband's camera. The European locations beat the scenes of Chicago and the southwest from film one in giving the 2nd film much more sophistication. Eric Idle is painful to watch (like he is in all his non-Python work) in an irregular series of cameos.
19962,0,Problems with audio,"This is a review of the DVD itself, not the movie (not sure why people seem to want to review the movie itself in this forum).Overall, a good quality reproduction of the original. (This version does have the topless scenes, for those that have children...) However, the audio is not surround. When you play through a 5.1 speaker system, all the audio goes straight to the center speaker. I am not sure if this was a problem with the disc I received or the DVD in general.Extras: There are no deleted scenes. The only worthwhile extra is Chevy Chase's commentary, which is actually quite funny and revealing."
19969,0,I was expecting more,"This is my second Perl book, and compared with the Dummies Guide I found it wanting. Being new to perl I hoped that the NT flavour would help me avoid all the problems of trying to run the typical Unix Perl scripts on NT. It's probably not that bad when coupled with a useful refrence book though."
19973,0,small - CT,This arrived quickly and after reading the reviews before purchase I embraced for the delivery. I purchased the white one. This item is cute and it is small. I believe the problem is that on the scroll of metal there is clear beading instead of actual crystals. Since this is for my nursery I don't mind but if its for a girls who is pre-teen i would probably opt for another chandelier.I did not think that I would mind not having shades but since it is so small I ordered lamp shades from another place but even the mini shades are too big for this chandelier.I have a big nursery so my chandelier looks a little lost in there but I still like it.Hope this helps.
19974,0,Overall nice with one small catch,"Overall I am happy with this light. I bought it to go over my teenage daughter's bed and she loves it. For the price it is perfect for this setting; however; although it can be plugged in vs. being direct wired there is no on and off switch. That means it must continually be plugged in and unplugged. I might have it rewired for that reason, but it is exactly the style she wanted and the amount I was willing to spend."
19984,0,Princess Bride is a love novel and a fairy tale,"In the movie they left out the Zoo of death which would have made the video a whole lot better, because they would have seen how good prince humperdinck was of a tracker and the pit of despair was just to dull. The albino in the movie got knocked out and didnt help Inigo and Fezzik which didnt give any credit to the albino because he was always trying to help westley. prince humperdinck should have been a fat man with a bad temper and always looked mad because in the movie he was not fat and was not mad all the time."
19992,0,"Sweet, but not really something meant for the eternity","A cute and funny parody, something you would definitely buy for your kids, but not really the classic most reviews claim it to be!"
19997,0,Story is good. Literary device detracts.,"The story itself is a good one. Everything in the movie and more. It actually explained a thing or two that the movie was unclear on.The ""literary device"" of the fictional S. Morgenstern, and the fictional missing chapter, and the fictional tale of the author detracted from the story, for me. Luckily he put all that ""stuff"" in italics and it was fairly easy to skip around. However, you had to bypass 50-60 pages at the beginning just to get to the story. Then there is more scattered throughout the chapter. The ending ""after the ending"" had a lot more to wade through. Easily 100 pages were wasted on me.I hope others enjoy the ""literary device"".Regardless, the story itself is very worth reading."
20005,-1,Nothing you don't already know,"If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!"
20007,-1,TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk."
20009,-1,Very poor quality.,"The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The ""finish"" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid."
20017,-1,Dont like it,This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
20025,-1,Just a few.,"These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as ""sealed Door"", ""wings across time"" or ""At the Bottom of the Night"".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!"
20029,-1,Has No Range,"I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product."
20044,-1,I guess it was a mystery,"In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia."
20046,-1,Nasty People! Nasty Film!,Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film.
20050,-1,Absolutely NOTHING Funny !,This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20053,-1,Stupid....,Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this. Let alone the story line was ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend!
20059,-1,Not Funny People,Not worth the time.Pros: there were several good one-liners; introduced me to new comediansCons: excess foul language; adultry;
20061,-1,Self-Serving Message,"This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children."
20062,-1,Not what it looks like on the cover.,"As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book."
20069,-1,A Piece of Crap!,"Noisy, crude five point vibration pad.NOT! a massager, a vibration pad!We purchased three of these and we sent back three of these!Worthless, no, worse than worthless!"
20073,-1,"Capitalism straight, in small unpalatable doses","If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice."
20078,-1,Straight to the trash can!,"Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!"
20079,-1,It wasn't very good!,"This book was about witches and possession. I do not believe in those things. I am a Christian! I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review."
20080,-1,on order,I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.
20092,-1,Too small,Usually a size XS to S but this girdle's small did not fit true to size. Had to return back to Amazon.
20098,-1,Good story- Poor writing,"Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. This reads like a first attempt, not like a book written by a seasoned author of over 30 books."
20100,-1,This is not the Jack Higgins I know,"This is by far his worst effort that I've read. He's not my favorite spy author,anyway. This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher's contract or obligation that Mr. Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry. The characters are not at all fleshed out, and the story line is too contrived. I would advise not wasting time by reading this book."
20103,-1,I'd rate it 0 stars if I could have...,"Very few books contain their own review. This one does:""Stone said, 'It really is like a bad movie, Harry.'""'You can bleeding well say that again. . . .'""This book reads like a 7th grade reading-level condensation of an outline of a screenplay: The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long; very few words greater than two syllables are used. No complex thoughts, no character development, no suspense, and little description. Pure formulaic twaddle."
20106,-1,Can't believe the publisher had nerve to issue this book,"A terrible, childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Higgins loves to ""speak Irish"" but even that gambit fails in this trite, poorly plotted, worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can't do any better than such trashy writing."
20107,-1,Two Hacks,"I don't know who is worse- Higgins or Macnee. The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next. Completely implausible. Macnee's narration is so overdone it is laughable. Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts of Bushmills Irish Whisky. A real stinker. Wayne Schwartz, Los Angeles, CA"
20112,-1,Duller than dirt,"I teach high school English, and was required to teach thisto my students. I don't know who suffered more, me or them.To be fair, as one of America's first novels, it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good job.On the other hand, it is excruciating to read. There is nosuspense, little to sympathize or empathize with, and evenless to enjoy. A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages. Some have labelledthis book a tragedy; they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad."
20117,-1,Avg. Rating too high,"I've bought this book, underlined every hint of symbolism, found all evidence of romanticism, followed every quote involving thematic oppositions, and noted every example of Pearl's rebellious nature and social alienation, but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding. The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace."
20119,-1,Oh my...,"This novel is absolutely awful. Although it has received over 500 reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs, at zero. Where to begin... perhaps with the run on sentences, the failure to create significant rising action, the flat two dimensional characters... This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader, but frustrate them as well.The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant. Post-modern society does not really care about, ""Baby daddies,"" and the revelation which is made at the end, and beginning, of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury. Unfortunately, Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster."
20124,-1,Don't pay for this on the Kindle,"Unless you have the correct size font, you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle. It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text, the next line has a single word, then another full line and so on."
20126,-1,I HATE THIS BOOK,"I'm sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much better, if Hawthorne were not writing in some sort of moon man language. I don't know about the production of narcotics in the 1800's, but I honestly think that Hawthorne wasn't on a natural high if you know what I'm saying."
20130,-1,I only gave it a star because I had to.,"This was the worst book I ever read. I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence. You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness, but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life. It's no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic, he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book. If you are a high school student,like I am, you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again. And to you who have no read this book, don't. You have not, or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Oh, and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book, there is nothing romantic about this novel, nor anything good. If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown, they can actually write!"
20133,-1,Painful,"This was one of the most boring books i've ever read. Unfortunately i did not give up on Hawthorne after reading this novel, that was a mistake. I'd pass on this one if i were you, if you must read this for school I highly suggest getting a summary online."
20154,-1,Illegible,"It was an illegible **photocopy**. It appeared as if someone took a picture of every page of an original ""Principles of Science"", then faxed those pictures to the printer in order to produce this book.I returned it immediately."
20155,-1,Why so expensive??!,"Why does this series need to be so much more expensive than most of the other TV shows? Especially considering these don't even have the original soundtrack. The first thing I think of when I think about My Three Sons is the great music that went along with the show, and it's missing from this way over-priced version. As much as I love My Three Sons, I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy."
20166,-1,The book is irrelevant; how about the author?,"In reading use comments about Yanni's album ""If I Could Tell You"" I noticed this author advertised his book. Regardless of the book's merits, I think it should be rejected due to the author being a shallow, inappropriate capitalist.PS I'm proud of myself for not swearing at Mr. Mcandrew in this post."
20178,-1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IBOOK G4,"I'm sure this product is great for G4 Powebooks and G3 iBooks, but nowhere in this product description does it say that this adapter is NOT for use with iBook G4s. I tried this on my iBook G4, and the computer kept switching back and forth between battery power and the power supply from the adapter. I'm returning this to Amazon tomorrow, but am upset that I wasted $20 overnighting this adapter because I absolutely need to use my computer this weekend. I wish they would update the product description to make it explicit that this is for Powerbook G4s and iBook G3s ONLY."
20181,-1,Faulty Product - Horrible Support,"I plugged this item into my laptop and nothing happened. No power- nothing.When I unplugged this adapter the negative metal ring from the plug stayed lodged inside of my computer, I had to remove it with needle nose pliers.I had to call the company 5 times before getting a rep on the phone as I was continually placed in automated limbo for about 15 per call. The rep actually admitted to me that this happens alot because the rings are too small and fit to tight in the computers.I was really looking forward to saving some dough. But this adapter was surprisingly worse the the original that came with the computer.They are sending me return authorization."
20184,-1,Poorly made product,"The Macally PS-AC4 Power Adapter would not charge my PowerBook. I tested it with a multimeter, and found that it had an open lead.I contacted Amazon (even better, through their web site - no waiting on the phone or waiting for an email), and they shipped another.This second one had the same problem as the first.I contacted Amazon again for a refund.The product was junk, but the service was excellent!"
20187,-1,Works great... for about a month,"Everything the other reviews say about this product is largely true: the cord is thicker and more durable than the Apple adapter, the brick doesn't get as unnervingly hot, you can deal with the fact that it's not powerful enough to be used as a power source... but one day it just mysteriously stops working. I bought this to replace my broken Apple adapter and was generally very pleased with it, but about a month later I went to plug it in one day and it just wouldn't work. My laptop showed no connectivity, the little charge light on the brick didn't go on, and after tinkering with the thing at length I couldn't get anything to change. If you want a cheap, temporary replacement charger, I guess this would be fine. But for anything long-term it might just be worth shelling out $80 for something that at least lasts a year or two."
20193,-1,Disappointing and dangerous,"Like every other Mac user, I think the replacement power cord with the bulky, cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable, so I decided to outsource. What I got was never quite up to speed, but since my laptop mostly stays plugged in, the quick charge wasn't a must. Unfortunately, after a scant 8 months, with very little movement or unplugging (I've packed up my laptop for travel exactly twice in that time), the power cord has given out. There seems to be a short between the wires, with the hazardous side effect of causing random sparking at the connection between the computer plug-in and the wire. Needless to say, I'm not going back to this product!"
20196,-1,does not work,"I purchased this product and the DVD's don't even work. I can't even use them. I get nothing,no picture,nothing."
20203,-1,Monkeys Paw,How can anyone like this book??? its got to be the worst horror book I have ever read and I normaly like a good horror book now and then. I mean most Horror books or movies give me the creeps this one I could resd in the scaryest place in the world yaw and go to sleep. got to be the worst book ever writen by the way I am 13 just dont wana give out my account name on here later
20217,-1,I could have spent my money better,This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all.
20219,-1,Not like I remember it,I bought this book 'cause I loved the movie when I was a kid. The book is really dry and a little hard to relate to. It's very English with lots of Moor descriptions.Couldn't finish it. Want it?
20230,-1,waste of money!!!!!,"Oh man, this is horrible! I'm a Lara junkie, and I'm completely embarassed by this horrid game. The PC controls are a joke, you just seem to spin in circles when you're just trying to make a simple turn. I feel completely ripped off by the folks at Eidos for releasing such a bug filled game. Game locks up at the worst possible moments, cut screnes are too long and dull, just let us play the game without the need to watch a movie every level...put all that energy into fixing the movement controls and lock up issues. Please, don't waste your hard earned cash on this!!! Maybe Eidos will get the message."
20231,-1,Robocop dressed like Lara Croft,"I was expecting Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness since last year, with a similar performance as Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, but now when I receive the game, I saw this little girl that walks like with an umbrella inside of her pants.The graphics and sound are great, but Lara rotates like a robot and when I try to make her run, she doesn't agree with me and moves extremely slowly.I have a 2MHz PC with 500Megas RAM and GeForce4 Graphic Card, and there is no possibility that only this game needs to practice Ctrl-Alt-Del each 15 minutes in order to play it.I'll find the way to sell my game and suggest Eidos to make a research in order to define how many of the customers are really satisfied with this game and determine if a refund to the customers is the better way to maintain the good image of Eidos until today.It's a shame."
20239,-1,failed after 2nd application,"i never got this to work, it shorted out and is made out of cheap plastic. didn't come with all the attachments would not recommend this product"
20248,-1,BUYER BEWARE,This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....
20262,-1,Did not get what I ordered,"I just got these stockings but the seller sent me a way smaller size (A-B) than I ordered, I e-mailed them telling them about the problem and will keep you dear buyer posted. I cannot tell you about anything about the quality or color because I have not opened the ones I received."
20271,-1,Don't Bother,"This was a free kindle purchase. I guess you get what you pay for with the Kindle.This was absolute drivel! This writer neither knows southerners nor humour. The story was so unbelievable, it was laughable. Could not finish this pile of ..."
20275,-1,do not buy this piece of c--p,"do not buy The Great Indian Wars. the same hollywood movie stock played over and over, sometimes without even turning down the borrowed movie's audio. i couldn't concentrate on the narration, and that was a shame because the narration was very well written. the narrator also had a fine voice and read his stuff superbly. i felt sorry for him, being assocaited with something that went so bad through no fault of his own. someone ruined this ""documentary"" with the choice and use of the visual footage.i even tried turning off the picture and listening only to the narration but the silly dialogue and old-western music score made trying to listen only to the narrator sheer torture. i only wish i could have given this film a rating it really deserves. MINUS FIVE! the fact that they used 2 tapes when the entire length is only 96 minutes proves to me that the intent of the producers was only to flim-flam the public into thinking they were getting a lot for their money."
20277,-1,Not working correctly,"I purchased this a month ago and found out this was not working correctly.I had it pugged in and it went on by itself, then another time I could not control it with the remote....Not happy in Lynn, Mass"
20278,-1,Not happy with seller,I ordered and paid for an 8 ounce product and received a 4 ounce product. Now the seller wants me to take a picture of the product and the bar code and send it to them before they will make good on it. I've ordered from them before and there have been issues. Never again....What a pain.
20282,-1,I do not recommend this vacuum,"We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner."
20287,-1,OMG! this Movie is too wierd to be watched sober.,"I think it deserves the one star. maybe even 2 if I was drunk.... but I was'nt! Oh God, how I wish I had been. I can't tell you why I kept watching after the first half hour. I guess I expected it to become something .. ummm good..! quite an unusual film. if you watch it please tell me what you thought of it and what you think I missed. I don't watch Mexican movies ever..! & now I think I know why.... they make my brain all mushy and then it pours out of my ears and I fall over dead and brainless! OMG.. and the last 15 minutes... I could have slit my wrists, it was that bad! Sorry, Have I said too much.?"
20291,-1,Can't get it to work,"I used to love these rockets back in the day when I was a kid, so I got one for my 11-year old son. When it arrived, it looked like the ones I had as a kid, but was obviously of cheaper quality. Then again, it cost only a few bucks. Problem is, when I put the water in and then snap close the end of the pump, all the water leaks out! This happens whether the rocket is pointed up or down. The rocket is totally useless and we had to throw it away. Too bad, those rockets sure were fun a long time ago..."
20296,-1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"This is totally different from the ""classic albums"" series of DVDs that have come out which I love. This is a ""classic album under review"" which basically has a bunch of fat old guys talking about how great AC/DC is. The clincher for me was the fact that they had an AC/DC tribute band on to play the guitar riffs from this album. A TRIBUTE BAND?!?!? I'm sure that was great fun for those guys to do, but I think the people watching would rather see the actual band playing the songs. This DVD went on WAY too long and only had little snippets of the band playing live. Way too much filler for me and not what I thought this DVD was going to be. I do not recommend it."
20297,-1,Come on.............,"We know Back in Black was one of the best albums in history...do we really need some ""experts"" to tell us this ??I'm a big AC/DC fan I would not buy this...."
20300,-1,Beware,"The set is cute to look at, but as far as actually using, it is terrible. The glasses are fine, but the shaker is so hard to use, I actually took a chunk out of my finger trying to get it open to refill it! I've never used it again."
20309,-1,This DVD is not as represented in the description.,There are only 8 out of about 24 episodes from the Baking With Julia series on the DVD. Amazon would not guarantee me a full refund if I returned it since I took off the plastic.Even though I had not viewed it. I didn't notice that it was only 8 episodes till after a tore the plastic off and looked at the back of the dvd. Definitely is not work the money.
20311,-1,Dreadful,"3/4 of this book is where to shop, with locations noted in Chicago, Houston, Florence, Milan, NYC, Vienna, etc (but not Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong). The rest is spoiled by a pompous, overbearing style that makes it unreadable."
20319,-1,Nice Title!,"It's rather amusing that some harmonica band (or whatever the hell it is) decided to give their album the same title as one of the greatest rock albums in history (Styx: Pieces of Eight). And to Mr. ""Please push sales"" who wrote the other ""review"": I bet your cover art isn't QUITE as good as the incredible Hypgnosis masterpiece of the Styx album. ;-)"
20321,-1,Poor quality of wrapping,"I received my ""new"" product a few days ago but it wasn't in brand new conditions. The box had been worn around the edges and you can tell it had been rewrapped in a different plastic cover. When I pay extra money for a brand new item I expect it to be exactly that."
20323,-1,WANT REFUND!,"The movies do not play in my xbox 360 console, which is my only source of a DVD player. i would appreciate a full refund considering i had to wait over 3 weeks just to get the DVDs that don't work."
20325,-1,Not a real collection boxset.,"I like the movies and I want to add this trilogy to my DVD collection. However, this set is not a collection boxset that I am looking for. They are 3 separate spiderman movies in their own packages, and bundled together in a newly design cardboard box and called them ""Trilogy"".The worst is that they are the unsold inventory which they applied white stickers to cover the barcode in the back of each box. I felt cheated by Sony Pictures. They should have done a better job by creating a real boxset in a nice package with some additional materials.If you are looking for a nice collection boxset, please skip this set."
20330,-1,Phantom Glasses - Beware!,"Ordered on September 24, 2005 -- delivery now estimated by Amazon ""sometime"" after December 24, 2005. Three months (or more) for delivery seems excessive. Amazon should be ashamed for treating customers this way."
20331,-1,Flatout is flat,"This game has some good qualities, but the pure racing person will have issues, as you gain $ for running into objects and cars, which blows. You are in a race and losing, so blast your car and everyone around you to get $$ for the next race. Realistic? Not. They don't even have a view from inside the car, it is a bumper view with no part of the car visible. The interface with arrow buttons is bad, and you can't even race online, just by LAN. In short, stick with Leadfoot or DTRSC and you will be at least $40 better off.jc"
20334,-1,Brain washing,"I would like note that if you look at the footnotes for this book as to where they got there information, they do not have a shred of evidence to back them up. They simply state they they have forgone the traditional footnotes and that we should believe them just because they have a PHD. I know that if I were writing any type of paper for these gentlemen in college they would fail me if I didn't show where I got my information. Furthermore, There is a man in Texas who has the world's largest collection of artifacts from our founding fathers and he has loads of evidence which point to the extreme opposite. In fact he has a copy of bibles that were printed and distributed to every family in America through funding from Congress. I would encourage anyone who sees this to watch the documentary called ""MONUMENTAL"" by Kirk Cameron, exposes the truth about our constitution writers and points out the damage that books like these have caused to our society."
20351,-1,huh?,I just don't get it? I thought this book was a story about the paranormal and all the town needed to do was buy some Raid.Also anybody can tell you moths just son't grow that big... now June Bugs well now that's a story.
20352,-1,The Mothman in Bits and Pieces,"This book is NOT like the movie. In fact, I prefer the movie. The book is composed of bits and pieces of John Keel's and others' phenomenal experiences. It is difficult to read, not only because of the bad press printing, but also because it is very clipped and disjointed. I bought this book to delve further after seeing the movie, and ended up more confused. Go to the movie--forget the book!"
20354,-1,Why Can't I Rate at Zero Stars ?,"Come On, People !!!! I checked this out because Amazon emailed me saying it was top rated.... ??? Could it be because one of the ""songs"" is entitled ""Amazon"" ? Sex appeal !? Not !!!! - unless you want to have sex with a monkey.... And for those who think this is the best album they've heard in a long time - my condolences ! Seriously, this recording is nothing more than a possibly somewhat cute girl chanting gibberish over some low-fi computer generated noise loops. True artists should be outraged, and they would if they could stop laughing. I recommend steering way way clear of this sorry excuse for music. Please, people - don't let big music money tell you what is good - we all suffer for it in the end."
20356,-1,fine if you support terrorism,"I find the terrorist links in her songs offensive.Taken from Fire Fire-""Growin up, Brewin UpGuerilla gettin trained uplook out look outFrom over the Rooftop"" [reffering to LTTE snipers]""Competition coming up nowLoad up,Aim,Fire Fire,Pop""She has a lot of LTTE propaganda in her music website, and even promotes this terrorist organisation in her music. She needs to get a grip, and the people buying her music need to get a grip and actually look at what they're buying here."
20369,-1,Puzzling,"After all the hype, and comparison to Camus' ""The Stranger"", I suppose my expectations were high for this book. I found ""Autobiography of my Mother"" completely benign. In some parts, pointless. Unlike Camus' protagonist in ""The Stranger"", Xuela's world-view is too fully revealed to be cleverly wrought and too self-perpetuating to cause empathy with the reader. A self-pitying character, Xuela is hard to empathize with because she decries her father and the white ""conquerers"" for exploiting people and destroying the aboriginal population's culture; yet, Xuela also takes advantage of many -- emotionally and psychologically. Therefore, Xuela just comes across as bitter and codependent and the reader is not compelled to sympathize with her situation. I also found nothing sensual about the book -- the author's placement of masturbation description seemed to come out of nowhere and appears simply awkward. Overally, the book does not deliver compared to the hype"
20370,-1,The autobiography of my mother,It's not a book I'll ever read again. It was very boring. Glad I didn't pay that much. I give it a star.
20382,-1,Awful Company. Awful Product. Run! Run! Run!,"Well where do I begin? After a month of use, the battery stopped working. Contacted Canon via email. They replied battery is not under warranty. Would you like to buy another one? Please.6 months later. I started transferring video to my computer only to find out this stupid camera eats tapes. I have lost two tapes so far. One of them was my son's birth!!!!The eating tapes issue is a major problem with this unit. They have known about it and continue to ignore it. Do a search on ""zr40 tape problems"" to see what I am talking about. There are even more results on sister product, zr10. I will never buy a product from Canon again. They are idiots for doing this to their customers."
20405,-1,made my head spin,this made me really dizzy so I had to stop using it after only one use. I ended up tossing it out.
20422,-1,A waste of paper.,"This book is one of many written during the ""Bubble Era"" by ""gaijin"" (primarily Americans) who really knew next to nothing about Japan, yet somehow found a publisher, usually Japanese. Another of this quickie genre published about the same time was a book for teaching profanity to Japanese studying English.""Learning to Bow"" may by an accurate account of the author's experience living in Japan and teaching in the JET program. However, that's all it is. It's full of cliches, sweeping generalizations, and offers no insight into living in Japan or understanding the culture. What could the writer possibly know after only two years?"
20427,-1,Is This A Movie?,"I didn't too sure about this. It was on special movie channel so I gave it a listen. All that happened were people in not many clothes (was the movie at the Beach??) looking sad most times. Also there was a hat. While I watched all I kept thinking was about other things like drinking water that were more exciting. I notice near the ending that the man in the movie was the angry man from the gangrene movie - I almost lost him because he was so different! In the other movie he was mean; here he was just bored or looked like he was looking at something very far aways. He didn't talk much but was a doctor so I guess he is smart. There is a car crash in the snow near the end, but I don't think that was a learning part. The movie is like watching the home films from vacations when you are at boring cousin house, or shows on the public channels. Drink water for more fun - or watch with pillows!!! One sleepy star this time! (wait: there are pretty girls in here, so be careful watching!)"
20428,-1,Please read Kundera's book instead,"Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing (hoping that Daniel Day-Lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from Kundera's book). But I was sorely disappointed.But please read Kundera's novel, because it is wonderful. I can't help but think that Kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: ""The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential."""
20429,-1,One Great Big Sleeper,"I am sorry, but I just can't agree with the reviewers who praise this piece of work. It was so boring that I had it running while I did other things around the house (that was after I actually watched the first 80 minutes). I guess I just don't relate to guys who are constantly ""bedding"" every girl that walks past them. Where is the art? The depth? The complexity? Sorry, it was lost on me. I totally agree with the reviewer who said it was about two sad-looking people. I mean the guys is a heel. What happened to being faithfull. Ok, I know its Prague and 1968 and the whole Russian-thing, but come on - the historical backdrop was handled way too superficially. Where is the depth? Lewis is a fine actor, but the material is not the most exciting or throught-provoking. There, I've shot my wad and now I am gonna list the movie for sale for someone who can appreciate it more than me. Bye."
20434,-1,For Simple Minds,I bought this book because of the reviews and am shocked at how one can become an author by simply stealing life experiences and stories from other peoples lives. I felt the book was shallow and was perfect for people who couldn't think for themselves. Any human being with half a brain can see through the empty content of this book.
20436,-1,Boring,"I bought this book thinking that I would learn something or at least be given food for thought. What I got is a bad travelogue full of inane information about restaurants where the author ate, people he met, what he wore. There is nothing there for a serious or even amateur scholar. Just junk."
20437,-1,Shallow,"I found Dharma Bums suprising. I thought On the Road was one of the most rambling, self-indulgent books that I've ever read, but I realized that Dharma Bums is even more so. The book reminded me how the degeneration of American intellectual life began with the Beats who, at least when they were in the '50's, were self-rightous and shallow, not to mention drunk womanizers, an odd trait for devout Buddhists. This book is a cultural artifact from the Beat era, but not a book to add to one's must-read list. Life is short. Read better."
20442,-1,DIRECTOR's PERSONAL SIGNATURE ......???????????,UPON leaving my 9 year old insised to know EXCATLY what was happening in the bathroom stall?SPOUSE was blank .... I hummed and hawwed .....IS THAT SEQUENCE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED?
20443,-1,you pay less at the theater,Its just thye movie with no special features.I made the mistake of buying it. Had i known i would have never bought it. Avoid wait till the special features come out.
20447,-1,Not even rental worthy,"Ok so I heard that this was better than the last Transformers (didn't see that one), so I thought it must be ok. It's got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, not sure why Shia LaBeouf is an actor...think Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck, but without the charisma. If you are into cartoons,explosions and superficial story telling then it might be palatable for you....otherwise you'd be better off watching the grass grow."
20463,-1,Avoid.. Falsely advertised,Very disappointed with this purchase. I bought this based on product details on Amazon which listed special features and extras - a major reason for my choice. There is only the movie on bluray and DVD. Please correct item details Amazon.
20467,-1,instant video is mislabeling it's movies as 3d,"I did a search for 3d movies on Amazon instant video and this movie came up, but when I purchased it I was disapointed to see that it wasn't 3d. I am writing this review without watching more than 5 minutes of the movie so it's not that the movie is bad. Amazon needs to re-label their 3d movie selection."
20478,-1,Same as Avatar - No 3D or special feets!!!!!!! Booooo!,"Booooo!Don't buy it because no special features are available but there will by by years end, so another clever studio scheme capitolizing on consumers! Yes, they probably factored per 1 million copies sold - 10 - 60 % will double dip generating a flow revenue for the impatient and believe me 90% of americans are IMPATIENT, so they know they have the rabbit by it's tail! Don't take the blue or red pill on this one!!! No rabbit holes running deep here, just peoples pockets that are succorred into buying the bare-boned Optimus...I hope this truly helps you out, seriously.."
20479,-1,Don't buy this movie,"I am glad I watched someone else's movie before I spent money on this lousy thing. I will always be on my do not buy list. Rose what's her name is not worth seeing in the movie. It would have been better without her all together. And she didn't hold a candle to Megan Fox. I did like the FIRST TWO movies but this one is a total waste. Boring from the word go other than some things about Kennedy and the early space program. It would have been better as a cartoon. If they come out with another one, I will not be spending any money on it. This one was so boring during the middle of it I about fell asleep.I would not waste the money on it, just borrow someone else's movie and save your money for a good movie.Oh and I might give it a 2.5/10 but since this is on a 5 scale it only gets a 1 and I would have given the other 2 movies a 4/5."
20480,-1,"The movie itself is ok, the streaming for it was crap.","The movie wouldn't play steadily. I had to watch this on Netflix later.An error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasn't fast enough to play the movie.My internet connection was fine. I had watched movies before and after, and when I checked online with Amazon's customer service page, I more than all the minimum requirements.This is the first time I've had problems streaming with Amazon, but it was awful. Every 10-15, the movie would stop and pop up the error message. I tried restarting the app, restarting my PS3, and no luck."
20484,-1,Terrible movie with good special effects,"The plot was terrible. The acting was terrible. The effects were as good as the other ones. If you want to see pure action without any story, then enjoy. Otherwise...it was a complete waste of time."
20493,-1,Terrible,"This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart."
20497,-1,bad usb connection on P1000,"I really liked this printer when I first got it about 3 years ago. Sure it was loud and a little slow, but it printed pretty good. Well, after about 1 1/2 years of VERY light duty, I all of a sudden start getting error messages on my PC telling me the printer is not connected to the computer. First I changed the cord to no avail, then I tried different open USB ports on my computer, so it ends up I just have to position the USB cable perfectly to the back of the P1000 to get it to work. At least it would still work, right? Well that got me by for about six months and now it just will not connect at all. Now my HP P1000 has a nice new home in the trashcan and I'm giving Canon a try. If HP puts as much thought into printers as they do computers I definetely don't want to buy another HP product again..."
20498,-1,Safety pins,As another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me. I threw them in the trash
20504,-1,Typical action film with strange attempt at humor,"This is a typical action film with lots of fight scenes and gun fights but little logic. It's amazing that hundreds of bullets can be fired at point blank range with no one getting hit and people getting hit in the face with fire extinguishers, pieces of wood and other objects without so much as a scratch. And then there are people surviving incredible explosions, again without getting so much as a hangnail. The directors attempt at moments of humor failed miserably. They were not only not funny but were very wierd to me.I enjoy watching John Cena in action, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger was fun to watch, but this movie just didn't impress me anymore than wrestling does. I think one star out of five was being too generous."
20522,-1,Sony has pulled the plug,"Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website. However, Sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website, and so eMarker devices will now be useless. Don't buy one unless you want a museum piece.For those of us that already own an eMarker, Sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every eMarker returned directly to them."
20535,-1,How Dare They...,"How dare they censor the original?? The Stephen Gammel illustrations were incredible! The art was what made these books great! The writing is still good, but the new drawings are just nowhere near as good as the old ones! Skip this one and buy the old version(s)!!"
20536,-1,Missing what made the original versions great: The art!,"Alvin Schwartz's stories always played second fiddle to Stephen Gammell's art. Without it, this book is not worth anyone's time or money. Avoid it and seek the originals."
20543,-1,This was just a mistake.,"Re-releasing this series with a new illustrator was a terrible idea and, frankly, completely missing the point of the originals. The stories themselves are a collection of sleepover tales and urban legends which, when taken alone, aren't particularly frightening. For those of us who enjoy this series, it was the original illustrations from the twisted mind of Stephen Gammell that made these ""Scary Stories"" truly scary; without them, the book is laughable. Helquist may be a talented enough artist, but he can't hope to duplicate the underlying terror of Gammell's illustrations."
20550,-1,Scary,I have always wanted to bellydance and got this as my first video. It was not at all what I had imagined and quite frankly scared me. Bellydancers were always something mysterious and beautiful and graceful. Atea is awkward to watch and comes off quite bizarre. Not anything to want to imitate and strive to be like.
20552,-1,Unreliable,"Since I have ordered for this product and inspite of the company debiting the total amount for the product from my account, I have not recieved the product till date. The company promises to deliver the product in 12 hrs but its approx more than 3 weeks since the amount was debited but till now, the product hasnt reached me. The company doesnt respond to email queries and its toll free number (the only other point of contact mentioned from their end other than email address) always sounds busy and goes to voicemail."
20554,-1,mediocre,"i didn't care for this cd. it is a Christian goth group that has disappeared and I can see why. not anything special. if you are a collector of christian goth, a friend of the bands, or a fan then get it otherwise don't waste your time."
20558,-1,VERY NARROW,"This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump,i don't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit,they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast"
20561,-1,Shameful,"The author is funded by the big industries which explains the selection of certain topics and the huge bias it reflects. No matter how many good reviews and bibliographic citations appear here, the ideas expressed reflect corporate interests and not scientific knowledge. Always look at the source!! Research very well where this people's funds come from and that will tell you a little bit more about the real issues."
20565,-1,Not worth it!,"This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!"
20571,-1,Can't Believe This Was Even Published,"Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book""."
20572,-1,too small to read,"My rating of one *is not a reflection of the story or the gorgeous illustrations; but, on the unreadable digital version. Shame on the people who will profit from selling something with an unchageable font size that is too small to read. It was obviously scanned in and formatted on landscape view with two hard cover book pages per one narrow digital page. The font and the page size can't be enlarged. I'm really disappointed with Amazon for not only selling something of such inferior quality and even more disappointed with them for highlighting this product as a daily deal. :-("
20575,-1,What a pity,"What a pity that a book about a part of India that has received little attention turns out to be so poorly written. A trip that could have been very interesting to read about is instead a tedious catalogue of ""then we went there and then we did this."" The author comes across as a naive young woman who did not even know to take toilet paper to a remote part of India and patently she (and her travelling companions) had done little (if any) reading about the history and politics of Assam. This is, unfortunately, an unchallenging and uninformative book."
20584,-1,NEVER BUY THIS PRINTER!!,I spent over 2 1/2 hrs. (after 1 hr. myself) on the phone with HP trying to install this printer. It never would work right. The HP tech said there is a problem in the software program of this printer. This HP DESKJET 940C is everyone's worst installation nightmare!
20585,-1,A poor use of my money,"I bought a new laptop and wanted a new printer. This wone came highly recommended from the story. It worked great for three months (of course, the length of the warranty). It now only states ""paper jam"" and after hours of time on the phone and with the hints on the web, I am going out to buy a new printer - I would certainly not buy this one, again."
20590,-1,Waste of time;Stick to Robot novels.,"This book is one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There is very little in the way of plot and character development. There is no climax in this book. The book reads like a historical record, similar to Tolkiens Silmarillion, rather than an actual story. If you like reading historical records, you may like this book. If you are looking for an exciting novel.... better luck elsewhere."
20591,-1,zzzzzz.....,"I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then, by all means, buy this book."
20595,-1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.....Is it over yet?,Count me with the minority who found this book unreadable. It was incredibly dated with imagery very thin and sparse. I got lost in the pointless dialog and was unable to finish.
20602,-1,Do not buy this HP 960 printer from ANTonline,"This ANTONLINE site has falsely advertized this HP Deskjet 960Cse Color printer on Amazon. After paying the advertized price of $61.97 plus $22.82 shipping and handling charge, they sent and delivered you a 6 oz size bubble wrapped pack Innovera Solid ink sticks/cartridge.No invoice or phone number in the package!"
20603,-1,DULLSVILLE,"I saw his film when it was originally released. Robert Altman maybe have been one of the world's greatest directors,but COLD DAY was a low in his career.Sandy Dennis was brilliant as always but the ultra slow and moody film seems to go on forever.Seeing it on video years later again did nothing for me.Sometimes you like films better the second time around but not so for me in this case.It was no wonder that the film was largly forgotten shortly after its original release."
20609,-1,Stay Away,This just plain bad. Boring..... I did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting. It was a waste of my time.
20624,-1,JACK THE IDJIT,I think Three's Company is the WORST sitcom there EVER was on telivision. Bad writing BAD acting and JUST PLAIN BAD all the way around. The horrible thing was it was SO bad you sometimes felt compelled to watch it in spite of your better judgement. PAINFULLY stupid plots.
20631,-1,Horrible...,"I used this camera for a year untill during a period of a couple weeks of not being turned on, something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned. I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one."
20638,-1,Out of date: fading fast,"When written, this books topic was well known. Individuals and styles of communication were well understood.With time, the people and places Con Price refers to are only familiar to a few local individuals-and only important in regards to this fund of knowledge.I am currently working with Dr. William Thackery of MSU-Northern, Havre, Montana to upgrade and update the book and subscript the text for improved reading, relevance, and accuracy.

20647,-1,Red only when off.,"I replaced the amber bulbs of the turn signals with these ones. My car has clear lenses and unfortunately these bulbs are so bright that they look reddish, like washed off, they don't have enough red coating to look RED.I was looking for something to look the same color as the stop lights, these bulbs don't do it."
20648,-1,Barely red enough,"Sold as red, obviously.But I find them to be more pink than dark red. I'm sure they're still legal (or hope they are), but not the look I was hoping for / expecting.Otherwise, they work fine."
20649,-1,The childhood of a legendary king,"The Childhood of a Legendary KingThe tale of King Arthur's youth is an enthralling one. The Sword in the Stone explains King Arthur's youth throughout the book. His name is Wart in the book> From the adventures he takes with the other legends and queens to the learning experiences he has as animals, you won't want to put it down.What makes this book unique is Warts learning experience. He changes into four animals and he turns invisible by Merlin, Warts tutor. The adventures he goes on are amazing. He goes to a giants castle and goes to Morgan le Fay's castle to rescue Friar Tuck. Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book. The reason is that he changes into different animals, turns invisible, and fights monsters. It is for readers 13+."
20653,-1,"wow, what a mess","If you read the Beats and about the Beats, you're eventually going to come to William S. Burroughs. He's very much a voice of the 1950s, post World War II. He was into the drugs, longer and harder and deeper than anyone else. He was into shocking the squares and living off the pathetic working class zombies. And it's all there on the page, man. A strong, unique voice that is still imitated decades later.Unfortunately for those of us living in the twenty-FIRST century, it's about as relevant as fins on cars. It's convoluted, drug paranoia with a created mythology about time and space travel that's all about shocking images of sex and death. It's not a story."
20665,-1,Have not received my item in a month.,"My order was placed on August 28, but I have not received the printer in a month."
20674,-1,Huge disappointment,"I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first. It's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it's now unuseable. Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now ""popped"" so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal. There's no reason this should've happened. When only 1 seam popped it was still ok, but with 2 gone we have to throw it away."
20688,-1,Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop,"We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is ""save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on"", that's what we're doing now."
20702,-1,not reccomended,"Would not purchase this item again. Used in spare bedroom for guests. Hardly used, until now. Hoping top have Xmas guests use. First to lay on it, and center ring pooped.Still usable, but uncomfortable. The second night used bed hissing sound and a large leak appeared. They provide plastic to repair leaks, but do not provide any adhesive. I have to eat it now because I had until 11/12/12 to return.I can get partial credit, not including shipping if I just had just kept the box and shipping label for 3 months."
20706,-1,Help!,"Hello everybody! I ordered this product but the first one that i received didn't work, and now i have the second one and it still doesn't work. It might sound weird, but i put batteries in it and it doesn't start working. What should i do? Thanks!"
20711,-1,So Disappointing!,"I was so excited to try this item when I ordered it, but when I got it I was so disappointed because it didn't work. It didn't even turn on! I didn't try to return it because I was under the impression it is a nonreturnable item. I won't order this product again but will try ordering from Amazon again."
20712,-1,Disappointed again,Had a very toxic smell and probably will be toxic if used. No matter how much it was cleaned it still had a very strong smell. Scared to use it because of its smell. The ears and shaft are very hard and not flexible at all. It will be tossed in the trash. Another waste of money.
20714,-1,Great Transaction!!!,"Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP. 110% satisfied with their service..,"
20716,-1,California Exotics jack rabbit,Piece of crap. All functions did not work when opened and stopped working during first use... horrible product. California Exotics should be ashamed of selling this junk. do not waste your money or shipping..
20717,-1,Not worth the money,"What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews, but when I tried it, it did nothing. First, it is very heavy and hard to hold (if you are using it by yourself). Second, it hurts your clitoris. It is very sharp on the ears, that's the part that goes on you clit. I'm almost temped to cut them off. Third and forth, it smells and it is very loud.I've tried it about 4 times, trying to get used to it. My husband has tried to use it on me too. No luck at all. This is not worth the money."
20720,-1,Yet another disappointed customer,"Add me to the list of folks who received a vibrator-shaped paperweight instead of an actual vibrator. I tried two sets of batteries just to make sure, but it was dead. Also, as others have mentioned, the toxic plastic smell was over-powering, so I was a little bit glad it didn't work or I might have been tempted to try it and I may never have gotten that smell out of me. :o)Amazon, understandably, doesn't allow returns on vibrators, but the paperwork for a refund was done in under an hour and I should get it in a few days, so at least that part was easily done."
20734,-1,"Like the sprial binding, not much else","The spiral binding on this book is it's only positive.I haven't found a single thing in this book I would like to stitch. The graphs are done with colored Xs which make it difficult to distinguish between similar colors, and to imagine what the finished product will look like. The colors are not given in Anchor or DMC format, but in other numbers that you then have to look up the DMC or Anchor numbers in the back. Finally there are very few designs for each category. For example, there are only about four or five small pages of Christmas designs. Christmas is a very large subject to design from. Did they run out of ideas? Rather than this book, buy the Better Homes and Gardens 2000 Cross Stitch Designs. There are so many more designs for many more topics, and stitched pictures are given so you know what you'll be working on."
20738,-1,dont bother with XP,"I Have had trouble with HP and XP since upgrading. Although they say it is xp compatable with driver, it is not. Will cause system to lock up and when I called HP they blamed XP. Bought a Epson and first time install without a hitch. Hope this helps and God bless you!"
20739,-1,Spare us,"I purchased this CD for my wife for Mother's Day. After listening to it, it became very clear that Babs is way out of her league when she sings with singers the caliber of Il Divo (whom she refers to as ""swell"" by the way. Swell???). The continual platitudes such as ""children are like sponges"" etc. are boring. At 65 years of age she can at least try to come up with something new to say. As for her political persuasion, who cares!"
20742,-1,misleading cd,This is not Lighthouse. This is the ST Luke UMC Lighthouse Praise Band. I am returning it to Amazon because it looks like Chrstian filler.
20746,-1,Don't waste your money,"This watchtower was never used by the manufacturer because the unit itself comes with 3 legs that could likely hold one pound of weight and this weighs several. The ""legs"" don't even lock in place, they just sit in groves so the minute you place the weight on it they collapse over and over. If you manage to get it to stand the minute your child touches it it will fall over. Otherwise it would have been a wonderful toy. It looks like the show and the body is sturdy and well put together. Too well put together to be supported by the legs provided. Don't buy it, if your child is younger talk them into the Spiderman playset, much more sturdy."
20747,-1,A PIECE OF JUNK!,"Do not buy this toy - it has been a source of frustration and disappointment for all 3 of my children. Difficult to put together (and I have assembled my share of kid's toys), it will not stay together at all. It is challenging (at best) to get the figures in the elevator, and none of the figures with capes will fit - they tend to get stuck halfway up. The elevator also requires the child to turn a little wheel to get it to go up - too difficult for little ones. It requires a degree in engineering to get the little plane to fold up inside the watchtower - very poor and frustrating design. The noises are also weak as are the features (i.e. the trip wire, rockets, the plane). Just a complete waste of money - it is only a couple of weeks old, and it is headed to the trash."
20748,-1,Not for children to PLAY with!,"This item is not meant for children to play with! Strange, since it has to do with action figures of Super Heroes! But honestly, if your child does more than set this on a shelf, you'll soon be hearing screams of frustration. The elevator won't work! (ours completely stopped working in 2 days); The guns on the top keep falling off!; The whole thing just falls apart. No, this item is for the collector and I think Mattel KNEW that. They figured the few that were opened and did not work offset all the ones that would remain MIB or NRFB for collectors.This item is just like Mattel's HOT WHEELS JUNKIE SETS. Another sore point with parents. Hot Wheels cars are fine, but those sets that Mattel makes NEVER work as promised. And what's with the instructions that have little to no writing on them??! Some of the drawings are impossible to figure out. In Mattel's case, a word is worth a thousand illustrations!"
20758,-1,stupid student review by gabriel c,Romeo and Juliet is a story about to lovers that meet at first sight. The biggest problem they have together is that both of the families have been fighting and hate each other since they both have been born. It all started when Romeo been depressed ever day moping around and feeling sad all of the time because he loved Rosaline and she did not love him back. So one day Romeos cousin told him about this party and that Rosaline would be there so they left and Romeo saw Juliet there and followed her to her house and both exchanged thoughts about each other and decided that they will get married but secretly. So they had to come up with a plan to pretend that Juliet was died so the can get married and the planned failed and they both ended up killing themselves. Play was very stupid it sucks no one should read it because there is no point of reading this because all this play is taking up your time.
20762,-1,Good book -- but not this edition,"This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It's great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version."
20770,-1,Wish I could Order this Item,"I could really use this Item but I won't order it if I cannot order the color that I want; guess I'll have to look elsewhere.....sorry, this company seems to be losing a lot of sales with the 'let us choose for you' policy."
20779,-1,Harmful self esteem advice for 10% of the population,"Avoid this book on the basis a dated and harmful passage on page 144 that states that homosexuality is ""related to a failure in identification"" and that parents of homosexual children should ""seek professional help at the earliest possible moment"". Their view of the cause of homosexuality is out of mainstream thought, and it implies that something wrong happened. The main reason for need for any counseling would be if homosexuality is causing adjustment or self-acceptance problems. This is not what the author's have in mind. Following the author's advice fails to honor your childs true nature, and certainly would be detrimental to the development of his/her self esteem."
20781,-1,Fabrication... Squeezing the cash out of MAC...,"I've communicated with Charlie on more than one occasion.The man does not write nor talk like this book reads.End of story.However, his written word is legible, unlike what someone wrote in their review, some of it is a little hard to read because he's about 71 years old now and I would imagine his hands tremble a bit...But about this book...Waste of money.The ReVeReNd"
20804,-1,Don't Buy The Batcave,My 4 year old son received the Batcave for Christmas. I know it is about $40. It took my hubby 1/2 hour to put together - is EXTREMELY flimsy & my son got batman stuck in the bat elevator within the first 2 minutes of using it. Soooooo not worth it. What a let down.
20805,-1,Unacceptable,"The Eurorack was purchased as a portable mixer to tie mics into a camera. The inherent noise in my particular mixer is completely unacceptable. At a very reasonable level using balanced connections the mixer unmistakably colors the sound with a clear sounding ""HISS"". Even when running on batteries and far away from any electronic device the HISS is incredibly loud! Totally unacceptable for my purpose. The unit is now stashed away in a closet, a washed up waste of time!However for those on a budget who desire much greater quality with fewer inputs I HIGHLY recommend a Mackie 402-VLZ3 Four-Channel Compact Audio Mixer. However sometimes fewer inputs are unacceptable. Whatever the case steer clear from behringer!"
20806,-1,Save yourself the trouble,"I'm pretty tech savy, and This is by far the worst experience ive had with ANY piece of electronica ever. Dont let the low price fool you, theres a reason for that. The drivers are terrible for this, Uninstalling this scanner requires 4 different programs, tech support charges you money for help (even though I bought this 2 weeks ago), and if you actually get the scanner to work it will take a good 25 minutes to get the 1200 dpi resolution scan. Also the software it comes bundled with (Scansoft Paperport) is horrible, i have 2 gbs of Ram and it ran as if i had 128 mb. the TWAIN compatibility is awful, and it isnt compatible with any third party software. I wish there was something good I could write about this scanner, Aftr 2 weeks I got fed up, returned the scanner and bought an HP. People please do not hurt yourself by buying this awful piece of junk."
20812,-1,A waste of time,"This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like ""Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are."" The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of ""What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores."" What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs."
20817,-1,Very Frustrating Piece of Office Equipment,I have had the displeasure of working with this machine for over 4 years. Its incompetent feeder is only matched by the uselessness of the software it comes with. Save yourself the frustration and buy another scanner.
20825,-1,A Possible Discontinued Item?,"What's going on Creative Labs? Is it a coincidence that I no longer can get any of your Nomad Zen Xtras (worst name ever) at Best Buy and now the 60GB Nomad Xtra is ""sold out"" or more likely ""discontinued"" at the almighty Amazon.com? hmmmmm...."
20835,-1,DON'T BUY THIS ONE!,"I purchased this product just a few months ago and it's broken already. It was used at a desk with ear phones so it wasn't moved,bounced or anything you would expect a personal player to withstand.It skipped at the slightest bump and went through batteries like crazy.I now have a different CD player and would not recommend this to anyone."
20838,-1,OUTDATED,"1)The problems in the book are very outdated. (for grammar section buy Cliff's or Longman)2)The problems in the book are less difficult than those on a real exam.3)The problems in the book were arranged in very boring manner.4)The CD-Rom is only for Listening. (for more computer practice buy Delta's Key for Toefl Test with CD, which has 10 tests or Cambridge Preparation for Toefl Test, which has 7 tests. Both books have CD-Rom simulated CBT.)5) The Essay section is fair. (for the best essay section buy Cambridge Preparation for the Toefl Test)Generally, there is no one book for the preparation for the TOEFL. Most likely you will need some combination of them.For instance,a) Delta for practice and reading. Moreover, you may wish to buy just Delta CD Rom without book and cassets for practice only;b)Cliff's or Longman for grammar;c)Cambridge for essay and for practice.Good luck!"
20840,-1,Hardly worth reading,"This book, while fairly well written, was quite a dull story, and was very depressing to read. Sherwood seems to have researched her subject well, but the book seemed to be unnecessarily vulgar in a number of places, and this made the book all the more unpleasant to read."
20842,-1,Pile of Junk - Save your money!,"The first one I received the SD card slot lock did not work. The second one literally took 5 to 10 minutes to boot up. I returned it again to Discount Jungle (Amazon Seller) and they said they would not charge me the 15% restocking fee which they did anyhow.All in all, I wouldn't own another Sandisk MP3 even if they would give me one for free! I'm out $10.00 for two return shipments and another $10.00 restocking fee. Nothing to restock at Discount Jungle, send the piece of junk back to Sandisk!!!Save some headaches and buy something different! Do a Google search for Sansa View slow start up, boot, or lockup.At least the FM Radio was nice....that's why it has a two star rating. I'd sure hate to see how well the re-manufactured units work."
20849,-1,SanDisk MP3 Player,"Player was defective. After charging battery, I turn it on and while attempting to download an audio-book, the unit ""locked up"", All functions ceased, and I couldn't turn it off: back of player became very warm. Battery finally lost life and the unit shut down. One unsuccessful attempt was was made to recharge it. It was returned for refund.."
20854,-1,This device is the worst ever,if its not tranferring the wrong music... its freezing up.. or not liecening properly.. or the device itself sticks(dail to select with). this is my third sansa and will be my last
20855,-1,De la poudre aux yeux,"J'ai acheté un Sansa View 16gB pour $200 CAD il y a deux ans et demie à peine, et la batterie vient de mourrir. L'estimation pour la réparation et le remplecement de la batteire est de $80 minimum, vous voyez le topo? Malgré son excellente sonorité, je ne recommande pas cet appareil, difficile à comprendre, parfois il gèle... à éviter!"
20856,-1,Frustrating,"Any problem listed in previous reviews, I encountered with mine. At which point I discovered one more weakness of this mp3 player.It does not fare well against a hammer."
20858,-1,Poor Qiality Control,"Despite the many reviews from folks who had to return one or more Sansa Views before getting a functional one, I figured the manufacturer must have cleared up their quality problems to stay in the market. Wrong!!!!My brand new Sansa View 8 totally stopped functioning about 20 minutes into its first use. I'm very disappointed to have waited for my order to be filled and now must wait again for a replacement. I'm more than a month into my purchase and I have nothing to show for it but a paid bill.Amazon has not stepped up at all, either. The order was filled by a vendor whom I've never heard of before. Amazon refers buyers to that vendor's customer service and takes no part in satisfying the purchaser.Lots of room for improvement on the part of all three providers."
20863,-1,Fragile,"This is a cute little gadget, but it got broken after only three months of carrying it in my pocket. Seems to be too fragile for being a mobile player."
20871,-1,Advertising,"It is one brand name after another, don't waste your money.<br />This book has more fluff then recipes that you can use everyday, plus it will not save you money with all the package and can food you have to search out and buy."
20881,-1,Watch the price,I bought this from the same co. before christmas and was stunned that the price had doubled. On the page the price was not clear!
20889,-1,Worthless,None of the gels came close to fitting in my ear - I ended up using the little rubber ring in the kit on my Jabra bluetooth to keep it from slipping out. Highly not recommended...
20895,-1,"Thanks for nothing, Jabra","Jabra directed me to these as a replacement for the lost pieces for my Wave. THESE ARE NOT what I need. Meh. Gonna be two more weeks before I get home to return them.I don't blame the merchant, blame Jabra for directing me to waste weeks buying, waiting for, and returning the wrong stuff. Swedish morons"
20900,-1,WOW,"Watching this movie after having read the book is pretty much hell. The fact that they changed the whole plot from the book makes it seem like a joke. Then the ""special effects"" just made it even worse. Even if you haven't read the book and you don't know the real story, the movie was still horribly directed and filmed. There are no transitions, and the actors don't seem to realize they are all in one movie together. They all have their own accents and the only thing they have in common with the characters they are playing from the book is their names. The only reason anyone should ever watch this movie is out of complete boredom and a need to make fun of something."
20914,-1,RE: Wipeout originally by Surfaris,"Google the instrumental Wipeout , and you will read the real story. I love the Surfari's version which got to #2 on the Billboard charts in a matter of weeks."
20915,-1,A pitiful excuse for a movie,"If you want to see a movie of Moby Dick, see the John Huston directed version, with screenplay by Ray Bradbury. This pitiful excuse for a movie was made by people who had no knowledge of New England, whaling, whales, or Herman Melville's epic novel. The grand poetry, the vivid imagery, the theological symbolism which fill ""Moby Dick"" are all missing in this shell of a film. Even Stewart's performance is a disappointment--Khan in Star Trek II does a better job of spouting Ahab's venom than Stewart's anemic portrayal.The additions to the story are meaningless (Chinese harpooners, Queequeg's ""BLAH!"" noises,Ahab's family)...and the omissions are puzzling (Elijah).And the rubber whale--who is unscarred, unmarked by corkscrew harpoons, ungrizzled, unbarnacled, with no flight of gulls--well, he looks like a rubber whale."
20916,-1,TERRIBLE MOVIE,"What a waste of 2 hours. Nothing gets accomplished at all! You watch some terrible graphics, watch everyone die, and they didn't even kill the freaking WHALE!That made me mad.This film accomplishes nothing.There is no point at all to this movie.Don't waste your time, money, and energy.Leave, quickly!"
20918,-1,Ordered this item 3 weeks ago still waiting....,"The description said usually ships in 1-2 business days, well it's been 1 month and I have another month to go until I recieve this item. Don't believe the descriptions! I ordered this 3 weeks ago now the delivery estimate is the end of November. If you are cold and need this item this year don't buy it from Amazon. It probably won't arrive until February! It's going to take 2 months for delivery! Just a warning!"
20921,-1,"Van Damme gives the best performance,","which does not bode well for the movie. The other actors are just so horrible and the story so flat. Don't get me wrong, I like Jean-Claude, movies like Timecop and Bloodsport were pretty good for what they were. The fighting scenes in Black Eagle just don't make up for a lame movie though."
20923,-1,Seems every time Van Damme plays a bad guy he does his mute method acting,Black Eagle was released a few months after Van Damme became a star with Bloodsport. The film could have made Van Damme a wash up but luckily it didn't. The martial arts chorography in the film is very sloppy and the fight scene between Sho Khogusi and Van Damme is weak. Skip this one
20926,-1,A charismatic Lutheran who's more charismatic than Lutheran,"This work is an enthusiastic encouragement and guidebook for charismatic renewal among Lutherans. However, it offers some dangerous theology. For example, it suggests that it's okay to make mistakes when first trying to prophesy--that everybody needs practice. However, this is contrary to Scripture. God takes false prophecy very seriously, but unfortunately Mr. Christenson does not."
20930,-1,CHEESY! And I don't mean Parmigiano-Reggiano!,"As a previous reviewer said, it pulled out every single American cliche about Italy in the book, which is pretty much what I had expected. But oh my GAWD was this awful! I was laughing hysterically at this. As bad as a low budget miniseries."
20932,-1,very much disappointed,"It was just terrible for me, living in Italy for many years now. I hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of Italian men. it seemed to me a real bad Hollywood interpretation of A Room with A View."
20942,-1,wrong formAt,I may have read the description wong but the DVD won't play. States wrong source. In small letters on the box it says it's the UK version. Can't fiind by receipt so I can't return it. I was really looking forward to sharing it with someone special. :(
20944,-1,Non vero Italia!,"This not a window into Italy, but rather an American contrivance of Italy. Cliches abound. Comedy forced. I have disowned all who claim to even mildly enjoy this movie. Questa film e' merda."
20951,-1,Amazon mix-up,"I ordered a Canon camera battery. NB-5L.Some company (not Amazon) sent the wrong battery.I tired to send it back. Too complicated. (Many emails, lots of forms.) I found someone who needed the incorrect battery (NB-4L) and gave it to them.Then I went to a real store and bought the correct battery.Bad taste in my mouth remains."
20954,-1,A Confusing Waste of Plastic,"The movie has a vague plot, meaningless items, (like the facial tattoo), and a loud, annoying soundtrack which frequently overwhelms the dialog. The additional injection of non-english conversations, which it only translated occasionally, simply adds to the confusion. No real resemblence to either the novel or the original movie. I'd find 90 minutes of the Shopping Channel more entertaining."
20956,-1,Why? Oh Why? This is just an outrage.,"The temptation to re-make movies is evidence of the fact that there is little creativity in Hollywood. This movie is evidence that there are people in Hollywood who should not be allowed to go to movies let alone make them.The original is not all that great, but it was in fact original and had some very interesting photography and stunts. This version is insipid to the point of stupidity; the photography stinks, and the stunts are mostly cut-and-paste special effects.The people who made this should be banned from any association to movie making for life! So why did I buy it? By mistake! I had a copy of the original and thought a comparison would be interesting. I was wrong. Learn from my error and avoid this like the very plague."
20958,-1,travesty remake on bluray? original not even on anamorphic dvd?,"The old saying hollywood never lost money underestimating the intelligence of the american people really hits you in the groin with this head shaker of a release.While the orignal classic rollerball hasn't even gotten an anamorphic dvd release, let alone a blu-ray!"
20969,-1,The pits,"A complete waste of film start to finish.Don't waste your money.If you must see it for yourself, rent it.This movie didn't need a remake, the original starring James Caan was just fine.One star is generous."
20975,-1,DISAPPOINTED,I was extremely disappointed with the fabric and color when it came. It is obvious that it is of poor quality but I guess you get what you paid for 10 bucks.The zipper of the plastic cover of one set was broken.I bought 2 queen sheets and I wanted to return both purchases if only I did not have to pay for shipping.Do not buy this!!!! You will regret it.
20976,-1,i got it cheap and it is Cheap !!!,"I did not like the product, but i got it really cheap . This is not a quality product , avoid at higher prices"
20978,-1,This toy is the WORST!,"This toy is the worst! You can't even get past the Password screen to play anything. I got tricked that it was a good toy, but it's not. And I don't want you to get tricked, either. I thought it was a good toy by looking at it in the wrapper, but it wasn't."
20979,-1,I hate useless products,"You have to buy most of the battle chips seperatly which leeches your cash in no time, don't bother. Get a Game Boy or a Nintendo DS if you want handheld fun."
20984,-1,Why do people like this garbage?,"Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking. My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious. I, however, am left wondering: why?I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors. The characters are boring and flat. His humor is downright stupid. This book is not clever in the least. If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel. But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand."
20985,-1,The worst mess ever,"DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! This was delivered in three boxes and was bound by plastic wrap. Once out of the box, the three layers were cut with what looked like pinking shears and were horribly uneven. This was NEVER a mattress that sold for 999.00 ... When I tried to return it All Sleep was helpful at first but I could not package the layers to send. While trying to come up with a solution to the shipping problem, the UPS labels they sent to me expired and now they will not return any emails or calls. WORST SERVICE AND PRODUCT EVER!"
20990,-1,Where's the storyline,"This is beautifully written but this does not make up for the total absence of a story. Three characters in war and how their lives, interact. Reads like a series of notes rather than a completed work. If it is trying to convey the horror of war it fails. Deeply deeply disappointing - I feel I have wasted my time and been cheated."

21031,-1,I bought this as a Christmas present!,"Now my daughter will not stop aggravating me because we cannot download the pictures off of the dran thing and wants a new camera, so now, I have not only wasted my money, but I have to buy her a more expensive camera that will work that she will break or lose.Thanks so much Vivitar!"
21033,-1,Amazon.com sent wrong size,Amazon.com sent the wrong size engine oil cooler than what I ordered. Rather than sending it back I made due but it didn't work out like I wanted it to because the cooler was wider than what I originally ordered.
21035,-1,Do not waste your money!!,"This DVD will not load in your player. You will get a message, ""this cannot be played, not a compatible format"". Hopefully Amazon.com will allow me to return this DVD. This was a bad purchase for me."
21045,-1,Further proof that stupidity comes in all colors.,"Firstly, I find it startling that Vintage would deign to publish something so poorly written. The semi-literacy of this prose (I'm being generous) does, if nothing else, suggest that Miss Souljah didn't use a ghost writer. The words, in all their ghettofied glory, are hers. Booker T. Washington would have wept. While I can appreciate to some extent this woman's pathological disgust of whites, I cannot understand the roots of her homophobia or anti-Semitism. Her easy-way-out philosophy (Everybody's to Blame Except Me) is the very thing that keeps her where she is."
21047,-1,Sci-Fi Natural Law,"Here is a recent example of this author's online reasoning, which he proposes others should be governed by in a free republic:""Let us assume that two planets which have not yet been inhabited by humans are to be colonized by them; on Planet Alpha, heterosexual couples only are assigned; on Planet Beta, only homosexual couples. In one hundred years, will both islands be populated assuming that reproductive technologies are not available to either group? I suggest that Planet Alpha will be; but Planet Beta will not. Why? The basic answer is to be found in the biological complementarity of the heterosexual couple necessary for procreation that is absent in same-sex couple. This is a scientific argument...""As I suspected, Natural Law theorists are about as serious as Trekkies"
21054,-1,Utterly unwatchable - nonstop grating attempts at standup comedy,Incredibly inefficient information delivery. My wife and I tried desperately to watch it but just could not stomach it despite occasional useful bits. Incessant terrible affected attempts at humor and impersonations. Very old video. Pure torture.
21067,-1,I don't get it,"Why does everyone rave about this? One of the reviews even says, ""If you need this then get it."" Yeah, if you're travelling you need this, but more importantly why can't Apple just sell the different adapaters individually? Apple must assume that a lot of people have more than one of their products - perhaps a macbook and an ipod, so wouldn't it make more sense to sell the adapters individually, that way one could buy for example two European adapaters, one for ipod and one for macbook? Another apple rip-off if you ask me."
21069,-1,Too Much Info,This book should have been written more as a novel than a how to. This book goes into story like dimensions and there are others better written on the subject.
21071,-1,Whoops! Product description does not mention it is incomplete,"I love this novel and ordered it for my mom. The price was high enough [exorbitant] for a paperbound book that I thought that the novel would be complete. The product description says NOTHING about it being one volume of a complex work. It is one volume, not the complete work, I was embarrassed to discover from my mom. Where is the rest of the work? NOT AVAILABLE? Available for an additional [exorbitant] sum? If it had been an order for myself, I would return, but my mom is 3,000 miles away and I do not want to add insult to injury by asking her to pack and return ship, so injustice has been rewarded."
21074,-1,This book is AWEFUL,"I read this book 3-4 years ago. It's still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it. You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE! That should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere. Not Recommended."
21075,-1,Amature.,"I'm a reader. I am not a writer, but if I had the writing skills of Jean Auel, my review of Clan of the Cave Bear might look like this:""I eagerly awaited the rare opportunity to read the famous book by Jean Auel. As I anxiously read the exciting words on the white pages, I was constantly distracted by the desparate use of poorly-chosen adjectives. After reading two large paragraphs, I could easily tell that the large book was poorly written by a hopelessly unskilled amature.""Jean Auel had some great ideas for a story, but does not have the skills to tell it. The story might be interesting and well researched, but it is difficult to get past her awful prose which does nothing to paint a picture of a prehistoric time, and her amature use of adjectives is forever distracting from the story she's trying to tell.Please read the sample pages before buying this book. This is not a book for anyone who enjoys good writing."
21078,-1,"I Know I'm in the Minority Here, But...","I'm so sorry to be such a spoilsport, but I found this is a terrible book and a worse series. Leaving aside all the wild inaccuracies - one of the main ones being Auel's portrayal of Neandertals as doltish brutes -the heroine is constantly making one earthshaking discovery after another - shampoo, domestication of animals, law of genetics, sex=pregnancy, and, last but not least, tampax. No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another. I'm sure in one of the later books she will be found making a short-wave radio out of a large rock. It became really maddening."
21089,-1,"RIP OFF, STOLEN WORKS","Don't waste your hard earned money on this. Instead buy the REAL thing, ""Let There Be Light"", by Darius Dinshah. Nothing else to say. Rip Off of Darius Dinshah's father's works!!!!!!!"

21097,-1,Only works with Microsoft e-mail clients,"If you are security minded and choose to use an e-mail client like Thunderbird or the bundled Opera e-mail client this program will NOT protect you! Not only that, but the fact that CA Anti-virus will ONLY work with MS Outlook or Outlook Express is not revealed in any documentation. I found this out the hard way when a manual scan found a virus in my Opera mail folder and couldn't clean or quarantine it! The CA tech confirmed that the AV program only works with MS e-mail clients. To me this is false advertising!!!"
21105,-1,Overpriced,"I cannot believe the ""discounted"" price of $23, when you can buy the identical item from other suppliers on Amazon for just over $3.00 (that's right, $20 less). Search on ""key float""."
21108,-1,Save your money!! A Cheap Stinko!!,"Big disappointment. During the simulated unsexy sex scenes the sound track changes to some awful detached music that kills the mood. The main charactor isn't even that good looking. You want ""HOT STUFF""? Then check out (the unedited or Unrated versions of)Emmanuelle, Emmanuelle 2, Dessert Hearts (the hottest lesbian scene ever made), Butterflies Are Free, Tender Cousins (the french language version), Carried Away, Lured Innocence. That's the ""A"" list of erotica. Warning don't view more than one of these at a time, they'll melt your VCR."
21109,-1,What a waste,"I had the movie before, but when I saw that the collectors addition had the ""Flyboys Game"" I thought I would buy it off the market place. Good seller, but the DVD did not come with the game as advertised. It only came with a DEMO version of the game. They should have said that on the box. Thanks a bunch for false advertisement. Thought the other extras might make up for it, WRONG! Don't waste your time or money."
21113,-1,Is There A Cliche That Wasn't Used?,"This absolutely idiotic excuse for a movie actually got enjoyable after a while, simply because my viewing companions and I began a game of ""Guess Which Cliche Is Going To Be Used Next"". By the time The Black Baron (whatever... ) got himself shot, a la ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the group was overcome by hysterical - albeit quite rude - comments and laughter.Haven't had that much fun since that stupid movie about the F16 pilot shot down over Bosnia.To think that such bravery, such envelope-pushing, such absolute horror has devolved into a depiction such as this.Jeez-Oh-Man, what'r they gonna do to the Battle of Britain?!?!?!?"
21114,-1,Thank God for fast forward,"I asked the clerk at the video store how they determine the number of videos to buy for rentals. She told me it is based on the box office record of the film. She had 2 Flyboys. One would have been plenty.The story was sappy. The acting just so so. The aerial sequences were much like a video game. Try ""Flight Simulator"". WWI biplanes hanging on their props??? Climbing 90 degrees?? Landing a biplane in shell cratered ""no man's land"" in the heat of battle to save a buddy who has his hand (not his arm, his legs, his torso, but just his hand) trapped under the wing of his crashed plane?? That's realism??There wasn't much believable about this film. A third of the way through the movie I fast forwarded through all scenes except the dogfights. I was hoping for something on the order of ""The Blue Max"". ""Flyboys"" stalled on climb out, went into a flat spin, and augured deep into the depths of movie flops!"
21120,-1,A truly bad movie,Considering the richness of the subject matter and the real life stories of those who lived it this was a truly bad movie. The makers tried to tell everything and as a result told nothing. The characters were unbelieveably superficial and too many of the flying scenes were historically inaccurate and unreal. If a few special effects are good too many are not necessarly better. The Blue Max and Battle of Britain are far far superior. For those who are willing to put up with a mess just to look at recreations of old airplanes its probably worth buying but be prepared for alot of dissapointment if you are looking for a good movie.
21123,-1,Saperstein is a no talent,He has the eye and ear of an advertiser. Quick with the headline but totally lacking in content.A suit devoid of body and soul .
21124,-1,One of the worst movies EVER !!!!,"I don't get it. How can anybody give this miscreation of a film more than 1, maybe 2 stars? I expected to see a funny, original film but instead got to see some of the worst screenwriting ever. The plot is just plain awful.The sets and costumes were beautifully done, the acting wasn't bad, but that's not enough to save this #@%$(* of a film."
21130,-1,If I had one wish...,"Amazon would allow us to vote using negative stars. While we're on the subject of radiation, maybe chemotherapy would be less painful and traumatic then listening to this garbage."

21141,-1,This is the worst hockey game!!,This is the worst hockey game made for this season. This game looks like it was made in the eighties! I rented Hitz and the gave me this by accident. I played it for about twenty minutes and i was so disgusted I didn't touch it again. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone except as a very last resort. After a bout five minutes of playing I had counted three animation glitches and five sound ones. This game was so horrible my family who doesn't know much about games even thought it was horrible. I have been to three rental stores and four different department stores and the highest and the highest anyone gave it was 4/10.
21144,-1,Tiny Tim in Adulthood,"Mr. Timothy: A Novel was disappointing in its lack of cleverness.I always look for tidbits of humor but found nothing much in this ""angry"" immage of Tim as an adult."
21152,-1,"Self aggrandizing psycho-babble,","The book is poorly written with a lot of name dropping and gossipy insinuations. Into Thin Air, Climb, High Exposure are all better written and far more interesting. I think she figures if she refers to the ""mother goddess"" enough times she can pass the book off as feminist treatise. Lucky for Gammelgaard, she's a better climber than writer, or she'd be just be another fossil on the mountain. Don't waste your money."
21169,-1,I Wish I Hadn't,"This book cost me the FRM last year. I made it the center of my study program. The book's writing is atrocious; there are gaps in what is covered; and there are many errors and misstatements. I wasted six weeks struggling with this book. When I finally realized my mistake, it was too late to rescue my study program, and I failed the exam. I am very disillusioned with Jorion and GARP. This shoddy, overpriced paperback makes me think they are in it just for the money. This year, I have signed up for the CFA exam instead. So far, I have been very impressed with their study materials."
21171,-1,I gave it a try...,"Sorry... I gave this album a few spins but I still can't think of a one good thing to say about it. Except maybe that it will probably be the weirdest thing you'll ever hear... can't say it's not original, but in this case that's not necessairly a good thing. If you're not familiar with this band, this probably wouldn't be the best album to start with."
21175,-1,HORRIBLE CAMERA!,"I recently ordered this camera hoping I could fly my helicopter controlling it at close range. Well I sure was wrong! this camera gets fuzzy and you can hardly tell whats going on when it is 10ft away behind my helicopter box. I am very disappointed and hope to warn potential buyers that the range is terrible and can barely broadcast through a window let alone in the room right beside it. Unless you have one big room where the camera and receiver will both be placed, its not worth it. I just am saying It does not have a range near 200 ft like some are saying.. maybe you could tell whats going on at 50 ft no obstructions sitting still, but otherwis I do not recommend this to anyone and I am planning on returning the camera."
21178,-1,"Not as good as Harry Potter, says I","While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax. This book isn't as good as Harry Potter in MY opinion, and no one can refute me. Tastes are relative!"
21188,-1,monotony,"Attempting to read this book is worse than watching the grass grow. At least the grass will become something you enjoy. The title and plotline of the story intrigued me to read it. Don't get me wrong, if well-written, this storyline could be very interesting. But even after just ten pages, the only thought going through my mind was ""When will this guy shut up and tell the story???"" The plot comes in a distant second to the narrator's monotone, seemingly unending monologue. If I could withstand this, I believe I would have enjoyed it. But forgive me for not having that kind of patience for hundreds of pages."
21195,-1,A Real Disappointment,"This fan is a colossal waste of money - it's not worth the shipping cost, much less the purchase price. When the tent got hot, the poor performance of this fan was a real disappointment."

21199,-1,Save your money.,"I am a big fan of foreign movies. When I read read the reviews listed here, I decided to see this movie before buying the DVD. Thank goodness. The storyline was terrible."
21200,-1,one of the worst Cannes winners,"That movie was soooo boring. An old teacher living together with her mum, whom she hates, very blunt loud dialogues between them, why does an independent self supporting lady stay there at all, ridiculous..I was very, very disappointed of actress Huppert's role, it was not her fault, that she had so little to do or say, eg in that scene on the public toilet.E. Jelinek's story was either not transported or is it really so far away from real life, or sex, or even perverse perversion?I did not even try to find out, too much time spent on that already. Sorry."
21202,-1,Pretentious bore,"Ok. So Isabelle Huppert was brave in doing some of the things she does in this. So what?The movie is a pretentious bore which never grabs the viewer. It's just a series of nasty and kinky scenes which ultimately go nowhere. The Isabelle Huppert character is a psychopath, but incredibly she is an uninteresting one.A truly disappointing movie."
21204,-1,A Majority of One DVD-R movie,"If this was a professional DVD, it would not be made on a DVD-R disk. Instead it should be made on a dual layer DVD disk because it is over two hours. This DVD-R disk must therefore be less quality than standard play playback. Not good for High Definition flat screens, especially the larger size screens. By the way, this movie was broadcasted by Turner Classic Movies in letterboxed form. The TCM broadcast movie differed from the movie I had on prerecorded VHS tape. The TCM movie plot was better than what was on the VHS version. Also the TCM version was in widescreen and more sharp than the VHS version. The source of where this DVD version came from which you are selling is NOT provided and that is one more reason why I won't buy it. Sincerely, Rick Gershon.A Majority of One"
21207,-1,It didnt work,I kept getting an error message when trying to install it. I ended up having to return it unfortunately. sorry
21210,-1,it is a joke,"this bottle warmer is just a joke. It takes forever to warm a cold bottle up. I say "" forever"", it is forever. When I checked the power, it is only 13W. If you do the math, you know the energy the warmer produces may take forever to reach the heat to warm a bottle up."
21213,-1,Cannot be used with Playtex Nurser Bottles,I was very disappointed to get this product and find out that it cannot be used with Playtex Nurser bottles.
21221,-1,One of the worst books I've ever read....,"I read the first two chapters of this book, and I have to say that the writing was horrible. I can't believe that I wasted my time reading that much of the book."
21224,-1,fahrenheit 451,the book has a good theme but it just dragged on. i did not like this book. montag is stupid to revolt in the first place he knows its the law and he knows what will happen to him if he does. Why did clarisse die there was no point to that just one day mildred said she was dead and montag was like oh ok it was lame and boring. i recomend this book to no one.
21228,-1,this book was awful,This book makes absolutely no sense at all. I read the first page and I didn't like it. I have to read it for school and I have fallen asleep 4 times reading it. All of my friends hate it to. We have a test on the 2nd day of 8th grade. Even using the Cliffs Notes didn't help at all. I don't recommend this book to anyone.
21235,-1,Fahrenheit 451....It sets a new record in boredom.,"After reading it for a school project I would avise anyone reading these reviews to stay clear of it unless your eighty and you want waste your last few months of your life. Pointless, which school teachers of little old scotland make you read. If we have to burn books I put this one up to get burned straight away."
21244,-1,How ironic - text to speech (tts) not enabled,"How ironic that a book about limiting access to books is NOT text-to-speech enabled. By preventing access to TTS, the publisher has denied my blind husband the opportunity to read this book on his Kindle through text-to-speech as he wants to do. He will not buy audio books so the publisher makes no sale at all. He bought his Kindle for the express purpose of being able to read books through the text-to-speech function. Unfortunately, too many books have this feature disabled - often through Simon & Schuster. It is especially ironic that the publisher would limit the blind community's access through Kindle TTS when this book centers around removing access to books. Everyone loses."
21248,-1,Painful listening,"Ray Bradbury was a fantastic WRITER. I wish he would have stuck to his strengths. Choosing to read this book himself for the audio recording was a tremendous mistake. His speech is, at times, nearly unintelligable (He was over 80 years old at its recording). What should have been a wonderful audio book ended up being a complete chore to listen to. Writers of films know enough to cast proffesionals to act-out their visions. Writers should be no different. Do yourself a favor, read the book yourself."
21252,-1,Painful to listen to,Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read but deadly to listen to on the CD. Ray Bradbury reads in expressionless monotony. I tried to listen to the first CD five times and finally gave up. Stick with the book where you can supply your own voices.
21255,-1,Awful,I read this book and i hated it. Don't waste your money on it. It will ruin any respect you have for books. Three words: DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!

In all fairness, my cigarette lighter may be on the brink and therefore not transferring current/voltage; I doubt it though.

21268,-1,"Slow, buggy, and awful","I had high hopes for this game since I'm a big Tolkien fan and really like good GBA RPGs. Boy, was I disappointed! First off the game is horribly slow. Combat takes forever, and is boring since your character miss all the time. You'll spend hours walking around looking for mundane items like flowers or Pippen.Add to that fact that the game is horribly buggy. Gimli turns invisible in one quest, sometimes the elves don't give you items you need, and I've yet to meet anyone online who found a way out of Moria without the game crashing.Don't buy this waste of a game. Save your money and either wait for one of the other Lord of the Rings games coming out this Christmas (The Two Towers) or buy Golden Sun or Castlevania instead. This is a prime example of a great license going to waste."
21270,-1,disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Tolkein books and lord of the rings especially. This was actually a pretty fun game for a while, I can't complain, I bought it in a bargain bin for $5 bucks, and I was thinking ""What am I going to lose?"" I lost 5 bucks and I want it back. I liked how it had aspects of the books instead of the movies in them, like Tom Bombadil and such. I would have more stars for it (1, mayyybe 2) if I didn't get stuck in Rivendell. I think I got Gimili's axe a step ahead of when I was supposed to and when I talk to him he says he needs it. Game over. There is nothing I can do to progress. And what really sucks is that I saved it before I knew that I was stuck. So its either spend another 3-5 hours replaying it and getting back to that part to progress, or quitting. I think I'll just quit and maybe sell it for a buck on Amazon."
21273,-1,Pitiful game,This game has so many bugs I'm suprised it works at all. I can't even finish because of a glitch in the Mines of Moria. I wish I could get my money back.

21278,-1,"Sorry, try again","This ""book"" (40 pages, including the back cover as a page!) is very close to completely useless. Poorly organized, it does give some useful information, but it rarely puts it in a useful context. The very few drawings are of poor quality and tiny to boot! If you're looking for a start-to-finish process of how to side a house, as I was, this is NOT it."
21280,-1,Disappointing,"At first this headset worked well, then it began producing occasional feedback and echo sounds. Now, 14 months later, right after the warrantee expired, I've called support to be informed that the unit is bad and that a repair will cost about $150.Personally, I expect a lot more from a headset that cost over $300."
21288,-1,DON'T GET THIS!,"OK, amazon.com is completely wrong. It says this card is worth [$$$] give or take five cents. The new one, supposedly comming out in August or September, is much better, and is going to be at a retail price of [$$$]. Itis MUCH better, and definately worth the wait. HOWEVER, if you must buy a new graphics card now, you should get the NVIDIA ti 4600 by VISION TREK. Not, by PNY, their customer service is very bad, even though they give a very good warranty. (Even read other reviews about PNY consumers). The NVidia 4600 is much better than the ATI 8500, however again, when the ATI 9700 comes out, that will take the crown. Until than, the NVidia 4600 is proudly wearing it."
21289,-1,Be aware of ATI products,"I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great. I have quite extensive experience with PCs (I have put together over 100 of them) and it took me 6 hours to make this card work. I would give it more stars but..... First of all, when I bought it, it said on a box that FREE VideoStudio 6.0 by Ulead is included. Well it wasn't, instead there was VideoStuio 5.0 which I wasn't able make it work. Secondly, when I tried to contact ATI by email I was getting stupid autoreply totally unrelated to my question why ATI company is cheating their customers. I would call them but they charge you over [X] a minute for support. So the bottom line don't count on any support from ATI."

21299,-1,An Udder Disaster,"The cow who dried up was an udder disaster....like this gibberish novel. Even JJ's best friends and critics called it drivel (his brother included). I guess after writing Ulysses, JJ felt somehow had to create something more mystic. Well, he certainly succeeded. I have a standing $1,000 bet with anyone and the challenge is that I will open 3 random pages of FW and have the reader explain, in detail, who the parties are, what the sentences are about and mean. I am quite confident than there is no one out there who can do that. Period. So much for a memorable reading experience."
21301,-1,NOOOOOO,NO! BOOK BAD BOOK BAD BIG BIG WORDS I DONT UNDERSTAND! MY BRAIN HURTSSSS! THIS MAKE NO SENCE. YAHOO CHAT MUCH EAZYIER TO UNDeRSTAND! I GO THERE NOW.
21303,-1,this is bad,"This book is bad, and I think it was intended to be so. Probably upset with the over analysis of Ulysses, Joyce must have set out to play a trick on the literary world. This book has no value except to make you laugh at how far some people would go to pretend that it could be interpreted. There are better wastes of ones time, for example staring at a blank wall."
21311,-1,DON'T BUY THIS CARD IF YOU ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE,"I bought this card, and within minutes of purchasing the card on Amazon.com I tried to cancell it, I purchased the wrong card.

21320,-1,Broke on second use,I was excited because the collar seemed to work. My dog obviously didn't like it and tried to paw it off but as long as I kept moving he only occasionally pawed it and didn't pull. He usually pulls nearly constantly despite my efforts. However half way through my second walk my 23 pound dog stopped to sniff something. I kept going and the strap that goes around his nose broke. Don't waste your money.
21325,-1,This is the single worst quality blu-ray I have seen yet.,"The movie was ok, as much as a let down as 200 was, but at least it was ok.Blu-ray on a decent TV makes this thing look like utter and complete crap.I returned it to the store to get the DVD because at least that doesn't look as bad.The lack of quality on the picture makes me ashamed to be a fan."
21337,-1,What a waste!,"""What a waste of money! "" These words demonstrate my exact reaction after watching this movie which I have regrettably purchased on DVD. Excited to have a new DVD player, I bought this DVD after reading the many great reviews about the movie. Now I'm extremely puzzled. Why so much praise for this flick? It is anything but interesting: the story is childish and shallow and the much talked about cinematography and the music are nothing more than cheap attempts to decorate the silly plot. For those of you who want to buy the movie, rent it first! If you are not a fad-driven kid who actually thinks MTV is a music television and Jewel a poet, then you'll surely dislike it. There are no philosophical ideas here. The mere fact that this movie is considered to be ""thought provoking"" may be a testament to the reality that perhaps we are not thinking much."
21356,-1,Very disappointed,I am serving the military overseas ai expect delays over stateside deliveries. In this case the product did not arrive and I have contacted the seller through e-mail twice to let them know that the product never arrived. I have never heard back from the seller. Very frustrated.
21365,-1,Terrible motivational film,"If you like crappy motivational films that make your employees feel like they are being brainwashed when they watch the videos you present them than Ride The High Places is just what you need. You should be ashamed of yourself if this crap inspired you to do anything in life. Useless video garbage, 18,000,000 thumbs down."
21369,-1,Numbingly bad.,"Only in this, the age of mediocrity, could a piece of rubbish like this get made. Owen Wilson turns in one of the worst performances in recent memory. This was made strictly for the idiots who find MTV worthwhile part of our culture."
21370,-1,One of the worst of 99...,"Question: How do you take an excellent cast, millions of dollars, top of the line FX, base it on a good movie only toturn it into a piece of unwatchable garbage? Answer: Let Jan de Bont direct it."
21381,-1,Absolutely horrible,"Movies don't get much worse than this one, folks. The plot was poor and the acting was terrible. The scene near the beginning with the two ladies prancing around the house was incredibly lame. The filmmakers tried to overcome the shoddy storyline by tossing in some mediocre special effects. If they were intended to be a distraction, they didn't work.I have to admit, my review is based only on the first 30 or so minutes of the movie. That was all I could take before I got up off the couch, rewound the film, and promptly returned to the video store."
21385,-1,what a joke,"this movie is so stupid. waste of anybody's money or time. Not even Catherine Zeta Jones can make it seem worth watching. no parts in the movie were scary at all. In fact, was this a comedy by mistake?"
21393,-1,99.9 FAILURE!,"The only thing in this ""horror"" film that made it was the house and Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, looking good!, but the story was so forced, it never caught any horror, the special effects were cartoon like, not one bit frighting, the original movie and the short story will scare the pants off you, and why?, because your mind can conger up all the horror you want, your minds eye will take you to all those dark corners you fear, oh, and another thing that ruined the movie for me is, Owen Wilson, can't stand him!, how he ever got in movies is beyond me!, ignore this cluttered up movie and go to the original black and white one and get set to be terrified!"
21396,-1,Come on!,"This has to be the stupidist movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrible besides Catherine Zeta Jones( she is excellent). But I mean the other girl in there was so dull, 1 word comes to mind when I think about this movie LIFELESS. Cant these producers waste 10 million on a movie that will be eerie or scary, because in my opinion this was just horrible."
21400,-1,A waste of valuable money!,"I saw a commercial for this movie. The special effects looked great. I was expecting to see a great action-packed movie. A friend and I anxiously stepped into the theater. The movie started with a little action, but then it was gone. Nothing. That was it. I actually fell asleep during it, something I never did before! This was one of the STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen in my life. It doesn't even deserve one star, but I've got to give it something. If you think that this looks like a good deal, think again. Your money is worth something much better for the same price."
21401,-1,Please!,"This was a horride movie. It had some creepy sceans, but the story was flater than paper. This proves that a movie doesn't need special effects to be scary. I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" and that was much better (And more scary) than this movie. Don't waste your money."
21402,-1,horribly......stupid,"Liam Neeson is pathetic. Catherine Zeta-Jones is sham. The young boy is boring, though i gave him a pity because he's killed for no reason. The only thing i was moved by is the girl and her story, her family story; in fact, the story itself is pretty interesting, so there's huge disappointment's waiting for you. Except computer effect there's almost nothing."
21409,-1,ADS Instant Video,"You get audio signal onlt with no picture when you try to capture home movie from comcaorder tape. In very few case, I captured the video footage, but i just get the audio when you paly it back.When you sent the problem to ADS customer service, you get automatical e-mail response said they will respond to your questions ASAP. but, you never get e-mail unless you call them. the phone line is so busy, you wouldn't be so patient."
21411,-1,Do Not Buy,I know because I bought it. The gyroscope spins out of control and the string snaps on the first pull. The gyroscope is UGLY and DULL. I am Verry Disappointed and so will you if you get this. Do Not Buy it. It is made of lead and stains your finger when you toutch it. This Toy is Very Low Quality and it stinks. As I said Before Do not Buy.
21412,-1,doesn't wash off that easily,We bought this thinking our kids would love it. They did love painting. But the problem came when we tried to wash it off. We cleaned it about 30 minutes after the kids started and we had to get out the pressure washer. It took about an hour to clean up. It was by far the worst clean up. It does not come off that easily. the regular hose did nothing to get it off.
21413,-1,Won't work in Dimage 7i,"Inserting this card in my new Minolta Dimage 7i (digital camera), I get an ""Unable to use card"" error. The card is evidently incompatible with the 7i. Others have had the same experience. See the digital camera forums.Check the compatibility chart at minoltausa.com before you buy!"
21414,-1,Too much money for a medicore card,"The card isn't very good and stores pictures too slowly, especialy as you start to fill up the memory. Also SimpleTech's customer support isn't too good. Not one person could tell me what the 'Error Application' message meant when using the Simple Tech CompactFlash Card Reader to get pictures from the card.Stay away from this company."
21422,-1,I hated this book,"This book was a total waste of time. I kept thinking that it was going to lead somewhere or reveal something, but it never did- it just kept repeating names until I had no idea and no longer cared who was who and rambled on to an unfulfilling end."
21424,-1,"Magical, mystical piece of tripe","I read (well, not really...I got to page 100 and felt like I'd read it three times already) this book over ten years ago and I still rank it as the worse piece of tripe that I ever had the misfortune to come across. But I'm biased. Like most Latins, I think the whole ""magical and mysterious"" cloak with which Latin literature is viewed abroad is unfortunate, but ultimately it's that kind of rubbish that sells."
21428,-1,500 pages of boredom,"The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that's another discussion. To give Marquez credit, his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under, but it is, nevertheless, a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don't move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?Marquez' book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores."
21431,-1,100 years of boreitude,"I can count on one hand the number of books in my life that I have been unable to finish. I am oftimes mocked for my reading, the rate at which I devour books being astronomical, but I could not drag my weary brain kicking and screaming through more than a few dozen pages of this book.I love a good fantasy novel, or anything that gives you a sense of the magical, but I could not find anything interesting in the random and inexplicable bizarre occurrences in this book. Mix that with the dry, long winded prose and I find myself doing something I have NEVER done; sitting with a book in my hands, looking around the room for something else to do."
21435,-1,pointless,This is one of the hardest to read most pointless books I have ever had the misfortune of trying to read.
21436,-1,Emporer's new clothes.,"I'm one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so I plugged away hoping I'd experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have found...but I just didn't get it. Maybe it lost something in the translation, but I prefer a little dialog in my fiction...even in my heavy, pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction. I don't mind the magic realism, but I do get bored with sentences that run on for two-plus pages without a period. Oh, well, chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck who's educated beyond his intelligence. But I was underwhelmed."
21444,-1,Can I give it -9999 Stars instead?,"Yawn. 400 some pages of nothing but incest and death. Characters with the same name throughout the book. Non-linear time, too, it's very hard to follow. How could this ""book"" change your life? I have come to fear love, it's like your emotions are being dragged through the mud and everything you hold dear and ethical are just pushed away like its nothing. It was about incest, personally, maybe something was lost in the translation. It was so depressing and disturbing. I could not sleep without lights on after I finished reading it. I would never suggest this book to anybody who has a weak constitution or is easily emotionally disturbed. NOT good reading for a highschool student. Even Faulkner's The Bear was not about incest (it was bad too)."
21445,-1,Book,"This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all."
21455,-1,HarperCollins needs to get with the times,"Why is the publisher setting the price for the Kindle version the same as the paperback? Apparently they live in some fantasy world where either paper is free, or duplicating bytes is expensive."
21465,-1,Dull and Annoying,"A small town girl who comes to the city to become a star is a premise as old as the cinema. Coyote Ugly is just repeating this, with a particularly annoying character who suffers from one of the most demented looking cases of stage fright I've ever seen.Jerry Bruckheimer usually does good films, but this is a case in which I would love to ask him what he was thinking. The only attraction to this film is a bunch of girls dancing on top of the bar, and the singing of LeAnn Rimes. He could easily have just made a few music videos and dispensed with the vehicle for presenting them. It would have done us all a favour."
21477,-1,really weak Film,nothing really happening with this Film.the Girls were Looking Good but as far as the Film Goes not much Happening.it's one of those films you watch when you are in Pure T&A type of Mood.it's fairly a Air-Head Film.
21483,-1,"I like the idea, BUT...","As both a surfer and yoga enthusiast i was excited to see this program created, however, upon watching the video it became clear that it's not all that great. It's hard to follow the poses when you can't see the instructors feet b/c they're buried in the sand and unless you have a decent knowledge of yoga there are a lot of important details about many of the poses that are left out. I'd recommend a non-surfing specified yoga dvd over this. You'll get more out of it."
21487,-1,WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS STORE AGAIN!,This book arrived 2 months after I ordered it. I had already went to my trip to Greece. I was so pissed off!
21489,-1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. A total rip off.","This 52 minute video is nothing more than 8-10 minutes of bad content on a loop. It is a video of one woman doing sing-along style songs. Any claims that this is a ""Sign Language"" video are dubious at best. There are very few real American Sign Language signs, so few as to be pointless. An episode of Blues Clues has more signs. I feel ripped off, and I didn't even pay any money of out my own pocket (I was using $15 in free Amazon Unbox credit from a promotion). Stay away from this video at all costs. I highly recommend Signing Time, which isn't yet available from Amazon Unbox. I hope it will be soon; I'm going to send the makers of Signing Time an email asking them to get their content online."
21498,-1,Most horrendous test prep book in press...,"Amazon should offer negative star ratings, because one star is far too glamorous a prize for this untrustworthy and erroneous book. I am shocked at the simple lack in proofreading the text, question, and answers. Students of Chem should never buy this book, and those that have should write the publisher and demand a refund. The only good use for this text would be as camp fire fuel."
21501,-1,Not so good,"I had three books to help study for this exam including this one. This book has many errors and it also doesn't explain things very well. I don't even know if there is a good study guide out there because the one from ETS doesn't even tell you how to do the problems, it just tells you the answers."
21508,-1,May not appeal to toddler,"My 3-year old toddler loved playing ""snatch-the-toast"" from her toy toaster so I bought her the crocodile dentist. However, she is scared stiff of the clamping action and refused to play with it. She started removing the sticker-eyes and -nostrils instead. Toy is durable per se but stickers can be easily removed. I had to glue them back with superglue, which is better lasting. I came to a conclusion that she is still too young to play with the crocodile dentist and I intend to keep it for her later on."
21512,-1,doesn't live up to expectations,"Since this game gave no dimensions, I had to guess at it's size. From the photos that I saw, I assumed that the toy would be bigger then it actually was. It is small, about the size of my fist. The idea of the game is to keep pressing teeth until you reach the sore one, at which time the jaw will snap shut. However, the jaw very frequently pops off completely when snapping shut and requires an adult to put it back together. The teeth often do not reset after the jaw has snapped shut and have to be manually pried back into position to be able to play again. All in all, a disappointment and not worth the money it would cost to send it back."
21516,-1,unhappy,"don't buy this, broke out of the box,poor quality item, dissapointed child,worst present ever,stay away from this game not worth the time or money"
21517,-1,broken when I opened the box,"When I opened the box, I pushed down the teeth to see how hard it would clamp shut and it didn't clamp shut. I returned the toy to the company and will not be purchasing another one. I was originally excited about this purchase as I have seen the toy before and the kids really liked it."
21527,-1,I did not receive the item,I did not receive this item. I filed the claim but I did not hear from the seller at all.
21531,-1,"Boring,Boring,Boring,,,","How an author can create such great characters while writing a novel free from compelling circumstances is surprising. Ho hum, I can't believe she's dead, let's pour ourself another drink. I can't believe her mother showed up, ho-hum let's pour another drink and watch her clean the house. One big secret does surface, but it is rather mundane in it's telling. At the end everyone gets better, while the Mom who is easily the most exciting of the group, realizes life does go on after the loss of a child. Even if'ts is a miserable and shallow existence. Color this whole novel as grey and bland as a grief stricken day in the Hamptons. I was disappointed because I really looked forward to this book, and intead could barely muster the energy to finish it."
21534,-1,Disappointed,I read this book and hoped against hope for something new in vampire lore but it's basically the same old stuff not very interestingly written.
21539,-1,Horrible,"I own the Swissmar Borner V Slicer and find it to be of exceptional quality (very sharp and useful). This item, however, is not. Maybe if you are using this tool to make interesting Veg'Art, but I found it wouldn't even peel a potato properly. The peeler part is so dull I'm not sure what anyone would do with that feature. The rest of the tool is plastic. I wish I never purchased this since it is not worth paying to send the item back."
21541,-1,Santana - Live by Request,"War Of The Worlds will about blow my windows out. I have the newest and greatest Home theater systems with 15"" speakers. This DVD is flat. Sounds like a mono system from the 50s"
21548,-1,"Pretty sad, fake pictures and nearly all adds.","Fake airbushed pictures, ie Andy Roddick. That guys arms turned out bigger than his waist. This magazine used to be okay. I think they spend more time with tanning, lights, make-up and Photoshop that they do with real athletes. If they cut out the ""4-page advertisements"" every 6 pages along with all the adds at back of the magazine it would consist of the cover and a 1/2 page article. They should pay people to accept it in the mail, hard to charge for a brochure. I just wish it was more ""real"" and less about selling us on smelling like roses and wearing $350 desinger shoes, cater to the average Joe who just wants to get good info and work-out ideas. I could watch QVC and MTV to cover any lack of B.S. I may be experiencing. Your best bet is to just surf the net, buy books, save your money."
21554,-1,An abomination,"I'm a Stanford-trained MD and practicing psychiatrist and I have to say that this book is worse than terrible. It is the most dangerous kind of religious propaganda mixed in with a hefty dose of hateful, spurious, ignorant ideas."
21562,-1,This is not the screenplay,"This is the script for the stage play, which has been updated for modern times. If you are looking for the script for the 1987 film, keep looking."
21567,-1,"I am yet to receive this book, first time I ever had a problem",I am disappointed that the book has not yet come. I have always used Amazon and never had a problem before. I assume the seller is to blame. My calls have produced no results
21569,-1,Rip Off,"First, the DVD was produced in Germany, and you have your choice of the instructor speaking in his native German or dubbed into English. Second, the German-language menu works, but the English-language menu does not. The only way to navigate through the English version is to either fast forward or keep jumping to the next chapter. Third, this is not for beginners. I'm a beginner and I should know."
21575,-1,Doesn't work,This product will come up with the networks in the area. If you put in the network pass key it will connect then immediately disconnect. I bought it because I don't have alot of money and I wanted to get a wireless adapter cheap. Don't buy. Fork out the extra money on a better adapter.
21577,-1,Waste of money,"This program does have some good hiking information but it is not very user friendly at all. The maps are the worst part of it, you can either look at a small general state map or zoom to a trail map NOTHING in-between. If you want to find trails (and don't know the trail name) you have to guess on the state which only lists major cities. All you can do is click on the small state map and hope it is near the town you are looking for. If you know the trail name then it is OK. My advice is save your money and use the internet because there are many hiking web sites that have the same or more trail information and are a lot easier to use."
21581,-1,Worthless,It should have got 0 rating. You could buy a English-French dictionary instead of buying this. This does not 'teach' you anything. Do not spend your heard earned money on this
21582,-1,Next time read the item description Edgardo,"This is not a book so much as a bunch of quotes made by Tozer, put together in a way to look pretty and make the publisher some $$ off people like me who love Tozer's works. There is nothing of value here. Read the Pursuit of God by Tozer if you you want something to challenge you and guide you, not this."
21584,-1,not sufficient after a long day at the computer,I am a writer and have to work 8 hours straight at a keyboard for clients when on tight deadlines. It was suggested by a specialist that I ice my wrists every night. I thought this would be a neat way to do it. The concept is good but the beads never get cold enough to accomplish the therapy and subsequent relief needed.
21588,-1,Mising Information/Incomplete,"This is one of my all time favorite books but;This Kindle version is missing very important parts to the story. Every time a letter or newspaper is read it is left blank. The whole story is based on the information in the letter and newspaper clippings. They are missing in this edition, even as a previous fan of the story I am having some difficulty in following along. If you are not familiar with the story you will be completely lost."
21594,-1,Stick with SimCity or Capitalism 2,"I was thinking ""SimCity helped me learn about real estate and land use in a fun way, so maybe this game might help me learn something."" This game has no educational value. But more importantly, it wasn't even fun.Okay, maybe it was fun for about an hour as I learned my way around the game. But that was mostly anticipation. I then realized that I'd seen all there was to see. Don't waste your time. This game is simplistic and has no depth whatsoever. SimCity is still the best real estate game around, even if it is only in a roundabout sort of way. If you want a good, educational business game, try Capitalism 2. Good tutorials and an actual understanding of how businesses run. If you want a fun business game, there are plenty of other tycoon games that have to be better than this."
21598,-1,Bleh!,"Honestly, I'm shocked that this production has received such high praise. I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma. Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking. I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed. She just creeped me out.Austen fans should probably watch it, just so they can say that they watched it, but I recommend borrowing it rather than paying money for it."
21604,-1,"Horrible, wretched, totally overrated","Unless you are one of those men who thinks any film with lots of female nudity is ""art,"" skip this. It's stupid, sexist, pretentious, the dialogue is wretched, you don't CARE about any of the characters... and a lot of other things that other reviewers have already said."
21608,-1,Horrible!,"Brando is my favorite actor and he's known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job. He did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one. I am an admirer of ""off the edge"" movies and themes that are hard to take....However, this film leaves the viewerwith only one thought ""Bertolucci is a filthy, lecherous old man"". I rarely HATE a movie but this bankrupt, purely perverted film is just AWFUL. Hope Brando made a lot of money at least."
21612,-1,I'm glad I didn't spend the money on it.,"I got it at the library and boy am I glad I didn't waste my money by buying it, which I might have done based on Donati's first novel. I am sooo disappointed! This was a snoozorama to say the least. I guess I can only hope for improvement in the 3rd novel. This novel was just sooooooo slow and boring, Daniel and ""Boots"" had no chemistry which was very disappointing"
21615,-1,Not as good as her other books,"I enjoyed the rest of the series, but I found this book boring compared to the rest. Much of the story is spent on a ship, and I did not feel that the characters that were introduced were developed very well. The other books in the series are much better."
21622,-1,Dumb and Dumber and Dumber and,"Six macho bisexual chicks go caving and find blind creepy underground things.Hey girls, don't be so cheap and rent a guide who has done that cave before...duhhh.It's hard to feel sorry for dumb and dumber and dumber and...."
21623,-1,"trash, i wish I could give it no stars!!!!!!","I love horror movies!!! But this is really a horrible movie, the gore looks fake and a lot of it appears to be cg although some real props were used. The actresses were very bad at acting, and not in that cool b-horror movie way either, they suck. I know tons of gore fans like myself may like this movie but its trash,THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT IS ONLY 90 MINUTES LONG!!!!!!Guess I will start having to go back to the Asian import shop for good horror."
21624,-1,SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!,"I thought this movie was one of those horror movies that took forever to get to the point!!!It reminded me of Wolf Creek which I barely watched. These movies make you want something to happen so bad that u almost turn the movie off. Finally when it did get to the good parts they were pretty good. I wish the story line could have figured out a different way to find these creatures instead of showing flashbacks of people cheating with other women's husbands before he died and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. Different storyline, same characters. Might have then been awesome!"
21632,-1,beware,"The product does give the surround sound experience, which sounded okay in my cars audio system. However,this version is not the orchestral sound I was expecting. Rather it is more of an organ piece, which I find not as rich or vibrant."
21634,-1,oh my goodness!,"If this is a single release, that must mean the full album on CD would run about $700. The dollar must have dropped through the floor."
21635,-1,Dummy Scared the Be-Jesus Out of Me,"Oh, God, do I remember seeing the dummy's face in the ads. That was the scariest thing about this movie. I was probably about 8 or 9 at the time. I remember watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" on a Friday night and the commercials came on. This face appeared on the screen and I thought it might be the show, but it wasn't. They kept zooming in on him and I got scared. From then on, every time I saw the ad, I would switch the channel or cover my eyes. And over the years, whenever I've seen the ad, I've nearly jumped out of my skin. Yeah, Fats was SCARY!"
21646,-1,Poorly written and insulting,"Let me first say that I read the reviews of this work and rushed out and bought it. I wish I had slowed down and read a few pages in the store, because I would have left it there. I found this book insulting on more levels then one, to the point that I was unable to finish it. All of the characters were simple and single minded with no signs of intelligent life anywhere to be found! I am at a lose of words to describe how bad this book is. I would recommend, despite what you have read here, don't buy it. For the record, I am an avid reader who enjoys the likes of Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Anne Rice, Terry McMillan, Valerie Wilson Wesley, and many others. If you want a good, easy read about African American life, I would suggest Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made. It is a much better read!"
21648,-1,This album sucks,All I can say is this album sucks bad!! Ghostface Killah really sucks now and his lyrics are made for ignorant black people who don't know any better.. I threw this CD out my window it sucked so bad! disgrace to music
21649,-1,Pretty Toney,Unfortunately or on Purpose!!! this album was released 2 weeks ago on the Net...and I had a chance to preview it - there a handful of solid tracks but as a referral the better album is Pretty Toney - The B-Sides...every track is a hit...I dont know why Def Jam did not want to buy those songs the lyrics and production are amazing...peace.
21650,-1,Warning,"The music on this CD is great. My comments have to do with the way in which Amazon describes the product. This is a CDR, without any liner notes and the track listing basically copied from the web site. But you will not learn this by looking at the Product Details. You will find this information under Editorial Reviews, where it says: This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.While this information would have been better placed under Product Details no where does it tell you that you will not receive the liner notes.Amazon is misrepresenting the product. I hope my short review will help others who are considering purchasing the CD."
21654,-1,Warning: Clip Job - Search out the Original,"The other user comments are technically correct. The film is great... in its original version. ""Deadly China Hero,"" however, is a clipped version of the film ""Last Hero of China."" I highly recommend the original film instead of this one, which cuts out several crucial scenes and important subplots. There's no reason to settle for this hacked-up version."
21657,-1,Does not fit vacuum,"The bag is unusable in the vacuum for which it is marketed. According to the written description and picture, this bag is made for this vacuum. It does not fit the attachment inside the vacuum and is completely unusable. It is a total waste of money."
21658,-1,warm only not hot,"It keeps your coffee warm but not hot. The problem is that most cups that are made do not have a flat bottom, therefor do not have enough contact with the heater to transfere heat to the cup."
21662,-1,not warm enough,"The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer will only keep your coffee, or whatever, a little warmer than room temperature. Bought three of these pieces of junk for the office. They're going back to the store for a refund. Coffe has to be up to a certain degree of temperature to taste right. This junker does not reach that temperature."
21673,-1,Where the hey does one find a flat bottomed mug?,"I ordered two of this item, so certain was I that this would do the trick for my coffee staying hot. It makes complete sense to me that it needs a flat bottomed mug in order to work efficiently and I never gave a thought when ordering that a flat bottomed mug would be so elusive!I have looked high and low. If anyone reading this review knows where I can locate such an animal, please let me know before I send this purchase back. Without the aforementioned flat bottomed mug, the product does a very poor job - so poor as to be useless!"
21674,-1,The WORST!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,Ok.....I threw away the one I was using in my office before this because it was no longer getting my cups of coffee hot...only tepid and therefore wasting energy. Silly me. I was SURE ( since I read all reviews) that this mug warmer by Mr. Coffee would be so great that I just tossed my old one before receiving this. HUGE mistake! This has got to be the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon! I tried for days with several different shaped mugs of tea or coffee ...nothing..none of them got more than BARELY tepid! It is very hot to the touch.....but for some ridiculous reason it WILL NOT HEAT YOUR CUP OF LIQUID....and I'm speaking of a hot cup of coffee to start with! I was so surprised that I kept trying different mugs...thinking maybe it's the shape or...??? Nothing worked. Nothing.Please do not waste your time. Do not purchase this product!!
21675,-1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased the Mr. Coffee mug warmer because it was economical and I believed Mr. Coffee to be a reputable brand.Don't waste your money on this mug warmer, even if it's economical. There are good points -- nice length to the cord; convenient on/off switch. But the reason for purchasing a mug warmer is to keep the contents warm, even somewhat heated. This warmer does not do that. It barely keeps the coffee lukewarm. I previously had a warmer by Continental Electric which kept the coffee at a very nice temperature and it was never cooled to the ""tepid"" point.This model is not worth the money or effort. Check out the Continental Electric instead, even if it's more expensive."
21683,-1,not worth the money,"This a a huge waste of money. I am so disappointed in Mr. Coffee, I've liked their other products but this does NOT keep your cup of coffee even lukewarm."
21694,-1,Ugh,I read four chapters and put the book up for sale without finishing it. Why do some of these romance writers think it endears us to their heroes and heroines for them to be dumber than dirt? And why do they think it's funny to repeat the same thing over and over and over?Ugh. I got rid of Bradley...and Cruisie as an author I'll pick up and read.
21695,-1,Boring and hard to watch/listen,Waste of money. I purchased all 7 and gave them away. Hard to watch.
21702,-1,Smallville ninth season,This is the 2nd time I have received this product and it still doesn't work ... All others do ... I will have to send it back
21706,-1,Who did shoot down the Red Baron? The other side of the coin - in fairness.,"To be perfectly fair about it, NOVA's documentary disputes the claim made by Keri Bailey ""Kilby"" in the review regarding the death of Manfred von Richtoven - so while Bailey cites undenialble proof - NOVA's documentary shows another side of the story claiming that RAF Flier Roy Brown did not and could not have shot down the ""Red Baron."" It includes autopsy reports and photos which neither showed nor described a head wound as cited by Bailey's claim.This review is made by author of Blood of Scotland, M.E. Grant."
21708,-1,Amethyst sterling bracelet,"This is made OK. The stones are washed out, no color. Purchased for gifts but will not give them as it will embarrass me. I would have returned them but I was traveling and missed the deadline."
21709,-1,Viewer from NY,I am in complete agreement with the viewer from MN as to the unfortunate full screen format this DVD version was produced in. What a blunder! What a loss of visual information so important to the script! I have had to make a VHS recording off of TCM when THEY presented the movie in its' Letterbox format. I hope someone smartens-up and rereleases Moonstruck on DVD that delivers all the great cinematography.
21712,-1,To call this widescreen is fraud,"I just bought this widescreen edition and feel totally ripped off!!! I own the standard format edition, and because I love this movie so much, it was worth buying again in the widescreen format. This ""widescreen"" edition is nothing more than the standard format edition with the top and bottom chopped off! This is one time you are actually better off with the standard format edition. I watched both editions side by side, and the widescreen edition was not much wider, and missing the top and bottom of the picture! There was actually more to see in the standard format edition."
21713,-1,it would have been good if cher wasn't in it,her fake italian accent ruined everything! They should have gotten a real talented italian actress to be in this movie instead.
21716,-1,Warning - This Movie is Pan & Scan,totally unacceptable. I would not buy this movie until they come out with a version with the Original Aspect Ratio.
21722,-1,NOT for introductory food,"The AAP says not to make your own green beans, spinach, squash etc. due to the higher levels of nitrates so I thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my 6 month old. The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job."
21724,-1,RASH CITY,Left my baby with a diaper rash after 2 days of use. I didn't suspect it was from the diapers at first until a couple weeks later I went to finish using up the package and her rash appeared again. I'll never use pampers again.
21728,-1,Leaks at the kid's belly,"Leaks at my kid's belly (especially during his sleep or nap), which is totally unacceptable.Pampers Swaddlers, Huggies, and even Costco's Kirkland Signature don't have this issue. This diaper is good for daytime only. We bought Huggies for night time or naps.Very disappointing."
21730,-1,HORRIBLE!,"These diapers are the worst. I bought them thinking that I wouldn't have any nighttime accidents & my son would wake up dry.Boy was I wrong! Carson wakes up almost every morning with spoiled sheets.I use the Pampers Sensitive during the day, & thought that the Dry Max would make him feel more dry - but he wets his diaper almost every night!They are also not as soft as the Pampers Sensitive - which was a downside to the Dry Max diapers, too.I wish I would have gotten a smaller amount, not a box of 200+. It was such a waste of my money. For a diaper that makes big promises, I am greatly disappointed."
21731,-1,They burst when full,"I bought these as a ""night time"" diaper. Most of the time, they work great. However, if the diaper gets too full, they just burst and the absorbant material goes everywhere (about the consistency of little bits of tapioca). It is very difficult to get all of it off of my daughter without giving her a bath, and I worry about what chemicals it might contain. This has probably happened three times in the last two months (only putting the diapers on at night). I am going to stop using them now. As a note, my daughter weighs about 24 pounds, so we are on the low end of the weight range."
21732,-1,hate them!,"Hubby brought home these diapers because we were running really low and he couldn't find the swaddlers that we normally use. I really wanted to give the diapers a chance and used them for a while, even after the first few blow-outs. There was leaking every single time. It just didn't seem to absorb anything at all. We're back to using pampers Swaddlers again and I make sure we NEVER run low!!"
21753,-1,A raw deal,"I decided to try the Pampers Dry instead of our usual Pampers Swaddlers in hopes of keeping my son more comfortable overnight, because he sleeps 8-10 hours. Huge mistake! These diapers made him more uncomfortable. He has huge sores on his bottom from these diapers. The sores developed in a little more that 24 hours of use. It started as redness and then turned into sores. At 6 months old, he has never had an issue with redness or even had diaper rash. I feel so bad for switching. Beware."
21755,-1,one mess after another,"I have been pleased with the regular pampers size 1, but I'm very disappointed with the Baby Dry Size 1. They are significantly smaller than the regular size 1 diapers and do not cover the back of my baby, so it's been one mess and clothing change after another."
21759,-1,They changed the smell: yuck!,"Well, I don't see why people can't just leave a good product alone! This WAS a good product but this box of diapers has a bad smell. It's like Pampers has added a perfume or fragrance and now the diapers smell really bad! My son had bad diaper rash & I feel the perfume/fragrance delayed the healing of and maybe even inhibited the healing process.Not good! Will be looking for a new brand of diapers! Will never buy Pampers baby dry again and am very disappointed!"
21761,-1,Leaked after 4 hours,"We accidentally bought pampers dry instead of cruisers diapers, so we decided to try them. I immediately noticed the odor of urine. When out with gramma, they leaked after 4 hours of wear. We normally use cruisers and they have provided us consistent coverage and have never failed. Cruisers seem to cover more surface area and last for 12 hours through the night. I also do not notice the urine smell as soon as the diaper becomes wet with cruisers. We will be using cruisers from now on."
21764,-1,Leaking all the time,"I have a boy and this diapers are really bad for him and for me :-/.They are leaking all the time, even if it is a new not over wet diaper.Buy something else if you don't want to wash the clothes many times a day !!!"
21776,-1,Buy swaddlers not BABY DRY,"We got a big box of ""baby dry"" from amazon. Our experience is that my son's clothes are soaked with just a small amount of liquid. On the other hand, the ""swaddlers"" take on a ton of liquid and my son stays dry as a bone and so do his clothes. We are sending these back as defective and ordering more swaddlers."
21778,-1,chemical can cause a reaction,"We usually put our baby in cloth diapers, but we do keep a stash of disposables on hand for trips and emergencies. I really wish pampers would go back to offering their usual 'cruiser' style diapers without the baby-dry. Our child has had a bad reaction to them-- she gets diaper rash almost immediately."
21779,-1,I hate these diapers,"I like Pampers but the baby dry has got to go, it has no give to the sides and DD leaked through every one of them."
21780,-1,pampers fell apart,I was very dissapointed in the quality of the last batch of pampers that I bought. 1/4 of the diapers fell apart as I was putting them on my daughter. I switched to Huggies because of this and have not bought any more pampers.
21786,-1,Hate it!!!,"At first, I thought it was just one or two diapers that have sand like in them but it's actually the whole box of diapers that have sand in EVERY DIAPER. But I willing to give it another try. Unfortunately, the 2rd and 3rd boxes were still the same (still have tons of sand like in every diaper). The changing table and crib were filled with tiny sand like everytime I changed my baby diaper. It's freaking me out cause my baby is super active and she's at the stage where she puts everything in her mouth. So, no more Pamper Baby Dry for me."
21796,-1,poor,"I was not happy with pampers diapers. I was using huggies before and after I switched to pamper, there were more leakage accidents. Plus the side wings broke couple of time while putting on diapers. So overall I was not happy with the pampers this product. I had used pampers with my first child few years ago and they were fine."
21798,-1,Poop leaks out the back,As soon as I got these diapers I was surprised at how light and thin they were and I was also worried about the absorbent pad not running all the way to the back. The next day my fears were realized and I got poop all over my shorts. It leaked right out the back. These diapers have a cheap look to them and they perform that way too. I still have about 240 of these left so it will be a long month! My wife thought it was pretty funny though.
21799,-1,Pampers Swaddlers are MUCH BETTER!,"I made the huge mistake of buying the baby dry after reading through the reviews. I thought that for the price, why not try them. What a huge mistake! I should have just bought a smaller amount to try them first. Instead we have been using these for over a month now and I have had to clean up a poop spill at least every other day. My baby was 4 months old when we started using these and since she is not eating solids yet, the poop is pretty runny. The baby dry don't absorb the runny poop and it tends to just go right up the back side of the diaper onto her outfit and usually whatever or whoever she is lying on. It's just not worth the money saved! I will only buy the Swaddlers from now on. Hope this helps someone wondering which to buy Swaddlers or Baby Dry, DEFINITELY go with the SWADDLERS!!"
21803,-1,What a disappointment,"After reading the baby dry reviews, I bought a pack of 228--BIG MISTAKE! They feel ultra soggy after 2 hours (the other brands do not) and I can't even go without changing her after her early morning feeding. When we do change her, it seems like the diaper isn't wicking the moisture away properly as she seems a little damp (yes, even after just 2 hours). I'm dissatisfied that the box says 12 hour protection, when it really maxes out at about 4 hours. Even my husband asked me why I bought the crappy brand :( We absolutely love the swaddlers and swaddlers sensitive--they both make it through the night (anywhere from 8-12 hours) for my 3 month old daughter. I'm a little disappointed in Pampers right now because we have loved all their other products, but now I feel like I'm stuck with 200+ diapers that I paid for and probably won't use."
21812,-1,Awful-chemical smell,"I have solely been a pampers mom but after buying these I'm thinking of trying something new.The diapers reeked of chemicals, very unhappy and very upset that I had 246 to go through. I will not buy diapers online again, at least not these."
21815,-1,Not so Baby Dry,"At first we tried Pampers swaddlers, and they were great except that my baby developed a diaper rash when using them. We switched to Baby Dry, and the rash went away. However, they consistantly leaked whenever he was on his side while nursing. About 10 times I have ended up with a wet lap.Also, they do not fit very well, as they have no stretch around the waist. We switched to Huggies and they are wonderful. They haven't ever leaked and they stretch around the legs and waist."
21819,-1,I do NOT like pampers AT ALL,"I use these for my son, at night since he is potty trained during the day! He has woken up wet, WAY too many times, which means he is wet AND his bed! This has NEVER happened with Luvs...they are SOO much better of a diaper and cheaper too! All pamper has going for them is their name!"
21820,-1,Never Again,"I decided to try these diapers instead of the swaddlers to save a few dollars. Needless to say that was a mistake. They claim to keep baby dry for up to 12 hours. My little one can't use these to sleep through the night (6 hours). I don't recommend these at all. Spend a few extra dollars on the swaddlers, you'll make your money back on the $ saved on extra laundry they cause because they leak."
21825,-1,Diapers arrived pre-used,"It seems virtually impossible to just contact Amazon and tell them there was a problem with my order without writing a review or packing up the diapers in the huge box, printing out a mailing label and returning them. The diapers I've been ordering monthly (Subscribe and Save) for a long time came and when I opened the plastic packing, they appeared to have been pre-wet. They had that crunchy, beady texture that diapers get when they are exposed to water. Of course, the whole reason I have them on order monthly is because I need them regularly and these came just in time-- I had run out of diapers. I have 3 kids, 3 and under and I can't easily get to the store to get more diapers so I had to use these gross diapers on my daughters AND now I have to return them to get a refund?? Something is broken with this system."
21830,-1,pampers baby dry,It gets soggy in no time and leaks out big time . The product has lost its quality .I will never buy it again .
21850,-1,Love Pampers hate these diapers,"I love Pampers products and bought these with complete confidience but I was extremely disappointed.These diapers are awful, they do not hold anything and they caused my daughter to have a rash. I only wish I had bought Cruisers."
21854,-1,These leak bad!!,"I have been loyal to Pampers diapers since my 13 month old was in Newborn Swaddlers. I tried these diapers because of the positive ratings and I am VERY disappointed. The diapers are rectangular and not good for a cruising baby. The front of the tabs turn under so they sometimes leak out the side. Also, they say they are suppose to last 12 hours. My daughter usually sleeps 10 hours straight at night and by morning the diaper has ""sweated"" pee through the diaper and through her pajamas and I've even had to change her sheets. I go through a lot more diapers with these because i have to change her very frequently. For some reason the Pampers Cruisers with dry max gave my daughter diaper rash so I guess I'm buying Huggies next time."
21856,-1,Terrible rash! Going back to Hughies,"We switch to pampers for the savings but my son developed a terrible rash. After a week (treating him in the meantime with lotions, skin barriers and other topical creams), we got back to Hughies and his rask got clearly better in a couple of days. We used pampers swadllers before wihtout any problems. I found in the internet other people with similar issues:[...]If your kid has allergies or delicate skin, I will say to do not use this diapers."
21862,-1,My husband even complains about these!!,"These diapers are junk! I recently tried some Pampers again and they were terrible! The tabs would rip off half the time and this would really make my husband disgruntled! I told him Pampers are supposed to be the ""best"" in the diaper area! He told me to stick with the Huggies! Boys and girls, quality, price, Huggies are the way to go in our household! I would not recommend these diapers for anyone, unless you like throwing unused daipers into the garbage can!"
21863,-1,HATED these pampers! Don't buy,"I purchased these Pampers from Amazon for my 7 month old. These pampers have the ability to burst open in the night while your baby is sleeping. When my daughter woke up the next morning, the pamper burst open on her belly. The padding inside the pamper was released on her belly on several other occasions. I didn't have this problem with Huggies. I will NOT purchase Pampers ever again. This is a hazard and they should be recalled."
21864,-1,I don't do novels and this is why. . .,"This author knew very little about ancient Egypt, it's people and it's history - and didn't bother to learn.A wast of time."
21871,-1,Line break hell,It is frustrating that the Kindle cannot accommodate this. It was not fun to read with awkward line breaks.
21872,-1,This book does not contain the 1855 edition!,"While I adore the first edition of Leaves of Grass, this book is not as advertised. I definitely encourage you to buy it in another edition. I returned mine with a note, so hopefully Amazon will change the description soon."
21876,-1,I hated this book,"I purchased this book based on the praise given in other reviews. I'm pretty well in touch with my feelings, but this book just didn't do it for me. The progression is disjointed and somewhat hard to follow and the portions that should have been emotional didn't really resonate with me. I also finished this in no more than thirty minutes. Overall, I'm just not pleased with this one."
21882,-1,Can this BE any more wrong?,"As a huge Audrey fan I was disgusted to see that Jennifer Love Hewit was cast to play Audrey in a biopic. Not only does JLH not resemble Audrey in any way but JLH can't act at all, in any fashion. I see this as just another chance for JLH to be overexposed as something she is not (i.e. actress, singer.) If you buy this i recomend burning it when your done."
21888,-1,terrible,Don't bother watching this movie. The facts are all wrong. The acting is not all that god. JLH tries her best but falls flat on her face. If you want to learn about Audrey read on of the many books written on her or watch the A&E biography.
21894,-1,Not so great,"I didn't buy this from Amazon, but mine is just not useable. As others have noted, it is quite a bit larger than I expected. Also, it seems to charge, the lights come on normally, but it will not charge anything. It won't work on my iPhone thru the USB port, and the AC port won't power an external hard drive.Mine may just be defective, but since I only paid $11 for it, it's just not worth pursuing a repair or replacement to me. However, just beware that it may not provide enough power to charge anything other than basic cell phones."
21896,-1,Not good at all,I got one of these a year ago. The issue I had was that the thing only had about 15mins of power before shutting down. That is usb or powering a 7w fluorescent bulb AC.
21897,-1,usless,"DEAD!!!! to long before i use it,they wont take it, dont know what else to say dont know what else to say"
21899,-1,SKIPPING CD'S,MY CD OF CASSIE'S ME AND YOU SKIPS THROUGHOUT THE CD. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I'VE RECEIVED A CD FROM AMAZON THAT HAS SKIPPED. THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I ORDER ANY CD'S FROM AMAZON. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AS I FEEL I'VE SPENT MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS.THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!!
21901,-1,meh!,"A little frustrated with the seller on this one. I bought the book and realized I got the wrong one, okay, my fault, but then I tried to contact them to return it and they just ever so not subtly refused to contact me back. Tried a couple times. This book is not good at all. I have the first one, which is amazing, but this one is so not aesthetically appealing to me. The cover made me think it would be a bunch of artists like the first but in this one they are more computer based artist and artists who paint far more loosely. Maybe that would appeal to some, or a lot, I don't know, but for me my work is tighter and this book doesn't inspire me like the first one. Overall, though, seller sucks!"
21905,-1,unusable,"This book was printed in response to my order,i.e., on demand, and the type chosen was so small I did not even attempt to read it. There were no illustrations.I subsequently bought a used copy of the paperback edition which included a brilliant preface, the illustrations, and an exponentially easier format.I threw away the copy purchased from Amazon.Probably my only truly disappointing encounter with Amazon."
21909,-1,Not as I had hoped for,"Living on the Gulf Coast of Texas, our winters are seldom cold - it rarely gets to 30 degrees. The description did not mention that these were heavy and designed for really cold weather. I now have useless sleepwear."
21917,-1,Missing The Other Five,"Like one of the other reviewers, I ordered this as a pack of six. However, it arrived and it was a single canvas in a giant box. What happened to the other five? When I contacted Amazon, it says that they're out of stock for these. Why is this happening to more than one person? Just be sure to check your box. The canvas was nice and actually what I wanted but I didn't want to pay for six and get one..."
21918,-1,DO NOT BUY!!!,This product claims to be six canvases but in fact they only send one. IT IS A RIPOFF!! DON'T BUY.
21922,-1,A nice way to flood the courts with rightwing fascists,"Not recommended for non-neoconservatives who believe in true justice. The author is just a dog for rightwing politics. The same neonazi neocons who complain about activist judges are themselves promoting their own set in the process. If you believe in losing the Constitution and turning this country into a theocratic dictatorship, then buy this book and join the losers."
21923,-1,Endorsed by Edwin Meese and George W. Bush,"As to be expected of a book endorsed by Edwin Meese and George Bush, this book talks about how to permit right wing fascism by undermining the balance of power afforded by the Judicial Branch. Phyllis is in her typical form, blasting judges for such things as ending segregation and protecting human rights. Like another reviewer said, past the title there is nothing new. If you want to see where people like Reverend Pat Mahoney, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell get their ideas of how to destroy this country by breaking down the balance of power so that they can build a murderous Theocracy, this book is for you."
21924,-1,Not convincing and overly political,"I knew mrs Schlafly's ideas from reading her columns at townhall, and this book therefore taught me nothing new. If you read the book description that is displayed above, there is no more need to buy this book.Her point: modern judges are doing a bad job because the interpret the constitution instead of listening to the majority."
21936,-1,Yuck!,"This is not a condemnation of Initial D 4th Stage which is awesome. This is to warn people who care about such things that Funimation is flat out lying on their DVD boxes. They claim that the DVD's are 16:9 and they're not, they're 4:3 widescreen. Instead of filling the entire TV or even having black bars on the top and bottom, I have black bars on all four sides of the screen and it makes it useless to watch this on a large TV. I never would've bought this if I had known what was in store for me after I popped it into my player."
21943,-1,The Invisible Plot,"Even Bela Lugosi couldn't save this turkey. The plot is idiotic, the supporting cast is dreadful, and the film is incredibly boring. Definitely not a classic."
21957,-1,Reading this book was a mistake,"Reading this book, though it was very short, was an incredibly large waste of time! It was confusing, badly written and pointless. Reading a book where the plot is hidden in choppy sentences and weird Russian words contributed to my dislike of this book. Take my advice, if you are going to read this book dont read it before bed or you will most definatly fall asleep!"
21959,-1,Very poor book,"This book lost all credibility when I read the authors' attack on fundamentalism. I am a former fundamentalist, so I might be expected to have an apostate's bias against fundamentalism, but these authors are not only inaccurate but almost comically biased. The authors claim that the fundamentalists' belief in the truth of the Bible is ""borders on idolatry,"" that fundamentalists are ""often parasitic"" and define themselves not by belief in their scriptures or truth, but by their opposition to ""other approaches."" Instead of examining the mainstream Christian fundamentalist beliefs, the authors simply define all fundamentists as having ""a totally closed world view,"" and damn all fundamentalists by guilt through supposed association with the Ayatollah Khomeini, David Koresh and the Taliban.Lastly, the title is misleading, especially when sold in secular stores, as mine was. The title would more accurately be, _A Liberal Christian Response to Philosophy_, instead of the current title."
21961,-1,horrible. save your money,"This the the absolute worst war movie ever made. It is full of HORRIBLE acting (Sean Penn is no Tom Berringer in Platoon!). The film is full of geographical inaccuracies (a train on the side of a mountain in Vietnam???). Trust me, save your money. This is blatantly an anti-war movie and has no purpose other than for some hollywood celebrity pundits trying to make soldiers look like criminals."
21973,-1,Couldn't Finish It...,"I began reading Steve Berry's books in order. The first two were fine. The Third Secret was just absurd. I got almost to the end and just gave up. Very rarely will I not finish a book once I get into it. I can overlook some implausability and use my imagination when reading, but this was just too far. I thought Dan Brown's Demons & Angels was pretty farfetched at the end, but The Third Secret is even worse. I am not particularly religious, so it wasn't that I was offended by the book. I stopped reading Mr. Berry's books for quite some time after this book. I finally decided to pick up with his next book, which is much better so far.I recommend this author, in general, for some light, entertaining reading, but skip this installment."
21979,-1,Borrowed plot + absurd conclusion = Big Disappointment,"Being a big fan of the genre, I had read quite a few of Steve Berry's books and enjoyed them up to this point. But after reading The Third Secret, I will never read another Steve Berry book again.The plot line borrowed significantly from the likes of Dan Brown in his DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons books without providing anything original besides a ludicrous conclusion. When I finally arrived at the conclusion that is so terrible it felt like I got punked by Berry, I physically threw the book down in disgust.I have never read such a terrible book in my life.Goodbye Steve Berry!"
21983,-1,disappointing and naive,"Basically I agree with John Clute's assessment of this novel. Mr. Gardner is a fine writer, but has a knack for using really dumb sociobiological explanations. Let us hope he has mulled through consequences when writing COMMITMENT HOUR. He deserves another chance."
21985,-1,"talking head, talking bunk","This is like those ""tutorials"" you find for computer programs: after the satisfied customer stumbles through it, they know nothing.If you read books like a goat eats dead grass, leaves, old paper and discarded rubbers, you'll read this, too, probably.If you want to rip people off, go out and find a certified con man. Do time. This guy just burns up his word processor and your money.""Get rich quick. Buy and sell real estate"". NO! Publish junk!"
21990,-1,bad design,"It's my first time to use TiVo. This product is not user friendly. The hardware setup requirs either network(wired) or phone line, otherwise it won't work. The software designed without exit. If you don't like any choices or you don't which one is good for your case, there is no way to skip. It takes hours to set it up. very bad design in hardware and software.Amazon service is excellent."
21995,-1,Annual Contract,"Please be aware - even when you sign up for a ""Monthly Service Plan"" - the plan itself is an annual one - the only thing monthly is the fee. I personally find this nomenclature incredibly deceptive and purposefully misleading to customers, so I would recommend staying away from Tivo."
21997,-1,Tivo doesn't stand behind their product and the warranty is worthless.,"Don't purchase the extended warranty. I purchased a 3 year extended warranty and my tivo broke after 8 months. We put up with the initial Tivo even though it would not record voice on both turners at the same time like advertised, but when the network card went out, we thought we would get it serviced. The network card went bad, so they sent me another unit, which had a hard drive failure within one day. I got a second exchange and was told my extended warranty would not cover the replacement unit and is void after the 1st exchange.Brandon the customer service person was no help at all. I will never buy anything with a tivo logo again."
22000,-1,Very Bad Experience,"Tivo worked for two weeks using the tivo wireless adapter. All of a sudden it stopped working giving a ""network adapter not found error"" Did the usual resets of the router, tivo, etc and nothing. Called tivo and they sent out a new adapter. Plugged the new adapter in and same problem. Called Tivo again, wasted a bunch of time with people who were clueless. Now I have to wait up 10 business days for a new tivo unit to arrive.To sum it up:-clueless customer service-no way to record at a given time without a network connection-froze oftenIt seems like Tivo is a company that has gotten ahead of itself."
22001,-1,tivo,"I gave it a 1-star review because I couldn't get it to work. The Dish Network package where I live wouldn't allow me to connect with the TiVo service. Before ordering this dvr, always make sure it will work with your cable or sattelite provider."
22005,-1,Quite a snag here...,"When I received my new TiVo I rushed right in to install and play with my new ""toy"". The instructions were clear and I followed them to the letter. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the second of the ""dual-tuner"" channels working. After many hours and much fiddling I gave up and called customer service. As it turned out my RF input was not working properly; however, I found out something extremely important. New laws require that all signals be digital beginning in 2009. Many providers are currently in the process of changing over now, and according to the customer service rep. the second channel of the ""dual channel"" system is analog only and therefore useless in the new digital environment. I was not made aware of this fact when I purchased the unit as it would have made a definite difference in my decision to purchase it."
22011,-1,can't get any worse,i guess i expect to much out of a cd these days. i only want to hear good songs and good music. i was sadly disappointed in this cd. predictable and boring.save your cash.
22012,-1,Ordinary pop is right.,"I like pop music, but I don't want to be bored by it. Jason Mraz is at least interesting musically. I have to agree with the others, this record doesn't quite cut it for me."
22015,-1,BAD SELLER!!!,"Fast shipping, but none of the 10 discs I bought worked. I tried different speeds, burners, and ISO's. I tried to contact Amazon and also the seller but got no response. BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
22020,-1,Billy Connolly; Live in New York,Little Disapointed seems to be old material from all his other videos Just an older Billy on stage
22026,-1,Not what it appeared to be,"The cover of this DVD shows Tarzan standing with a lion. The movie with Gordon Scott that featured that scene wasn't even one of the five movies. This is definitely not what it is portrayed as being. I was looking for Gordon Scott movies (in color), but these were black and white movies that featured several other ""Tarzans"". Only one had Gordon Scott in it, and it was not the movie that was pictured on the cover of the DVD. This was a birthday gift for someone who has been looking for Gordon Scott Tarzan movies for years, and I thought I had finally found the ""perfect"" gift.....not so."
22033,-1,...jusr miserable,"This book promotes everything that a woman should not be: stupid and submissive. I am sad for Gillian, I am totally repulsed by Broderick - a possessive and rude pig, and I am bored by the book that reaks of a day-time soap (you know what is going to happen 10 pages in advance). I am sorry, Ms. Garwood if this is an ideal love for you for it surely seems like an abuse to me. I am truely sad that women still find books like that exciting and interesting."
22037,-1,Ugh!@ I was bored!!!,"I haven't read a Julie Garwood in 10 - 20 years. I did enjoy some; Lion's Lady, The Bride, and even ""The Secret."" But, nothing has changed with her historical novels. Still flaky and almost child-like heroines. This was a long and ridicules story. Sorry Julie, I have out grown your historical novels. I still think she is a talented writer, her contemporary novels are not that bad. Sorry . ):"
22046,-1,For beginners...,"I have been a exercise dvd junkie for years, Kettlebell dvds also. Although I like the exercises presented, I have some issues with her form. I know from personal experience, if you don't have your form correct, you can cause injury to other parts of your body as I did with my knees. Also, if you're advanced, you will be working out without her instruction, as she only does the beginner workout with you. Normally, trainers will either let beginners know when their time is up and continue on with the advanced exercisers. Lisa stops working out at the beginners level, which leaves you still working out by yourself, hopefully, finishing in time for the next exercise. I did pick up some good exercises but don't use this dvd as often as I would have liked. I will be sending it down the ""resell"" road."
22047,-1,Not worth the time or money,"I purchased this dvd hoping for a complete kettlebell workout. This is not that video. She has 4 different segments or ""workouts."" You would have to do all 4 just to feel that you had worked out with a kettlebell at all. The exercises are very short with very few repetitions and the breaks in between the exercises are way too long. The instructor states that she is really feeling it and her cardio was up. I was really bored and not feeling any sweat or cardio at all. Save your time and money and skip this kettlebell dvd."
22050,-1,Frustrating,"I am deeply disappointed and thoroughly frustrated with the perplexing and redundant complications of the book. It is true that the author, apart form being a very fertile textbook writer, has a very thorough approach when it comes to derivations and mathematical explanations. However, in doing this, he obscures the physics contained. The author insists on very thorough mathematical explanation without reference to intuition, making the topic more about mathematical derivations then physics. The mathematics is not complicated, it is just tedious. He does not leave anything to be done by the reader, turning the learning process into an effort of understanding how the author thinks and how he thinks you should understand the topic."
22059,-1,Disappointment,"Followed the instructions on fluffing, still the pillow is terrible. Purchased a pair of down pillows from Sam's for $16/pair, this horrific investment cost around $45 and I don't use it at all. Stay away."
22060,-1,Too Warm or Too Cold,Looks great. Fits our space. Holds right number of bottles for us. But temperature either 40 or 60 degrees. Neither good for storing wine. Cannot get the temperature we want. Would send it back. But major undertaking for me--too heavy and bulky. Keeping as extra frig.
22064,-1,soundtrack,can any body please tell me who made the music for the soundtrack?i want to know please tell me.thanx
22066,-1,British DVD doesn't work on US machines,The DVD did not play on my American DVD player. It would really nice if this compant pointed out that this DVD is British and not calibrated for US DVD machines.It was a DVD for an assignment that set me back with little time to find a copy to complete my assignment. I will not order from this compant again.
22069,-1,6 foot not 6 inches,Amazon sent wrong cable to me twice... the picture and description clearly show a six inch cable. Original order and replacement were wrong.
22076,-1,Don't Believe the Hype,"Jim the Boy is terribly overrated, with a cast of cardboard characters and a wooden tone. Apparently many critics don't know how to distinguish between spare, basic prose and dumbed-down bad writing. The author is probably laughing his way to the bank, especially now that a sequel has been published. I'll just let them fall all over themselves and take a pass. God forbid there should be a movie forthcoming."
22080,-1,Extremely Disappointed,"When compared to some of the other wonderful literature that is available for children, this book doesn't have a leg to stand on. It was poorly written and rather boring. (...)"
22086,-1,Little practical advice,"When you are thinking about starting your own business, probably the last thing you need is this sort of fluffy advice to become ""mature"", wear a suit, and heavily network. I was hoping for more solid information, like the virtues of incorporating rather than being a sole proprietor and other real concerns of a small business person. Plus the author's ""voice"" really irritated me. There are *much* better books out there on this subject."
22093,-1,Boring!,"This book is the most boring book that I ever read. I mean, all we see is this guy who has a broken leg, and who's trying to solve a mystery that occurs decades ago. What's the point?"
22098,-1,Ripped off.,"I recently bought these silk pajamas for my husband's birthday. Within a week, all the button fell off the top and the fabric frayed 2 - 3 inches wide along the seams in the pants along the thighs. I paid $160 dollars for these pajamas, more than silk PJs listed from other suppliers on Amazon, expecting I was buying quality. After a week's use, they are heading for the rag bag and I feel defrauded."
22099,-1,Bait and switch at its worst,"The product I received in no way resembles the Vanilla Fields cologne I've been buying for years. The bottle is not the same, but more important, the fragance is unfamiliar, and malodorous. Caveat emptor."
22100,-1,"It's not new, it's used","It arrived in an amazon box with cushion. Inside the perfume box was beat up and covered in something sticky. Oh, and about 25% of the perfume was already used."
22111,-1,Awful!,"I've not had paper jams or feed problems in ten years. Now they are back! In two months I have printed perhaps 100 sheets. Now there is a problem with 3 sheets out of 4. Every other HP printer that I have or have had feeds paper with no problem at all, but this one does not!"
22112,-1,Don't buy this printer!,The constant printer jams make this printer unusable! And don't buy the baloney that those of us having problems have not followed the manufacturer's directions. The thing jams with HP's own (expensive) paper no matter how many pieces of paper are in the tray.
22114,-1,"Doesn't scan, doesn't print!","I agree with the others here, HP are useless and I should have known better. Paper jams all the time using laser quality paper kept in a humidity controlled environment. Every copy you have to feed through manually.I couldjust about live with that but it doesn't scan either!! It says it'sscanning, it sounds like it's scanning - it even says image sent to the computer after scanning but do any images appear?? Do they heck!! Still under warranty, I've had a replacement unit and still the same and the HP techie team, (based in India!) can't help - it's going back!!"
22118,-1,In the immortal works of Monty Python,"RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY.When and if it works, it looks great.I wish I could rate this at NO stars because of the paper jam or out of paper issue. I guess it's come to the point where we have to beg, plead and pray just to get something to work as advertised. I purchased this a Wal-Mart for $50, so I would bet that American manufacturers are thinking that ""if they only spend 50 bucks, what did they expect?"" ""They should have paid more so it will work."""
22121,-1,worst paper feed ever,"It looks great, lcd screen with media card slots was nice touch..but what good is it if it can't take in any paper to PRINT ANY THING OUT ...I was able to get it to take in paper using exclusive HP paperand ONE PAPER at a time it works SOME TIMES.My first HP printer and it will be my LAST,when I run out of Ink on the darn thing, rather thanburning 60 bucks for INK I would buy a LEXMARK again."
22131,-1,Paper feeder stopped working after 2 months,"I bought this printer from Sam's Club, and it worked great for about 2 months. After that, the paper feeder was unable to recognize paper - in order to print anything, the paper had to be manually fed through the printer. Fortunately, Sam's was great and gave me a full refund. Buyer beware!I bought the Canon Pixma MP600 - we'll see how that one works."
22133,-1,Doesn't deserve any stars...,"This printer fails as a printer mainly because paper won't properly feed. HP helpdesk requests you to tap all paper, and put in 10~25 sheets only. This doesn't work. Feeding one sheet at a time manually has at best a 1/10 shot of success. Let's hope HP's refurb replacement printer is better."
22134,-1,Very dissatified with this *thing*,"This is the first review I have ever written, but I am so annoyed with this so-called printer that I had to add my 2 cents.My last HP printer lasted for over 5 years before giving up the ghost. I was happy with its preformance. This one I have had about 2 months and I am ready to throw it out the window.The paper feeding problem is VERY ANNOYING. I find I have to fiddle for many minutes to get it to recognize there is paper in the tray. Then once it does, it has a 50/50 chance of jamming!For HP to call it a printer is almost funny, because I have yet to have it just print without problems.I am in the market for a new printer after less than 2 months!"
22139,-1,Stay Away!!!,This COULD be a great printer except for the paper handling mentioned before. I will never purchase another HP printer.
22154,-1,does not work,This format does not work on ps3 or Xbox 360 so I was unable to view it. I tried to ask for a refund with no response. It is the European format. They need to state it better when it is like that.
22163,-1,Worst video game adaption for a move.,Some video game movies are great. Others are horrid. Super Mario Brothers goes beyond horrid! It seems as though nothing was thought out when writing the script for this movie and it does not resemble the game by Nintendo in anyway. If they had slapped a different name on this and changed the names of some of the characters I think this movie could have received 1.5 stars rather than just 1. There is nothing of value in this movie and I strongly suggest that you stay far away unless your looking for something to put yourself to sleep if you have insomnia.
22166,-1,Could have been better!,"I am a big fan of the Super Mario Brothers - the video game and the TV show. I had high hope for this movie, but boy what a waste of time this was. This movie sure give the Super Mario Brothers a bad name. If you haven't seen this movie, I envy you. Nothing like the game of the show. It NEVER should have been made; period."
22172,-1,What a disappointment,"From reviews I had thought RB would be a genuine thriller.The only thing I found thrilling was the realization after anhour or so that the film would soon be over. Can't understand why anyone would make the effort to mentally get into this film.I found it corny and I'm certainly glad I didn't pay for the DVDthat I watched. Everything about this film was heavy - heavy acting, heavy scripting. Heavy,heavy, heavy."
22176,-1,A waste of a good plot,"I thought that this movie was going to be scary, and terrifying. In the end, it was stupid and meaningless. The plot was good, but it was played out all wrong. It was a waste of a good 2 and a half hours and it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
22180,-1,Don't waste your time,I purchased this DVD with much enthusiasm only to find that it dose not play on my combo bluray/HD player.I send it back for replacement and it still would not play and had to finally return it all together.It seem from reading other reviews this is typical of this title (or series). Don't waste your time buying this DVD.
22197,-1,One of her worst - a cut & paste job,This is old articles from her magazine and the advice was not very good. There are better books.
22202,-1,Don't waste your time or money on this piece of JUNK!,"I won't go into an elaborate diatribe on just how terrible this product is. To sum it up, it's useless and was not market-ready. TiVo customer service and support is abominable, and the ""help"" they supply for this product is laughable. My son has been a network systems engineer for over 10 years, he had to come and try and get it to work. After a bit of fussing with it, the adapter was getting poor reception. The wireless router and modem are barely 30 feet from the TiVo box, with open space throughout. My laptop easily achieves 12Mbps without a hitch.For a goof, we moved the wireless router and modem to the kitchen table, and hooked it up to the laptop. Only then were we able to get a decent signal, with the wireless router about 8 feet from the TiVo box and network adapter. Several calls to TiVo got me canned, simple fixes to try. It works best when you throw it in the trash."
22204,-1,WHY?,"I have recently read this book (not out of choice) and I am at a loss to understand why Hardy wrote this and why anyone would willingly read this for ""fun"". I agree wholeheartedly with the author of ""Classically Boring"" as this book is complete excrement. People are always going on about how we should stop cutting down the rainforest etc. and if this is what all those trees are turned into, then I'm with them 100%."
22206,-1,Slow performance,I got one of these set up with 4 1TB disk in raid 5 giving me a total og 2.7 TB datastorage. But it is very unstable especialy when handling large or many files +100 MB. The connection is lost and copying has to be restarted.Also streaming runs very slow.When using the build in PnP the mashine hangs and has to be restartet.It is sad as the specs are great.
22208,-1,almost made me want to seek relief.,"I wish I would have rented it before i bought it! Now I am out 20 dollars for a crapy movie. man it Sucked! It was slow, no plot, BORING! The most boring movie this year! It made me feel like I had ADD and didn't want to pay attention anymore, it was so bad, don't waist your money on this one! it makes no sense at all! the best part was the sceanery in the woods! I'd won't be surprised if people kill themselfs after watching this crap!"
22214,-1,Boring,"This movie seems like an exploitation on an idea of what Kurt Cobain's last days may have been like. In the end, it is boring, long, slow, and completely ridiculous."
22219,-1,The worst movie I've seen ever! Awful!,"I have never been so compelled to review anything until I watched the movie Last Days yesterday evening. The movie was about absolutely nothing. The character who is supposed to be Cobain just mumbled, walked around, and passed out the entire movie. It was awful and a complete waste of my time. I was seriously angry after watching it, because I stayed up to watch it. How does this crap ever make it?"
22233,-1,An Insult to the English Language,"I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust."
22239,-1,A Bummer & An Insult to One's Intelligence,"I didn't like this book when I was a child. I don't like it as a an adult. It is a farce, plain and simple. The reviewers who panned it for its absurdity were right on target. This poorly written tale just constructs a nice little fantasy about a martyr instead of a real child and it sounds like ""Ozzie & Harriet Confront C.P."" Although the anecdotes about the aminmals were cute, the whole book is written in a condescending tone. The racist name that one rabbit was given was insulting. Read ""Karen"" and ""With Love from Karen"" instead as these books complement your intelligence instead of insulting it like ""Wren"" does. I didn't like this book at all. I agree -- ""Wren"" really is for the birds."
22244,-1,Dumping it down the drain,"This product obviously works well for most but it made my twins extremely fussy, gassy, and spit up like crazy. Not only did I hate to see them screaming with discomfort, but it was the hardest day I've had yet as a new mom to twins. Yes, I said ""day."" I took MMP as directed for only one day. The babies fussed all day and night leaving me no time to pump to even see if there was an increase in supply. I cut out the MMP and went back to plain fenugreek the next day and everyone is happy again. I'm pretty sure it's the blessed thistle that caused the issues. I tried previously adding blessed thistle capsules to my supplementation routine and we had similar issues, although not anywhere near the degree as with MMP. I hate leaving a negative review for a product so widely loved and touted, but I didn't find anything about effects similar to my experience so I felt the need to share."
22245,-1,"Unless your kids are over 12, leave them home with Grandma","There is nothing, I repeat, NOTHING in Italy that would appeal to a child under the age of 12. This book is a waste of money. If your kids are under 12, take them to Disneyland/World and save yourself a lot of money and whining."
22246,-1,substandard quality,"I have ordered this item 3 times, while the shape makes cutting easier than normal end cutters such as channel lock the quality of the metal blade is not good. The item listing claims to be for heavy use and all3 I ordered chipped within a couple days of use making the tool useless."
22254,-1,Of Mice and Men,"Three crucial pages were torn from the book: The ""Introduction by Susan Shillinglaw""(Director of the Steinbeck Research Center); ""Suggestions for Further Reading""; and ""A Note on the Text."" Since I was reading the book for a class discussion, these items would have aided me greatly during the discussion period."
22255,-1,of mice and men,I read of mice and men because I had to for school otherwise I would have never read this book I thought it was going to be boring and nothing changed it was still boring. The story is about lenny and george and they travel around from job to job trying to make money. Lenny likes to touch things and always gets them kicked out of ever town they go to. Then they have a plan to get their own land and stop working for everyone else. This was a boring book. It was written by John Steinbeck.
22256,-1,AHHHH!!!!!!,"I had to read this book for my 9th grade English class and i must say this is the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life! it had the worst ending possible, I had to keep putting it down because it had the slowest plot in the world and had very flat characters. (Amazon suggests you buy this with To kill a Mockingbird which was the other book that was required for me and I highly suggest that book because it is a great book and one of my all time favorites.) AHHHHH!!!!! this book made me soo mad. They killed of my favorite character!!! and george did it how could he do that! Slim was my other favorite and so was candy but even Slim wasn't cool in the end. I hated this book so much. Don't read this its bad. Read to Kill a Mocking Bird its good. If you want to read something of John Steinbecks read the Grapes of Wrath."
22259,-1,"If you like John Steinbeck, you are insane, please seak help","This book was quite possibly the worst book i've ever had to read. No wait, the worst ever was The Pearl! What is wrong with Steinbeck? Why does he feel he needs to kill main characters? I would seriously recomend that you never read this book ever. If you have to for highschool, I feel extremely sorry for you. In cnclusion I just have to say George, just let Lennie tend the Frickin' rabbits and Kino, throw the pearl away already!"
22266,-1,Worst Movie Ever,"This is the most painful 85 minutes that you will ever sit through. The movie sucks. Nothing about it is funny, just stupid. I think I could make a better movie with my camera phone. stupid."
22277,-1,Truly awful!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read some reviews here and elsewhere that sounded positive, but honestly this film was AWFUL. My friend and I seriously discussed leaving after the first 20 minutes (somthing I have never done before), but decided to stick it out and hope that it would get better. It did, but only marginally. I ended up wishing that I had walked in the first place and not wasted my time and $9.00 on this sea of stupid lines and pointless ""plot"". It was insulting to both Hawaiians and Trans-gender people and most of all was NOT FUNNY, truly. I like Drew Barrymore, and Adam Sandler when he is playing a character with a brain in his head--and there is chemistry between these actors(...). Rent The Wedding Singer instead. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY--if you are over the age of 11 this film is too immature for you. And if you are under the age of 11 you will be bored."
22283,-1,Beware this version,"This version of the film, from ROAN, should be avoided. The hour and 41 minute original is here chopped to an hour and 30 minutes. A mutilated film is no bargain at any price."
22288,-1,NO!!!!!!!,THIS TOY ISNT APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR GROWING CHILDREN AS THEY TEND TO SEND THE WRONG MESSAGETO CHILDREN(OR AT LEAST MOST)THAT CHILDREN SHOULD DRESS LIKE US BRATZ. NO! PARENTS SHOULDN'T ALLOW THEIR KIDS TO DRESS LIKE SLUTS SO DON'T BUY THIS DOLL! THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING IS THAT THESE DOLLS ARE IN THEIR BABY STAGE OR ATLEAST SO BUT THEY DARE DRESS SO SKANKILY!
22289,-1,No Thanks-But Barbie is Cool!,"I like baby dolls, but not this one. I love Phoebe and Roxxi, so maybe I would get the big baby versions of those, but no other big Bratz babyz. This doll is not soft, so so much for hugging and cuddling it. It's kind of cute, but I would get big baby Phoebe and Roxxi only.As for your FALSE LIES about Barbie, people are still buying them, Mattel HAS NOT given up, and Barbie will still be aroundfor years to come! I love both Barbie and Bratz and nothing willchange that!"
22293,-1,Thong on a doll recommended for a 3yr. old???,This is completely wrong. What type of person would give their 3yr old daughter a doll that is wearing thong underwear. I was blown away when I figured this out.Never would I recommend this doll!
22298,-1,Shameless Self-Promoter,She's featured on Time Warner cable commercials in West Tennessee. Her voice is actually quite irritating and the fact she is promoting this CD on an ad in this manner is a huge turn-off.
22299,-1,I gave it a chance but....,"The only reason I am writing this is because of that Time Warner commercial that keeps playing on TV was driving me insane! Now I mute the sound every time it comes on. I kept thinking, ""Why are they showing this local musician on this ad?"" Then I found out VC is a very popular singer, so I gave this CD a chance by listening to the preview clips above (maybe the ad did not do her justice, I thought). Well, the same weak,thin, and out-of-tune voice is still there. If you're over 14 years old and like this music, consider yourself tone-deaf (I'm a classically trained guitarrist who has played longer than VC has been alive, BTW). I think she does have some ability on the piano (I'm assuming that's her on the piano), though."
22303,-1,PIECE OF S***!!!,"I thought this was suppose to be the authentic headband, instead they sent a bootleg one that looks like s**t!! My 4 year old cousin could make a better looking bootleg headband than this.save your money and buy some sheet metal, get someone to cut it, then get them to imprint the symbol and scratch, then glue it on to some black faric"
22315,-1,Why?!,"Who buys and listens to his stuff?! I got this CD as a gift and must say I was very disappointed to hear that this is what America likes? His voice sounds so average ""broadway musical"" and not outstanding at all. My bet is he can thank American Idol that he sells any albums at all."
22320,-1,What is the world coming to?,Clay Aiken stinks! He is a manufactured 'pop star' whose facial expressions on American Idol made him look constipated!These songs are cliched and over-sung. Let's hope Ruben's effort is better than this sentimental rubbish
22329,-1,HAHAHAHAHAHAHA,"I'm sorry if any of you teen enjoy this lispy southern high school reject like 'em but i think it's all crap...don't get me wrong, i appreciate all forms of music and clay does have an ok singing voice but his style belongs on broadway doing a musical...he would be the BEST Sandra Dee on Grease i'm sure...it's funny to me how you can all like him because of a show..."
22330,-1,WIMPY!!,"Sorry Clay, I kept an open mind...but this CD is a corny, wimpy collection of out-dated pop. Clay should have stayed the red-haired, freckle-faced, 4-eyed christian singer that he once was. They have turned him into to a blonde, spiky haired howdy doody. My friends and I say......""CLAY NO WAY""!!!!!"
22339,-1,When a good voice meets bad music,"This album is a complete waste of Clay's voice. All I can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad Air Supply meets bad Barry Manilow. I can't understand what motivates these outstanding reviews for a album that's not worthy of them. These songs are about exciting as Muzak. Except if Clay's music was playing in elevators, I would be forced to take the stairs. I hope by the next release Clay has the music to complement his voice."
22344,-1,What a shame! What a waste! What sabotage!,"This CD is a spectacular disappointment. Clay has a huge, pure voice, and this CD works hard to cancel it out. Overproduced and underbalanced, every song is marred by a pervasive, tinny whitenoise, as if the drummer was told to keep the cymbals hissing through every song. This fuzzes up Clay's pure, clear tone, and cancels out every nuance of his emotional and musical resonance. It's as if the producer/arrangers didn't trust his voice to carry. What idiots. Clay seems like a smart kid; hopefully he's smart enough to choose another producer for his next CD."
22345,-1,Yuck,"Clay Aiken's bombastic, over the top singing style is bad enough to make Baby Jesus cry. If you're not a tween or a demented middle-age soccer mom, I recommend you pass on buying this album.Patooey."
22351,-1,Disappointed but still a fan.,"Can't hide my disappointment with this CD. I was looking forward to it, especially after attending the Idol concert in Raleigh. Unfortunately on this CD Clay is overpowered by background singers. There is also no diversity. Most of the songs sound the same to me. As an older fan I was hoping for some classic numbers like those Clay sang on the TV series. I won't be listening to this CD again. Hopefully whoever is responsible for it will learn from the experience and can produce something which will let Clay shine and reach out to his entire audience on his next CD."
22378,-1,Good Try,"This is at best, a good try for a first CD. But, I was somewhat dissapointed with the selection of songs as well as with the vocal arrangements. The vocals could be a lot stronger coming from a talented singer, such as Clay. I think a lot of people are buying this CD and making a lot of hype because they are glad to see someone who does not fit the mold make it big. I'm sorry, I have to agree with the critics. ""He should stick to show tunes""."
22384,-1,just ok,"Clay is ok but he's no Fantasia or Ruben, and never will compare with them, sure his fan's say he's the true AI, but all I ask is where is his million dollar contract that they give to the winner's, sure we all know about clays padded sell's,(what else is new) but where is his industry nom, did they forget about him, it look's that way, maybe one day his writers will write him some desent songs, that people other than his over zealious fan's can say there ok, but that's about all you can say about clay aiken's music is it's just ok, anything else would be a lie."
22386,-1,clay is such a joke,"he might start rapping on his next cd and chances are you might hear him, ruben and pharrell do a joint together anyway clay's an okay singer but ruben was better too bad they got rid of frenchie davis to quote funkadelic the girl is bad."
22393,-1,not worth the money,"My son really wanted this toy, he recieved it as a gift. The tower falls off if you look at it wrong, I will have to epoxy it to the base. It is expensive and does not come with any teen titans. Buy the figures and build your own tower/fort for them."
22394,-1,Teen Titan Tower falls apart,"This toy is absolutely terrible. I gave it one star, only because zero is not an option. My son really wanted this toy, and when he got it, he played with it for about 5 minutes, and walked away. Even a four year old can see how lame this toy is. It comes with a trigger that is supposed to eject some kind of orange ramp to launch a car. Nice concept, except the thing doesn't come out all the way, so my son ends up pulling the thing out. There are missiles that are supposed to attach to the side according to the instructions, they don't. The tower keeps falling off of it. All around, I can't believe how poorly designed this toy is for the money. You would think I bought it at the dollar store or something. I would urge all who consider buying this toy, to talk your kid into something else. IT'S TERRIBLE!!!"
22400,-1,TOTAL LET DOWN - FULL OF ERRORS,"Book is incomplete and full of errors, even simple errors where toString is in the code and not used properly and throws an error - he left off the ""()"". And we are supposed to learn from someone who can not use toString? The code from web site does not compile per book instructions. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this, no matter what the paid-reviewers say. This is one of the worst written book, code fragments and no full listing of code. The site provides code that does not compile correctly with vague insrtuctions as if it were going to actual work. Stick with O'Reilly series. Please Ted Husted, find another profession..... ( I picked 1 star because zero was not an otpion)"
22412,-1,You really shouldn't believe everything you read!,"To the reviews that are claiming this book is the absolute truth, how do you know? You have a Uncle here that has not talked to this kid in over 12 years? Was not in the picture when the kid was hanging out with Mr. Jackson. You have a family here that extorted money from Michael jackson plain and simply. Thats why this kid now an adult refused to testify in the 2005 court case. To the readers who really believe this book ask yourself if my child was molested would I take $20 million and let the person run free to molest others? I for sure wouldn't! Food for thought!"
22414,-1,Do not be deceived!,"This version of ""Beowulf"" should NOT be compared, at all, to the original text of ""Beowulf"". Students should not be taught that THIS story, as re-created by Robert Nye, is reflective of the ""Beowulf"" written about 1000 AD. The story developed and shared for hundreds of years is characterized by Christian concepts and ideals. This version, written by Robert Nye, reflects our societies overwhelming desire to rewrite history, de-Christianizing it as they go along. Robert Nye has replaced the Christian God of the original ""Beowulf"" with the mythological Viking god ""Odin"". The original ""Beowulf"" tale supports the historical significance that Christian beliefs and ideas had on the overall society of England and throughout Europe. Robert Nye has done a great injustice in adjusting an historical document to reflect his own convictions, or lack thereof."
22440,-1,Sayin dis is good is a joke,"I mean after 2 good hits I thought I'd check dis out. Well just like every other bling, bling, pop rapper, the rest of the album just wasn't worth it. I mean I hate it when rappers use nice songs as hits but make the rest of the album garbage, just to make sales. I like no limit but I don't like this CD. I can't recomend this at all. Just pass on this, unless u r a die hard sillk fan."
22449,-1,Cheap Stuff,Not of Good quality.It's not even worth for that price.Packaging is also not good.The pictures are misleading and they do not look like that.
22451,-1,not worth it,"do not buy these shirts, not worth the money, certainly not worth bill blass label, very poor style and stitching and fabric."
22457,-1,This Sucks,I waited all week for this over priced shirt. I only bought it because I couldn't find another button down shirt in eggplant and I needed the color for an event this week. The shirt arrived and they sent me the wrong style shirt. Its a polo shirt. Doesn't even look like the picture. Now I'm screwed for the event this week. Hella Lame.
22459,-1,OMG I am having terrible Iron Maiden flashbacks,"Just when I thought it could get any worse than Iron Maiden's Rock in Rio or Dance of Death tour dvds, the Scorpions appeared to have hired the same camera, film and editing crew of those aforementioned releases. A great performance no doubt but the editing makes this unwatchable. Just an overpriced dvd to play when the tube is turned off."
22474,-1,I'm looking for a different router,"I'm using a Mac and a PC with this product. From the start, I could not get it to set-up like the directions instructed. I had to bring it to my local Res-Net office on campus for them to set-up. The big complaint I have with this router is the connection with the computer needs to be reset nearly every day for me, sometimes three times a day (PC and Mac). Depending on how heavy my internet usage is."
22482,-1,What a Disappointment,"I grew up on the Narnia Books and thought The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was well adapted to the big screen. However, Prince Caspian seemed to try to add all of the adventures of current box office hits rather than going with the strength of the story. Everything seemed too over the top: the battlescenes, the attempt at a love line between Caspian and Susan, the lack of quality character improvement. Urf. The scenery and cinematography don't make up for the lack of substance. If they can't pull it together for Dawn Treader, this will be a movie series to miss..."
22488,-1,So very sad,"When publishers abridge classics such as The Wind in the Willows they must be very respectful. And they should not make their own determinations of what a child can and cannot absorb or enjoy. It is very sad that they cut ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" from this edition. Children can and will get something valuable from such contemplatve texts, but only if we allow them access!"
22495,-1,Don't bother,I was excited to receive this book. I am a red head and have an infant son with red hair too. This book was very boring. I hung in there hoping it would get better but soon found myself skipping pages. It did not hold my interest and didn't seem to make much sense. I have a red headed girlfriend that I was going to pass it on to but after reading it I have changed my mind. The cover is attractive so therefore it makes a good coffee table book.
22497,-1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this product because of the stellar reviews, but this product turned out to be TERRIBLE. When you apply this product to your face, it doesn't absorb into your skin...it just sits there and leaves you with a white mask. And who would go out in public wearing a white mask on their face?!?!?! For some reason no one mentioned that on here, but if you go to other websites (drugstore,com- I can't use a period because they might remove the link) and read this products reviews you will see what I'm talking about. Trust me when I say do not waste your money on this product; Neutrogena's Ultrasheer sunblock is the best sunblock for your face out there."
22500,-1,not worth any money,you may not take me seriously because i am a teenager but i am a big fan of the harry potter books. larry potter pails in comparison to harry potter and basically any other book it also uses similar termonoilgy and is a copycat that is why i even brought up harry potterso dont waste your time reading this book life isnt long enough
22503,-1,not very good..,i could only read an hour of this poor paraphrase. ive read many paraphrases and this is one of the worst.
22505,-1,Very disappointed,"This was an adorable bird feeder that was supposed to deter squirels, but it didn't sending the feeder crashing to the ground."
22512,-1,Missing content,"This episode is missing the Kristen Wiig gold commercial parody. I don't know why it got edited out, but it's not there. Don't buy this."
22513,-1,BUY THE COMPLETE CD!,"I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS CD AT BORDERS YESTERDAY AND I COULDN'T FIND IT. I REMEMBERD IT BEING LIKE 22 DOLLORS OR SOMETHING. SO I BOUGHT THE 35 DOLLOR COMPLETE 2 DISK RECORDING. I AM SOOOOOOO GLAD I DID. THERE WERE SO MANY GOOD SONGS THAT WERE ON THE COMPLETE CD THAT THEY TOOK OUT FOR THE HIGHLIGHTS. IF YOU REALLY LIKE EVITA AND WOULD LIKE TO HEAR A GOOD RECORDING, GET THE COMPLETE ORIGINAL BROADWAY OR THE CONCEPT RECORDING. I WOULDN'T BUY THIS OR EVEN THE ORIGINAL LONDON CD. THEY'RE JUST TOO SHORT."
22515,-1,A Magazine for Kids Not For Professionals,"Purchased a digital subscription and regret it. A magazine for kids who like to look at pretty pictures. Unfortunately 95 percent fluff. Very little solid info. Lacking instructive content, but often has pretty photos of cars and of pretty girls, if that is what you like. Mostly advertising, I wouldn't wast the money on it again."
22525,-1,Save your money,"Should have read the box before I purchased. Lots of early stooges, cartoons, and Curly Joe Stooges...not the shorts we all know and love. Should have known better...the price was too good! Looks like it's $100 bucks for the stuff I really wanted!"
22527,-1,3 stooges 75th anniversary dvd set,"It came damaged, I sent it back to be delivered in 2 to 3 days and still have not received a replacement. The last time I emailed him, he said he did not get it back and that was after 11 days. I think it was damaged before he even sent it and thought I would keep it because of Christmas, now he is just ignoring me. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!! I would like my money back plus what I paid for shipping twice."
22536,-1,boring,This movie was really boring. It was slow and uninteresting. the man who did this movie is the one trying to bring back the Zatoichi series. I have not seen the new Zatoichi movie yet but this movie gives me great doubts about how good it will be. His other movies may be good but this one is a definite time waster. Save yourselves.
22552,-1,washout,"This was given to me as a gift so I am not ungrateful . However the 600 mm waterproofing it states is not even a minimum allowance for being water repellent . I would not chance this thing in a light sprinkle and the bottom stitching is so loose you can see daylight between some parts. There is no logic in spending time seam sealing this tent ... the seams would be the only thing keeping the water out, the rest would come right through the fabric walls itself.This is kind of an expensive tent ... you wouldn't have to look too far to find a smarter option . If it does not have at least a 1000 mm rating then you will get wet ...and that is a fact . I cannot even image what this thing would do in the wind ... the thin poles are worse than the usual ones they put on the cheapest tents.You have my sympathy if you pay over 30.00 dollars for this tent ."
22557,-1,not worth it,I bought this tape in hopes of helping me out in school more.When watching this tape the camera position was bad on one side.The lady in the video was repeating everything again and a again.I didnt learn anything out of this video i think it was a waste of money.
22558,-1,Poor Design,I would not buy this product or reccomend it. It is designed poorly and the different attachements don't stay on the charger. Disapointed withmoney spent
22560,-1,Destroyed the Paint on my Spoiler Fin,"I followed the instructions to the letter, mounted the rack, put the bike on it, motored around, used the bike, put it back on, got home, took the bike off and discovered the coarse fabric and hardware rubbed the paint off my spoiler fin in two places. There were scratches where the hooks go in to the side of the trunk. The only way I could get the sides taut was to have the hooks in contact with the edges of the spoiler fin.If I were a new car owner, I'd be all lawsuity and Consumer Reportsy. But, my car is 9 years old and I touch park, so I just feel I need to opine here as a Cautionary Tale.If you have a new car, don't use this. Get something that mounts off your trailer hitch. The only reason I got this was that it was the only trunk mount rack available for my car. My car does not have a trailer hitch. I cannot use a roof mount because I cannot lift a bike over my head.In a nutshell. OK for a beater. Not OK for a new car."
22561,-1,Lost my Bike,The fasteners on this thing are awful. I was driving down the highway and after going over a bridge the bike flew off my car because the fasteners stripped and came undone.Spend more money on a nicer bike rack. Now I have to get a new bike and rack instead of paying maybe 50 bucks more and still having a bike.
22565,-1,Horrible read don't waste your time!!,"This book proves to be unconstitutional, I cannot believe John Yoo teaches at UC Berkeley, I would be ashamed to call myself a professor and a patriot writing a book like this."
22571,-1,Totally disappointing,"Sorry to say, although Roland Barthes is an icon to some. This short book is self-indulgent, unintelligible, and therefore useless. The author is far more interested in himself than he is interested in the subject."
22572,-1,Heavy going,"It is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly. I cannot be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator, but it certainly does not measure up to this criterion. It may be of interest to photography academics, but I doubt if a photographer will get much out of it that is useful."
22573,-1,wanted a soundtrack not an Elton John record,"Some of the other reviews are correct, this is a great Elton John record. But I didnt buy it to listen to Elton John, I bought it to get the music from the movie.I am very disappointed. While Elton John is indeed a good artist, that is not why I wanted this. The makers of this cd have cheated me and anyone else who is a fan of the movie. They have set this up as a soundtrack to get your money, but instead it is nothing more than an Elton John music.Which is why it only gets 1 star from me."
22579,-1,Disappointing and shallow account of the ordinary heros WWII,"I was quite let down by the lack of real substance and information in the accounts. It is a great subject but the shallow treatment did not hold my interest. Ambrose's Citizen Soldiers is much, much better."
22580,-1,"Should have been a short story, too repetive","The story was good for the first three chapters, then it was the same story over and over with new names. Highly overrated."
22596,-1,"Really, all this just to sell books","Listen, I like Tom Brokaw as a journalist, but this book was such an obvious pander in order to sell books. It worked, he sold a lot of copies. By calling the WWII generation the ""Greatest Generation"", it gives anyone born within the general area the idea that they are great. Brokaw doesn't bother to make a distinction between the ""GI Generation"", or the people who actually marched off the war, fought a war, came home, built a middle class and thrived. And those of the ""Silent Generation"" who came a long a little later and were big on conformity in the 1950's, didn't suffer in the war or the Great Depression. I don't think just because you're old, you're great, and the author simply would not make the distinction in order to sell copies."
22597,-1,Redundant and repetitious.,"""Tom...don't quit your day job.""The Greatest Generation is both cliche-ridden and self-servng.This book is merely a platform for Mr. Brokaw's ultra-left leanings.Tom never tells us what some of these heroes think of our present ""commander in chief."""
22598,-1,Now we know why he is a newscaster,"Brokaw delivers a lightweight, sketchy, collection of interviews with World War Two vets, which unfortunately has made him a lot of money and spawned equally mediocre sequels.There are an infinite number of far superior books covering the same ground."
22599,-1,Contains Transfats,The nutritional information on the packages I got do not match what is on the website here. Each bag has 4g of trans fats. Why the discrepancy? Why do they need to add that to sunflower kernels?
22614,-1,Waste,"How sad is it that this CD was released. A supposed ""Hiatus"" yes. They just released this to cash in on their fans, and so no one will forget them. How can we when they are shoved in our faces at every possible moment, even when they are supposedly taking a break! So until they decide what they want from their careers, they will still manage to be a cash cow for their fans. Elsewhere, these remixes are far from anything good. Just another sad piece of plastic which isn't worth the time of day...Why don't they just take time off, I mean really take time off, and come back with something that is a good album? After SURVIVOR, I have no hopes for this disapointing group which was once good. This only adds to my disapointment."
22616,-1,"Dear Lord, What Happened Here?","It used to be that when artists released a new album, they released a NEW album. Now we get live albums, useless Holiday recordings, and shoddily-made remix releases. This album falls into the third category, and as far as remix albums go, the results are catastrophic. Predictible hip-hop remixes of singles we've heard a zillion times before abound, while the FEW house mixes are as flat as soda left at room temperature for hours. Listen, nobody says you can't do a remix album, but give the listeners some variety and a groove. I actually like Destiny's Child, but after ""The Writing's on the Wall,"" their music is getting more and more vanilla. Should you feel the urge to get this CD, just say ""no, no, no."""
22617,-1,Buy 883476028965 instead.,"As anyone can clearly tell from the reviews, this bundle (which is three existing DVDs shrink-wrapped together with a sheet of paper bearing the ""cover"" image rubber cemented to the front -- not a space-saver) only contains the rated cuts of FEAST II and FEAST III. However, TWC has seen fit (finally) to fix this decision by quietly releasing a new DVD. The revised set comes in a single, regular-width DVD case, and all three discs are the Unrated versions. The UPC for that version is 883476028965, and it can be found at many Wal-Marts (right now anyway) for $10. If you want a space-saving, all-Unrated way to get the FEAST movies for cheap, track down that one and pass on this one."
22620,-1,Great music disappointingly mastered,This is a great band let down by odd noise reduction. The filtering keeps flipping on and off in the middle of songs making it hard to enjoy the music. There are much better ways to present historical material. Very disappointing!!
22622,-1,Well....,"While he was filming another movie in Toronto, we went out and bought this horrible movie so we could get him to sign it. You know what he wrote? ""I Hate this Movie. Greg Kinnear"""
22627,-1,Inner pot peels off!!,"I fell for these great reviews, but found out there is really nothing special about this rice cooker except for the price and the reviews to justify spending more for the same thing.After a couple of months of use, the inner pan peels off, had bad scratches. Talk about the worst customer service.I wish someone I've read a more truthful review on this product prior to buying.Save your money."
22628,-1,Less than Impressed,"We purchased the acclaimed, top end NS-ZCC-10 Neuro fuzzy rice cooker. We expected perfect rice because after all it incorporates the latest software and heating technology. We are very disappointed. Rice is overcooked and clumpy. We've tried to troubleshoot (more water, less water etc), but you know, the bottom line is that this cooker does not deliver excellent rice. We got better results with our no-tech, aluminum $50 plug in rice cooker.Very disappointed. I do not recommend you spend your money on this product."
22630,-1,What a Joke!,"Wow, after reading all the rave reviews here I expected a great rice cooker. It was anything but...I suppose if I had an hour to wait for my rice it would've proven to be the best rice. 40 minutes plus is the time stated by the directions, I figured cooking one cup would be less, but after 20 minutes the cooker had barely warmed up....I quickly got my ""cheap"" Hamilton cooker ($15) and voila, I had rice a few mintutes later.I'm sure that for those with time or with the time to pre-set cooking time for completion, this is a great machine, but for those that just want to cook some rice quickly and have dinner, don't waste your money. Will be sending this back asap."
22632,-1,Broke in 10 months.,I was very happy with this rice cooker until the very fragile rubber grommet on the lid tore. They do not sell the part. Beware. It is great but it will not last long this feature makes it very very vulnerable. I had it for 10 months before the fragile grommet tore now it no longer makes good rice. The cost to repair it makes it useless because I would just have to repair it again in 10 months. This is not a rice maker for anyone who cooks a lot of rice it just won't last.
22640,-1,"Ordered 2, both failed the first day",Found the product not to be durable. Both balls split in the first day of use so they seem too fragile for the intended use.
22647,-1,Small,"I wanted to use this as my desk chairNopeIt was too small and was like I was sitting in the floor.Also, the pump they provide is horrible...pleas to be pumping for another 20 min just to inflate."
22650,-1,Huh???,This is very odd. In 1998 Garth Brooks had success when he put out a box set with a similiar theme. However for some artists that kind of treatment doesn't work and it falls flat. I like Toby Keith but this box set is just a way for a record company to make money buy repackaging three CD's (None of which are any good or have any worth) and make an extra buck. It's just sad.
22654,-1,Great content...Poor format,"These are great lectures by Spurgeon, but the format of the book is very poor. It is a photo reproduction of one of the original editions and the type is VERY small and hard to read. There are other editions, Eerdmans for example, that are much better for a similar price."
22657,-1,Our unexpected wasted time,I am a very big Maureen McKade Fan . I have got 2 of every book that she has . I waited so long to read this one . But when I got it I sat down to read it and I have to say I was crying at the end becuse it was so painful to read . It was a very disapointing night . This is one book that I will not be keeping :-( It was very laging in many areas . Along with unbelivable . I am usally able to loose my self in her books and forget any kind of day the world has put me threw but not this one. You know it a great book if you laugh and rut on the people in it but this one you sipmly can not.
22658,-1,here we go again!,"holy crap once again this faggot NElly comes out with a horrible album, omg dont get this, paul wall song is whack, the only good song to listen to is Nasty Girl. Nelly is still whack and always will be, listen to true rappers like NWA, Nas, Eminem, Dre, not these bubble gum rappers like Mike Jones, slim thug etc.Seems to me like hip hop is getting worse and worse every year, where the days where people would talk about important things rather then cars and girls.This nelly guy collaborated with NSync WTF!! and Tim Mcgraw also WTF! XTINA, Fat Joe, Lil Flip all horrible people and yet he does it. I dont think he cares about what his fans think, wish he wouldve stuck with something like Country Grammer only thing but this CD is just horrible dont get it!(...)"
22671,-1,THE TRANSFER QUALITY WAS THE SECRET,"WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! The transfer quality of this DVD ""SECRET AGENT"" is discusting. This is the 21st century, the digital age. With the latest transfer machines on the market there are no excuses for studio's churning out rotten transfers. Before you buy this disc, ask yourself if you can sit through an unwatchable image. Good old ""Hitch"" would turn in his grave if he knew what was happening to his precious movies. A warning should be posted about the rotten transfer of this disc and I have just done it! DON'T BUY IT. DEMAND BETTER QUALITY!"
22684,-1,"Once again, the G rating only good enough for OUTSIDE USA!!!","As with every Nick movie from 2002 onwards, this movie is rated PG. However, some countries, like the U.K. for example, has a G equivalent. Come on! We hardly get to see G rated movie in theaters anymore! There are lots of PG movies for families that are innocent and don't deserve a high rating. Maybe it's just a filthy trick for the MPAA to encourage children to read a book or play a sport? B***S**T! I like movies, and kids like movies. I don't it when parents worry. Please, MPAA? Let our country's children see a stinkin' movie, will ya?"
22685,-1,"Really bad, boring, stupid movie.","I had to watch this in my band class when we had a substitute teacher because some teenagers are so immature they watch SpongeBob. I don't watch TV at all, and was not expecting to see this movie.The ""humor"" in this movie ranges from forced (the whole ""Goofy Goober"" thing, a Chuck E. Cheese-like establishment, only with peanutes) to disturbing (SpongeBob's mentally challenged friend Patrick Star flies into a ceremony naked with a flag in his butt). The only good part is when SpongeBob and Patrick get drunk off ice cream. You know what would've been the perfect ending? Them getting arrested for underage drinking.Hey, I'd laugh."
22694,-1,Incomplete Content,I couldn't read this book because it is incomplete. There is something wrong with the content in the Kindle version.
22703,-1,Stupid,I bought these because I read a bunch of positive reviews but they really suck! They look like little pieces of tape and they barely remove any hair. I don't recommend this product to anyone.
22709,-1,rip off of the beatles,"what the hell is this. 5 loosers from enlgand trying to copy the beatles. i mean even there fans are so stuipid. i read one review which one of the oasis fans criticized thebeatles for being a rip off of OASIS. hello dude the beatles were 1963 and oasis is 1994. that should be enough to skip this album and get hte better of these clones THE BEATLES.r.i.P. JOHN LENNON, GEORGE HARRISONTHEY MUST BE TURNING IN THERE GRAVES"
22716,-1,Somewhat creative but thoroughly uninspired,This stuff is easily the most trite and cliche collection of prose on love and romance that I've ever read. I was expecting a good deal more. The writing seems to come from the mindset of an intellectually arrested suburban kid who hasn't experienced much of life or the world beyond his college campus and his few so-called love affairs.
22725,-1,Disjointed and full of typographic errors,"This was a big let down. The text was hard to follow. There were typographical errors everywhere, even on the first page. It looks like it was self-published. And probably self-editing, too. Save your money."
22729,-1,Very bad work by Elizabeth Speare review for Mr. Jones,"I think this book was boring. The only exciting part is the witch hunt. Most of the time they talked about polatics. If they wern't the were cring over petty grevences such as love. This is why this story was boring. The characters were annoying and obtuse, it was hard reading such a disgusting piece of lititure. Kit was such an unintelligent and snooty creature it was infurating to read about. The women were either self-centered or meek, the thought about love all the time. The men disscussed politics like a change would end the world and the men thought women were dirt. Nat and the cat were the only intellegent creatures. The characthers are just lacking perwsonality and intellegence."
22730,-1,The Witch that wasn't!,"I didn't like the book so much. The author put to much detail about one person, Kit. I knew all of the background information about Kit and everything she owned. But when Hanna Tupper was introduced I hardly knew anything about her. The author also didn't write in any excitement in the story. Everyone was just plain everyday individuals that did everyday things, like cleaning and spinning wool, making meals, cleaning the house and making clothes. It would have been interesting if the author had put Kit or some other character on an adventure or made it a fiction not a historical fiction. I don't know anyone who would like to read a book about just everyday, ordinary people, that are living ordinary lives. I want to read a book about some adventure or action."
22732,-1,Sigh,"This book is boring, but there are some ok parts. Don't read this book unless you have to. (...) Duh! Well, just don't read the book."
22744,-1,formatting and grammar...where is it?,"I have to admit that I have real problems with books that lack editing. This is a case in point. This book is difficult to read because of all the grammatical and spelling errors. Misplaced modifiers abound, too. Perhaps these errors have been corrected in subsequent printing, but at least, the one that I read had multiple errors on nearly every page. By the way, what is with spaces between paragraphs?Living on the North Coast as I do, I understand that people living in Ohio might find the story intriguing because of the subject matter; however, I found it difficult to enjoy the story because of the stilted conversations and implausible situations."
22747,-1,this album suxxxx,i could hardly stand to listen to this cd for more than five minutes.......it was so depressing and all the songs practically sounded the same.....get What's the story morning glory....it rocks
22755,-1,Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh maybe zero stars,What happens with Billy? It is the age what it has affected? Why it wants to be the cartoon of Sinatra?Honestly I continue waiting the return of great pop rock or good new wave rock of Glass Houses! But Billy sadly very sadly your music is made for old man's lovers of Sinatra. Argggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
22767,-1,Bad,"I don't know why one reviewer was so easy on Harrington. This book is just filled with errors. The web site isn't even available anymore. I am weary of these academics writing shoddy books,rife with errors,and then not even posting errata. STAY AWAY from this work."
22768,-1,Check part number with manufacturer to make sure it fits your vehicle,"Hey, I just wanted to let you know that there's something wrong with this listing. The ""Make Sure It Fits"" feature claims that #27302 will fit 2008 and newer E-150s, when the manufacturer claims that it does not and the proper one is #27344. Just call them to check and make sure that it actually fits your vehicle before you buy."
22782,-1,Not bad except ?,I was dissapointed to find that In Hell was not on any of the disc.I thought I was getting three movies but dont know what happened?
22786,-1,Not good,This is exactly the type of movie I'm trying to avoid. I have no idea how I came into possession of this but keep it far away from me.
22792,-1,This is a classic?,"I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it. I gave it an honest try, but I found this book unreadable. Maybe it's the translation from the original Greek text, but the sentence structure was very hard to follow. That being said, I found Zorba to be the type of person I would actively avoid spending any time with. Longwinded, drunken, sexist, and generally unpleasant. The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful."
22795,-1,worst investment,"Paid $300.00 for these about 5 years ago. After about 2 years of light use the ear pad vinyl fell apart and the head bar rubber padding became very sticky, comes off on your fingers and gets on everything. The replacement ear pads don't fit into the frame well and come out easily. The overall quality of sound and durability was very disappointing. I found several over-the-ear clip ear phones for under $10.00 to be superior in every way, including comfort, quality stereo, and I can use these cheaper ear phones when I'm sweating/exercising: don't try that with the Bose headphones! The Bose headphones didn't really cancel ambient noise. I don't use them anymore."
22797,-1,Poor Plastic Quality - Brakes Easily,"The sound quality is pretty good and battery life OK but the quality of the plastic used is REALLY poor, the structure complex and fragile. The head-band brakets will brake where it encloses the size adjustment ""sliders"". When that happens the headphone comes loose and the headset is unusable. The peace of plastic could be sold for a few dollars for a quick fix but in fact you have to get through the repair cycle nightmare and it costs a lot ... not a good deal, I am now looking for something different I can use while sleeping on the plane!"
22816,-1,It sucked go see War of the Worlds instead.,A lot of people told me that Batman Begins was good but I didn't like it. The first hour was too long and slow without Batman and it was all about Bruce Wayne training to becoming Batman and Batman did not show till the last hour. I'm not really a big fan of Liam Neeson though he's boring but what's really the point of this Batman movie there's nothing exciting about it. It really wasn't surprising to me. Christian Bale did make an excellent Batman and his voice really fitted as Batman but the whole movie was just not good. Wait for the DVD don't see it in theater. That's all I have to say. I thought War of the Worlds was better than Batman. Batman Begins really sucked.
22817,-1,I'm astounded,"at the ratings. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! Terrible acting, storyline and special effects! I actually threw it out. It makes Kilmer's/Clooney's versions look good and Keaton's looks like masterpieces!"
22823,-1,BATMAN BEGINS (2-Disc Deluxe Edition),I was suprise to recieve both dvds being DISC 1 - Feature Film & no Special Features.Your FEEDBACK features did not have any column with product defect !
22834,-1,Sales Brochure,"This book is absolutely useless. It only provided information normally found in a sales brouchure. There was no technical content. It only told you what you could do with SBS, not actually how to do it."
22852,-1,great if you are 14,"Yeah if you are between 14-16 you should love this crap cause thats what exactly it is. They call themselves Nashville Pussy but they really should call themselves White Trash cause they are not much more then that. There is nothing complex here its just the way you would expect something when you were, well 14. Loud, no real meaning,and they are not really all that fun either so i dont get it, it looks like because they mention Sex that means they are good? Wrong, they suck bigtime and there is no talent here and they are not saying anything here that hasn't been already said many many times, save your money"
22856,-1,Piece of Junk!!!,"Upon the third use, I started having the same problem as all the other 1-star people. The problem is with the auto input line sensing circuitry. Even with the auto-sensing switch in manual, the auto-sensing circuitry engages and disengages after every dynamic passage on a center channel home theater setup. When it engages and disengages the sound coming from the speaker connected to the amp also engages and disengages. I just ordered the Niles Audio SI-2125 to replace this piece of junk. Thanks Amazon for picking up the return shipping!"
22860,-1,WARNING - caught fire!,"Wow, pinch me is it really 2011 and we still have consumer electronics catching fire? Where is CE, UL, BS when you need them?Fortuitously I was next to the amp when the wisps of smoke started, followed by a crackling fire. The amp as spec'ed is decent and worked fine - until it decided to self-combust. The real concern is that this is configured as an 'auto-on' device, so it switches itself on when it receives an audio signal on the line-in: this means it is often going to be put somewhere out of the way and unnoticed - and that makes it a REAL fire hazard (as in 'burning the house down' hazard).So if i could give is a zero or negative star it would be duly awarded. Since now at least three reviews have indicated there is a real fire hazard, Amazon need to look carefully at what they are offering."
22867,-1,Totally crap,This book and his website is totally crap.He teach samp technique which annoy any serious customer.He keep saying about how he make millions of dollar.I think he is lying. He's website look like the one designed by secondary school boy
22869,-1,Tastes like sweaty gym socks,"I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me."
22874,-1,Just Plain Awful,"The first and second Robocop films were great. I loved the over-the-top action and humor elements in both films.Robocop 3 is a pure, unadulterated disaster. First off, it is way too tame (a PG-13 rating??!!). Second, the ""plot"" is completely ruined by the introduction of the ""cute little kid who is a computer whiz"" character, what a travesty! Third, the movie is actually boring; a boring Robocop movie! I could go on and on, but why bother.They dare to put this garbage on DVD?"
22875,-1,Junk,"When a movie has dialogue like, ""I thought your ninja was supposed to take care of RoboCop!"", it ain't gonna be Citizen Kane. It won't even be a good RoboCop movie. But if you must indulge, look for the strings holding up RoboCop when he flies. Yes, I said look for the strings holding up RoboCop when he flies."
22883,-1,Impossible to read,The print is so incredibly small that I couldn't even finish reading it (I am in my early 30's with perfect vision and do not use glasses). Seemed like a cute story if only the format was better.
22889,-1,Took Forever to Receive and is Missing Most of the Play!,"This book took almost two weeks to receive. Not to mention when I did finally get my copy in the mail, I was disappointed to see that the play skipped from Act II to Act V. Very disappointing."
22892,-1,GOT IT BUT....,"GOT IT ON TIME BUT....TAPE WAS SCRATCHY AND HARD TO WATCH. IT LOOKED LIKE THE TRACKING WAS OFF SO I TRIED TO ADJUST THE TRACKING SINCE THIS IS A VHS TAPE. IT DID NOT HELP, I GUESS THE TAPE WAS JUST TOO OLD AND SCRATCHY. THEY SHOULD HAVE REVIEWED IT BEFORE SENDING IT OUT. WELL, A LOSS FOR ME. WHAT CAN I SAY, WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT OF AN OLD VHS TAPE. NOT WORTH THE MONEY, VERY DISAPPOINTED."
22894,-1,I'd rather give up coffee.,"Dear Sirs,I purchased one of the Mr. Coffee CG12 coffeemakers in November of 2005. I have never seen a more poorly designed coffeemaker. What a piece of refuse! Because of its faulty design, it got coffee all over the countertop whenever it was brewing. I tried two of them and they both did the same thing. The whole design was slapdash. It should be taken off the market.After putting up with it for two months, I threw it in the trash and bought a Black and Decker. It was like going from a VW to a Rolls. Never again."
22898,-1,Terrible,"We sent this unit out for testing at a leading test lab and they found that it would only be able to clean a very small closet - that is if you are looking to remove airborne particles like dust, smoke or pollen. It could help somewhat with odors due to the ionization process but that is very difficult to measure.I found more specific testing information at the [...]"
22899,-1,No good,How do people say this works? I would say this picks up 1/10 of 1% particles...at the most candle soot! I have owned mine for 1.5 years.Save your hard earned cash and seek other filters with Hepa.My opinion applies to all ionic breeze filters
22901,-1,Does almost nothing,"Electrostatically removing particles works okay, but it requires a fan to move air over the grille. As others have mention consumer reports tested this product at it removed almost nothing from the air. It rated the lowest out of all the air cleaners they tested.So don't waste your money on this product. If you want an electrostatic air cleaner find one with a fan. Before you buy you should really go read the online Consumer Reports report because a lot of air cleaners don't work very well."
22902,-1,Bad for me too...Loved it at first and now it just doesn't turn on!,"I really should have looked up people's reviews prior to purchasing this unit. Mine just stopped working. I cleaned out the inside with air, I've been cleaning the insert all along and it just stopped! What a waste of money. Haven't tried to talk to Sharper Image about it yet but I'm not hopeful."
22912,-1,Deceptive,"This book professes to be for all people, but is in fact, just for the devoutly religious. I could not finish it because it was so faith based, it made me sick to my stomach. Maybe some people can just give over control of their lives to God, but I cannot. I don't think that the reason for anger is our sins, as the previous reviewer has written, but I do think this book is deceptive. Nowhere on the cover does it mention that this book will try to get you to give your anger over to God and let him take care of you, but that is exactly what this book tells you. It is a total waste of money."
22917,-1,Very Christian!,"I wish had thought to check out the reviews on a site such as this BEFORE I bought the book. Considering this is a work which is supposedly meant to help people overcome toxic anger, I imagine many people feel even more angry upon discovering the very heavy Christian slant of the book."
22919,-1,STILL DON'T HAVE,"I never recd my merchandise , true enough no fault of this seller, it was my post office, but I nevertheless I don't have it!!I still like this seller and might purchase from them again in the future!"
22922,-1,not satisfied,Packaged poorly......two bottles of the cleaning supplies were busted open.I had to throw away the entire order due to the other contents being drenchedwith the other chemicals. Very dissatisfied!!
22923,-1,disappointed,"This product was purchased as a gift, it was delivered in a plain cardboard box and the cleaning supplies was stuffed in the box with the sponge and cloths stuffed in between the bottles w/no information explaining the contents or use of the items,(If items were missing I do not know) and one of the bottles leaked inside the box. There was not enough time to return and get a replacement. I have purchased this product before and the product is not the problem, it is the way it was handled that made it an unpleasant experience."
22930,-1,I was expecting different,The music is too loud for me but I will send to to friend like that type of stuff
22933,-1,It's heat plate grows rusty within few month.,"Two years ago, I brought it and like it. I drink coffee in the morning, so only used it only once a day. Few month after I brought it, its heat plate started growing rusty. I continuely used it for additional six month when the 50% heat plate was rusted. I thought it was an incidence, so I threw it away and brought the same model again. Nine month late, 20% heat plate is rusted.... This time I don't think it is a incidence again."
22940,-1,Focuses on the negative,"Having just been told I was expecting twins, I was keen to find a book that could give me the information and reassurance that standard, ""singleton"" pregnancy books could not. But instead of finding useful information and reassurance, I finished this book feeling anxious and alarmed. It focuses far too much on the negative aspects of having twins - loss of one twin, preterm labor, birth complications, vanishing twin syndrome, etc. It is daunting enough being pregnant with twins without reading a book that reminds me of all the things that can go wrong. In addition, the author offers impractical advice on nutrition and exercise, which in many cases is contrary to advice from the medical profession. Not everyone has the money or the desire to eat seaweed and other ""macrobiotic"" health store food. All in all, I would not recommend this book to any woman expecting twins. It is alarmist and out-of-touch with real pregnant women."
22942,-1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"There isn't very much steam, very little pressure, and it isn't very hot. The steam doesn't even come out in a single stream: it kind of ""chugs"" its way out. I've used a steamer before - a little handheld one - and the steam was much hotter under much higher pressure, and much more plentiful. The salesman assured me that this would work just like the other steamer I'd used, but with the addition of a vacuum. This was completely untrue. The unit also feels clumsy to use. I find it heavy and the water tank is far too small."
22943,-1,Do not waste your money!!!,"I bought this product thinking that for the price it would work wonders - boy was I wrong!!!! Sharper image claims that the steam option alone on the machine takes stains out of your carpet - you don't have to resort to carpet shampoos - what a joke!!! I have tried to get out an assortment of stains from my carpet, from dirt to wine, and I am disapointed every time! I have had cheaper steamers that did a better job then this product. The only thing that does work on this item is it's vacuum power."
22944,-1,How can I rate something...........,"How can I rate something that I did not receive. Yes, I did order Michael Omartian, but received Randy Waldman....and to my surprise, I do enjoy it.....soothing, mesmerising....totally enjoyable. In other words it has become an enjoyable mistake. I hate it and have given it one star, because it is not what I wanted."
22947,-1,Check the rating,Review says the 303 is rated to 300 pounds. Not true - it's only rated to 250 pounds.
22951,-1,Should have never been made,"Just stick to rock. No experimentation please. That's not what Queen's music is about. Queen, Zeppelin, The Doors, Jethrotull...the ROCK man. Party on bud, but no funk."
22952,-1,An embarrassment,"I am a big Queen fan, and this cd is their worst ever. Why they put it out instead of taking a sabbatical is beyond me...The only decent songs are Under Presuure - even if the live versions tend to put the studio one to shame, and Put Out The Fire. Maybe Life Is Real could be saved from the bonfire as well. The partially Spanish-sung Las Palabras de Amor is pretty silly. I am Spanish but have always found appalling the knack of foreign artists to try and record in my language because the lyrics lose a lot and sound silly.All in all, do not buy this if you consider yourself a Queen fan, unless you're the blind-faith kind, which is notrecommendable. You'll find yourself cringing more often than not if you listen to it..."
22953,-1,"WHAT IS ""UNDER PRESSURE"" DOING HERE??!!!","QUEEN could have got away with this piece of junk had UNDER PRESSURE not been in this disc. Why? Because when you listen to that song you realize, by simple comparison, how bad all the other tunes are!!!!!! Even the ballads!!! Not to mention the dreadful opening track, STAYING POWER. THis album was an unsincere attempt by QUEEN to go disc and make some more money. Of course fans will say they ""tried a new approach"", ""experimented some new ground""... (...) THis is just a bad CD by a great band. There are hundreds of cases like that !!"
22954,-1,Keep walking,"Every good artist has an album that should have been taken out and shot.With Queen, it's this one.Olly Buxton"
22955,-1,Pretty bad choice of direction for Queen,"What happened in 1980 that made a lot of good bands turn sour? Disco! Queen was a victim of the times and perhaps a horrible identity crisis. While Body Language still pops up on greatest hits packages, that track is not enough to warrant buying this album. Stick with Queen's 70's releases."
22958,-1,Ty Beanie Babies Dog,"Don't waste your money on this one. It does not look like the photo. The product is uglier and thinner, and forget trying to comb or fluff the fur. It won't happen."
22972,-1,at least they came somewhat white,I've never wrote a review about any product. I'm usually satisfied. This however kind of ticked me off. The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them. they were also not the right size. I ended up giving them away.
22973,-1,Very Disappointed,I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker. The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $25 in shipping costs.
22984,-1,Not what the title says,"I was looking for a source that would contain actual factual information on chemistry. This book is nothing but a long, absurd joke."
22986,-1,Don't buy it!,"Zero. That's how many stars this gets. Why? There is a ream of evidence suggesting that this entire EP was taken from draft to final cut in one ... afternoon.... I previewed ""Baby's Got a Temper"" ... The wonderfully creative lyrics play out again and again: ""We love rohypnol. She's got rohypnol. We take rohypnol. She's got rohypnol. This baby's got a temper. You'll never get her.""Prodigy has produced quite a bit of good material, most of which has little or no actual message. ..."
22987,-1,Worse than I thought it could ever get,One of the worst collection of sounds ever slopped onto a disc. Utterly terrible.
22999,-1,this album has one use and one use only,"and when i say this i dont mean it to be used as entertainment or for enjoyment. when i first heard chop suey i thought the band would be worth a shot. when i popped in the cd i thought my dad was yelling at me, but it was only the music. the album is nothing like chop suey, only one other song is remotely good #8 i think. i like bands like offspring greenday ect., even rob zombie & limp bizkit. so if u like that kind of music then dont waste your money on this recording of rythmless shouting. and when i say the album has one use, it makes a nice frisbee"
23009,-1,Didn't Live Up to Expectations,I should have recognized that given the age of this film that the DVD print would be of such low quality
23011,-1,"Buy it for ""Ice Machine""","The only good thing about Speak & Spell is the fact that ""Ice Machine"" (best DM song ever, in my eyes) is on it... that is, if you have the version with the B-sides on it. The rest, while catchy, are downright wussy (especially this version of Photographic; go find the Some Bizarre version or a live version). The only other remotely listenable song on here is Tora Tora Tora! (though I wouldn't buy the standard album without the extra tracks just for Tora!)."
23015,-1,Another ten bucks I'll never see again,"Can Keanu spell ""typecast""? After those lousy Matrix sequels couldn't he have smelt the sulphur a mile away and dodged this sad excuse for a film?It's a tired formula - angels and demons are completely monstrous and amoral whereas us poor humans, the only creatures with any capacity for virtue, are stuck in the middle as their pawns. Not very original, not to mention cliche-ridden. Of course his friend (who is stereotypically geeky and likes to study arcane literature) had to die, just as he was trying to give Keanu some vital information! Of course there has to be a slow-motion scene where Keanu kills demon hybrids, a scene stolen straight from Blade. Of course he has to wear a long black coat.And suicides automatically go to hell?! Oh please. Time for filmmakers to stop adopting the dogma of a particular chuch and be more original. And what's with that horrendous depiction of the Angel Gabriel, androgynous, snooty and all but screaming fashion victim!"
23019,-1,Dumb adaptation that does not try to be even remotely good,"Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare come out of this cinematic debacle with their heads high because they do more than the script does in this film. They give more to their respective characters than they should have and make the film a little better than it really is and that's no small feat considering the fact that Keanu and the rest of the cast do look like fools thou out the entire film thanks to the badly written script and lackluster special effects.For Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, the film gets a four rating. The rest of the film does not even merit one."
23026,-1,Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans would love this movie.,"Super stupid Keanu Reeves monster movie that is so bad, I'm waiting for it to come on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Keanu is at his worse with this film and it shows on his face that even he thinks the movie is bad. Out of the entire cast, Only Rachel Weisz(Runaway Jury) and Peter Stourmar(Bad Boys 2) give credible performances that are way better than the movie itself. Rachel Weisz does more with her part than the screenwriters and the director did with making the movie and gives the film an unnecessary great performance that a way better movie could have used instead and Peter Stourmar gives class and dignity to an underwritten role that is only in the movie for about five minutes.See it for Rachel Weisz and Peter Stourmar ONLY, because the rest of the film is really bad."
23027,-1,It's the Matrix all over again.,"Rip roaring rip off of the Matrix movies that has Keanu Reeves redoing his Neo character for a supernatural tale that does not have a lot of common sense. Keanu is pretty bad in this film and it's apparent that this was an attempt to cash in on his Matrix success and some of the things that happens in the film including the over blown ending are scenes taken directly from the Matrix films. It seems to me that they were trying to establish another franchise with Keanu but this film really does not deserve a follow up. There are some good thing to say about it like the performances of Rachel Weisz, who does do far more for this film with her great and powerful performance than it does for her and Peter Stormare, whose tem minute cameo has more meat and soul than most of the performances of the film (with the excerption of Rachel Weisz of course) . Other than them, the movie is really a vanity project for those who are looking to cash in on the Matrix movies."
23029,-1,Forgettable horror movie that is almost redeemed by Rachel Weisz's stellar performance,"Forgettable horror thriller that has Keanu Reeves remaking his matrix role for an even less talented director and an even worse screenplay. Keanu's performance is a worthy effort but is not very good and he's more distracting than compelling in his role. His costar Rachel Weisz does much, much more than he does in the acting department and almost redeems the entire movie with her stellar performance but she's literally the only actor who tries to be better than the horrible script that they had to work with. A script that lacks not only common sense but a sense of purpose as well. The direction is shoddy with really bad camera work in all directions and the special effects don't hold much significance.Other than a worthy and game effort on Rachel Weisz's part. The movie is not worthy of her talent or your time."
23035,-1,"NO Plot, ALL Special EFFectS, Bad Scripting !","Somethings Just aren't Worth reviewing ...This is one of Them !Run from this feature ! I couldn't even finish watching it and I love Demon movies ! If U thought ""Lost Souls"" was bad it is a revalation compared to this !"
23038,-1,The worse.,"Dull, loud and boring adaptation of the classic horror comic book lacks a real leading man for the movie to fly with its bad script and almost as bad special effects. While Keanu fails miserably in his role, his co-star Rachel Weisz does more for this movie than the movie does for her, giving her character a real sense of grace and strong will despite the lousy dialog, badly written characters and insane plot clichés that is surrounding her during the course of the movie. Weisz's performance alone is worth the price of the movie ticket but other than her, there is really no reason rush to see the bad film.My Suggestion? Wait for DVD."
23041,-1,Please...,Terrible Keanu Reeves supernatural epic that even makes the last two matrix films look like masterpieces compared to it. Keanu does give the worse performance of his career with this turkey and the film itself is almost as bad as his performance with sloppy dialog and lackluster special effects. Rachel Weisz literally gives the only good performance in the entire movie and that's really because she is the only professional actor in it. The rest of the cast is made up of no name actors who make Keanu look like a genius in the acting profession.See it if you are desperate for entertainment or can't get a date.
23042,-1,Rather be in hell than to sit though this again.,"Super dumb Keanu Reeves horror film lacks the mind bending fun of the matrix movies and has instead a lackluster core that makes this film as hollow as a helium balloon. Keanu gives a very tired and unsparing performance that does drag the movie down most of the time and the script lacks a voice. The second half of the film manages to go against what the first half establishes and the last thirty minutes absolutely makes no sense what so ever because it has a certain revelation that makes no sense what so ever and leave you wondering on what the hell just happen. The rest of the cast is solid with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare which the film does not expand on and the script does not give more time to because it only wants to focus its energies on Keanu's bad attitude than the real actors that are in the film.What a shame."

You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie."
23048,-1,Pure stupidly,"Horrible and down right stupid Keanu Reeves action/horror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but it solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that makes everything about this film into a joke. I feel sorry for his fellow actors which Includes Rachel Weisz, (who give the movie's only real performance) for even being on the same screen with him because despite their good work and effort, he manages to make the movie into a real choir to watch.The word of mouth is justified for this piece of garbage."
23051,-1,absolutely awful,"This is easily one of the worst movies I have seen in years. A barely comprehensible mess, with no redeeming qualities."
23055,-1,Much worse than I expected.,Mind bending stupid horror film that lacks any form of common sense what so ever with a script that was looked like it was written by a ten year old with dialog only a child could understand and a leading man who is as bad an actor as they come. [...] The special effects are not really good and the direction seems forced in some places. The only performance of merit that this film has is from Rachel Weisz who does much more with her character than she needed to and she does lift this film pass much of it's problems but a good actor can do only do so much with out the help of the director or the rest of the cast and she's basically by herself in this film in terms of good acting.Avoid.
23060,-1,Horrible,I'm a fan of Rachel Weisz but not even her effort could have saved this extreamly bad film. Keanu Reeves should be put in jail for his horrible performance and the director should never direct again for his lack of directional skills.Avoiud like the pluge.

23074,-1,I read this book for college,If you like auto-biographies of egomaniacs that have lived a lewd and lacivious life. Go ahead and read it. I didn't like it. I could put zero stars but amazon wouldn't let me.
23087,-1,Didn't work,This didn't work for me. But then neither did freezing or medicated tape. So it may or may not work for you.Other than that the biggest negative is that this looks too much like chapstick. It should have been designed to look different so that children don't apply it accidentally.
23089,-1,Don't waste your money!,"I wish I could give this product no stars.I bought this stuff from a local health store and used it as directed. The product boasts a higher content of salicylic acid than other products. When I applied the product I was expecting it to burn. However, I never felt a thing. It's doesn't go on very smooth either (it's not like lip balm) and seems to cake up. I used it for 2 months and the wart actually got a little bigger. I saw no noticeable change other than that. It was a waste of money for me. When I went back to the health store to tell the guy about the product, they had already stopped selling it because of complaints of it not working. Oh well."
23099,-1,Too good to be true,"At first this item seemed like a bargain, but after following the directions of drying out after the first use, it never worked again. This product literally worked great for about 15 minutes. After that, I found out it was a little water logged so I sat it down to dry. It has not worked since. If you are thinking about buying this product because it is a good price then forget about it. It is a waste of time and money."
23101,-1,Cute but not functional,"This bed is very cute! But the sides do not come up high enough, to at act as side rails. But high enough to cause injury when rolling around in the bed, as my toddlers do. But, your toddler will love it...and you'll need to buy a new bed soon."
23102,-1,Dangerous wouldn't advise buying,I bought these beds for my twin 2 year olds. They look great and yes they are durable but they are dangerous. The wood frame is not rounded off and if they fall on to them they will hurt themselves. My kids like most roll around all the time as well and I constantly hear their heads and body banging into the wood. I don't understand why someone would make a product geared towards little children but not make them safe. The frame absolutely should be rounded off not sharp as it is. I am moving on and buying plastic car beds for them so that way they do fall or hit themeselves on it the outcome won't be so severe. I wish I would have known this when I purchased them. I thought you should know before buying.
23108,-1,This is a WineGard SS-3000 Antenna,"The antenna pictured is made by Winegard (model number SS-3000) that is normally sold everywhere on the internet for substantially less. So you are paying a lot more for the same antenna with a TERK name on it, it appears."
23117,-1,Don't read this book!,"This is the kind of book that has poor grammer, misspelled words, and is too long. Often times authors make their books drag on and on and on. I feel that is what the author of this book did. I would suggest that you find another book to read and not waist your time."
23120,-1,Boring,This book was totally boring. Even though it was 1 of the greatest books I've read.HAhahahaha
23123,-1,Credit Cards Will Not Fit,All the credit card slots are to small for credit cards. I had to cut each side of the slots to get the cards to fit.
23146,-1,Inedible. Really wanted to like it.,"I would rather eat sticks or leaves from my yard. The noodles are awful, the broth is typical ramen broth. I bought a three cases of these because Nissin Choice ramen was discontinued at the supermarket and I wanted something a little more healthy because I eat ramen for breakfast often.I told my four coworkers I was going to throw out all the ramen and they all tried a packet. They all agreed it was the worst ramen they had ever tasted by far and wouldn't take it for free. I think I am going to donate it to the food bank, pity the homeless."
23152,-1,Did Not Work,This item is really beautiful. When I recieved it I immediately plugged it in to try it out and it worked great. So I unplugged it and put it back into the box. The day I planned on using it to keep already cooked hot dogs warm and on display for customers at a charity event. Well it never heated up when I took it out of the box the second time. Too late to send it back so oh well I am stuck with it. It is really pretty but that is the extent of the functionality I have found for this product.
23157,-1,Horrible customer service!!! Magazine has not arrived after 5 months!!!,"I bought the magazine subscription a WHILE back and has yet to receive an issue. It is very pricey and I thought it would be worth the price, if only I were able to have it! I contacted Amazon which then contacted them and have been told that sometime in late April the first issue of the magazine will arrive...I looked at many posts (sadly afterward) at cake central which had similar complaints. Save your money."
23158,-1,Don't Waste Your Money,"My sister has this single, and she spends all of her time whining about how she wishes she hadn't bought it. I agree completely. Kelly Osbourne is one of the biggest poseurs I've ever seen in my life. She has an awful voice, and the only reason she got into music is because someone - as a joke, probably - told her that she could make it. I did end up listening to the songs, and I nearly killed myself. ""Changes"", which was her only hit, was HORRIBLE. If you want to hear the REAL ""Changes"", buy Black Sabbath's ""Vol. 4"". This was a sad case of a classic destroyed by a new wannabe artist. I can't believe that Ozzy agreed to do a duet with her. Ozzy, how could you? I cringe just thinking about it. If you want real music, buy anything from Black Sabbath, which is the greatest heavy metal band EVER (only the Ozzy years, though), or anything from Ozzy's first two solo albums.Peace everybody, and keep rocking (to good music, though)."
23161,-1,Too much sex!,"Have read all the books published to date. Loved the plots and story lines. Finally through them all out (Yep, tossed one paperback and two hardcopy) as I realized as I was re-reading them, that the somewhat graphic sex (Dominance and Submission, and Harem Girls, etc) didn't really add to the story but sure promoted things I just don't like. The March Upcountry series with David Weber had boys and girls, and talked about sex, but was what I consider more normal for SciFi, and was not graphic, did not promote ""alternative"" sex. So while I enjoy the James Bond nature of the novels, I really can't recommend them to any of my friends, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone younger."
23164,-1,"a total rip if you own ""Music has the right to children""","If you already own ""Music has the right to children"" and you are itching for more BoC like I was then just take a deep breath and be content with ""Music.."" becasue this cd is a money making scheme just about. All the songs on it are the same ones, there is no re-mixing at all. But, there is one exception at the end they play a 2 minute bit that gets you excited but then ends. This is hardly worth 12.99 so looks like you and me are gonna have to wait until BoC makes a new album. Awwwwwwwww hurry up guys!"
23166,-1,Not impressed!,"The author never addressed what went on (if anything) between Ryan and the sister. I have mixed feelings about Ryan and would have appreciated some clarification.Tempe.....she thinks she omnipotent; she barges in to situations with no regard for her safety or the other people she drags in with her.There is too much unwanted detail(clothes, food, geography etc.)and detracted from the story. I found the ending very boring.I do like Kathy Reichs. I've read a good number of the books in this series and really like some and others (like this one) not at all??"
23171,-1,This batteries are completely worthless!!!,"Purchased two of this batteries in September of 2007. They worked fine for a while. Stored them fully charged for about 3 months. When i tried to use them again both batteries had fully discharged, after charging them they each ran for about one minute each and died. Tried to recharge them but they wouldn't hold a charge no matter how many times or how long i put them on the charger. By comparison the original battery from canon only lost about one quarter of its charge in three months and is working the same as new. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT, they are unreliable. You wouldn't want to miss videotaping an important event due to battery failure."
23173,-1,Had to stop reading,I couldn't get through this. It was so dull. main character was really uninteresting. seemed to be creepily interested in high school girls. couldn't figure out the purpose of the unspecified Hotline... I've put down probably 5 books in my life - I read everything. but this - just couldn't hold me.
23175,-1,Cheap crystal set.,"As a previous reviewer stated, the creamer and sugar dish are of a ridiculously small size and are not the same as shown in the picture. One of the salt and pepper shakers was lopsided. The set is made in China and is worth $20 at best. I would be embarrassed to give this as a gift."
23178,-1,don't buy this book......,"....unless you have nothing else to spend your money on. I am a great fan of the other books, especially 1633, but this one is a poorly, maybe even unethically, conceived project. Many of the ""stories"" contained in the book were written by non-professional writers, and it really shows. Apparently many of them are available on the web, which makes the decision to publish them in book form, without warning the purchaser, rather iffy, in my opinion. The theme that is supposed to hold everything together, ""Brillo"" and his use as a symbol for a new form of government, is just, well, lame. The songs are unbelievably tedious, and the idea is not ever presented coherently.Pass on this one, save your money for 1634: The Baltic War."
23186,-1,disappointed!,I wore it once and a stone has already fallen out. Spent way too much money for that to be acceptable.
23191,-1,America is Going Deaf,"I find it very hard to understand how anyone could listen to this music, as a vivd music listener and an open minded one at that, this music was the most horrid bit of sound I have ever heard. People need to stop and remember what real talent is, not this uncoordinated, bad singing group. Their music is as is they are making up the guitar riffs as they go, and I don't find it difficult to scream. So Glassjaw if your ever in need of a new screamer, I'm your man."
23194,-1,Chandipath,The quality of CD is hopeless. Thre are too many glitches. I could not listen all the contents. CD jumps from one song to third song. I will not recommand to buy this CD. The problem is processing of CD. All the songs are excellent and music is very good. The printed label on CD came off.
23196,-1,Moll Flanders,This book has the honor of being one of only two books that I have ever read that I TRULY regret having wasted my time on. I really and truly did not think that I would be able to finish this one BUT I ALWAYS finish a book once I start it. In my opinion this is one of those cases when a very controversial novel gets confused with a great novel. I am however VERY grateful that I picked it up at a library sale for only 50 cents.; 0 ) Sorry Moll Flanders fans.
23198,-1,Didn't grab me,"I usually like books about weird science, but I have to say that this one didn't grab me-- maybe because I got to it right after reading Kip Thorne's book on Black Holes and Time Warps. It's ok, but didn't seem special."
23200,-1,Avoid if possible,"This book is riddled with mistakes from incorrect derivations to incorrect tables in the appendix. Our class has our own lengthy errata webpage. As for the meat of the book, the derivations are not really fleshed out, and there are very few examples to go by. Except for one chapter devoted to applied problems, I lack to see how this book is called ""very applied""."
23202,-1,Very Dissappointed,"This camera comes with no instructions or warranty information. The zoom feature doesn't exist as indicated in the technical data and editorial reviews. It doesn't even seem to be the camera advertised, but then who knows for sure when no written information is included."
23203,-1,Them folks done messed it up,"I was so excited to find out that this record was finally remastered until I found out that they completely changed the order of the songs how they originally appeared. To listen to an older recording is to listen to how other folks listened to it at the time. It's rather wrong to mess up the original sequence of things. It's fine to add extra tracks at the end of the album, but for crying out loud, don't mess with the song order. Marty would be rolling in his grave I'm sure."
23204,-1,VERY disappointed!!!,"I thought I would like this book as the subject manner and descriptions sounded interesting. But the author would start a train of thought and then abort the idea and move on to another - I seemed like I was listening to an crudely abridged version! I will NOT read another of hers if this is the way she writes. I was very disappointed...this book could have been great!!!! The characters I felt were shallow and so much more could have been done to deepen their personalities, thoughts and feelings."
23209,-1,Does not work with nfl2k and nba2k!,This nyko jump pack sucks it will not work with nfl2k or nba2k. It works great in sonic. Just pick up the madcatz froce pack it much much better.
23216,-1,Doesn't work,The connection between the hose and the sprayer seems to be missing a part or something. There's no washer and there is an obvious path for water to escape. It leaks like crazy. Only recommended if it is hot outside and you want to get sprayed while fertilizing your plants.
23218,-1,The old one worked well.,"The miracle gro product is great, especially in an arid area with little rain to activate a granule product, but the new feeder design is pathetic. When I FINALLY got it working properly, it dribbled constantly during and in between use. I checked all washers and retightened everything to no avail. The trigger has to be contantly depressed during use, and you have to squeeze AS HARD AS YOU CAN, regardless of the water pressure. It was exhausting. Do they bother to beta test these things? The old one dribbled a little if it tipped over, but otherwise was fine. It also had one switch and stayed on without having to constantly apply pressure. I'd still be using it if the container hadn't blown away in a wind storm."
23219,-1,Very poor idea,I have used the old Model #100409 garden feeder and was pleased. I used the old feeder with it's hose to hose connection. This way I could water my lawn when it was hot and dry. I cannot stand for two hours watering my large back yard with an end hose feeder.
23221,-1,Junk,I just got done using this thing and it didn't even work as expected. It takes FOREVER for it to fill with water. Then it seemed to never spray out the lawn fertilizer. I had to basically tilt the ting upside down and on its side for the water to even turn blue. NEVER AGAIN. Scotts - Please revamp this for next season. This thing is JUNK!
23229,-1,Racism in reverse?,"Sad,sad book. Although raised in NYC,I lived in both North and South Carolina during the 1960's and agree there was racism....but this pushes the limits of reality. White people in power (in the clan of course) are all mean and stupid and kill little black children. Shame on the author."
23239,-1,SHAMELESS: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON,i'm STILL waiting to receive it since Xmas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I can't seem to track it and don't know who to send an email to????????????can you help track this down????????????
23247,-1,THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!,"This movie is bad! There is so much to say about why it is bad, I do not even know where to start. First, There is really no plot! NONE! The acting In this film is also awful! The script, Awful! Everything, awful!. I am so glad I rented this, and did not buy it without seeing it! I gave this movie 1 star, but it really doesn't even deserve that! This film only has one good thing going for it, an Early appearance by JENNIFER GARNER. I have been a fan of hers since the 1999 TV series TIME OF YOUR LIFE. This movie should have been a short film, a very short film, then maybe it would have been entertaining. It is not short, it seems to never end. This is by far THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! Don't even waste your time watching this..."
23253,-1,"""Dude, Where's My Brain?""","I despise this movie. I really do believe my dog's life is more interesting than this. ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" makes you wish you hadn't paid a whopping two dollars to rent it and it also makes you wonder if anyone actually likes this. Dude, a tsunami crashing down on my head would've have been more fulfilling than sitting through this movie. It really needs to go away forever and never come back."
23254,-1,No,"The writer of this film should be killed, and every copy of it should be burned. This is by far the worst film I have ever forced myself to sit through, aside from The Blair Witch Project 2. It's horrible."
23255,-1,Worst comedy of the year,"This has got to be the worst comedy I have seen all year. I don't recall through the whole movie laughing more than once. The plot was totally idiotic. I really don't understand why these actors do these movies, I mean don't they read the scripts? This movie is so bad that I wouldn't even recommend renting it. The only reason I watched it all was because I payed PPV for it and didn't want to waste my money. Through the entire movie you just keep waiting for it to get funny but it just never does."
23259,-1,Dude wheres my money back?,This movie was terrible....even stiffler loses cool points for doing such a horrid movie....anyone who gave this 5-stars deserves to be dragged out of their house and blugeoned with a lead pipe.
23270,-1,The most boring recording EVER!,"This is, in my opinion, techno at it's best. However, because it is techno, it's AWFUL. Every track here is about twice as long as it should be, and each gets boring after the first minute. I despise techno because it's always the same thing over, and over, and over. And over. And over. The sampling just rips off other artists, and what little new musical ingenuity exists is buried so deeply in the mix that all you hear is the damn drums and the same samples replayed indefinitely. A little bit of lyrical change would be nice too, instead of ""Rock y'all, gonna stock y'all, to the beat y'all, the bodyrock y'all"" twenty seven times over. And over. And over. And over. And over."
23280,-1,Electronicrap,"lets put it this way: if you want to buy the juggling alchemists under the black light, or IFO by etnica/pleiadians, you can expect to pay hundreds of dallars. probably more if you want it on vinyl, or care about condition. i just saw a mint condition IFO on vinyl up for sale for a fitting $604.00. (goa). it's not a limited edition vinyl, it's not signed, it doesn't have extra tracks, most if not all of their fans have a downloaded version of it on their harddrives, and it's not pressed from solid gold. it's just a regular old IFO album. and people will buy it for that price. they will buy it because the pleiadians/etnica are genius. no one's spending $604.00 on a moby album. at this point you may be thinking that no album is worth hundreds of dallars. if so, that's because you listen to moby, and think play is a good album."
23290,-1,"burned skin, radiation?","I have had this lamp for about 9 months now and I was happy with it until recently. I spend my time studying 4 to 5 hours at a time on week days. Lately I've noticed that my skin specially around my hands start burning when I'm doing work under the lamp. I tried placing it further away but the burn slowly built up as long as the lamp was turned on near by. Once I made this connection I immediately unplugged it and started using my old regular lamp and what do ya know, no more burning skin. It's a shame because I really liked the quality of the light, kind of like sun light. Unfortunately it seems to carry similar radiation properties because the skin burn from the lamp feels just like a skin burn from the sun. I make all of my amazon purchases based on reviews so I felt like I had an obligation to let others know. I hope this helps someone."
23295,-1,Ghastly,"If you have any interest in and concern for the written word in extended texts then this book is not for you: 95% of these designers seem to actively loathe it. It already looks out of date; grossly impoverished intellectually, this arty rubbish is of a piece with the poverty of contemporary trade book production."
23300,-1,"poor sound, quality","Bought this phone several years ago; should have returned it at once. Sound quality is poor and by about a year later, the LCD display began flaking out. The display and the selector wheel are now both useless. Battery has already been replaced twice and is dead again."
23307,-1,By far one of the worst movies I've ever seen... EVER!,"If you value your time and money, don't waste 10 more seconds thinking about buying this horribly bad movie. You will want to write to the producers and ask them to give you an hour and a half of your life back. This movie is a tribute to the eternal question of, ""Why do people keep giving Jennifer Aniston movies?"" I'm not saying that this movie is the worst one ever made, but without a doubt it comes in a very close second."
23311,-1,hate it,this would have been a good movie but the language ruined it all. will never watch again in fact will probably destroy it. language like that does not make a movie!
23312,-1,"Poor, lackluster",I bought this video after reading so many great reviews of it. Even coming from an office environment I found almost no really funny parts -- for me the movie just dragged on and on - I kept watching waiting for it to pick up - up to the end...
23315,-1,Very disappointing & dumb,Hi! I collect cookbooks and never give bad reviews but this book was awful! There wasn't one cute food idea that I would make for my child. I was hoping for cute snacks I could make for pre-school & this book was a waste of money. I got better ideas just off of the internet.
23317,-1,broken,"Got this toy a few months early as a christmas present, but by the time the present was given and taken out of the package, found out it didnt actually work, and by then it was too late to return it. Would have been cute if it had actually worked."
23321,-1,What started out to be a beautiful movie....thrown in the trash!,"This was recommended to be a wonderful movie, not to be missed, in our local small town paper.Indeed it started out to be just that, even with viewing it in-between the English subtitles (German made, German language) Magnificent scenes of Africa, and beautiful people all through out. Then, right in the middle, and totally unnecessary by all standards, very graphic sex scenes between 2 of the characters. I could not believe it! It ruined what could have been a totally beautiful movie in scenery and story. I was so angry I immediately threw it in the biggest trash can I could find. I was so angry I didn't want to talk about it, let alone give time to write a review, until now. Enough said, don't waste time or money on this movie. I still have yet to speak to the man who wrote the recommendation but will the next time I see him. (I live out in the wilds of our Island, not in the town)"
23326,-1,Disappointed,"Yet another mediocre addition to an already saturated market of casino based games. This game brings nothing new to the table. The graphics are very redundant and do very little if nothing to take advantage of the 2D/3D hardware which is present in the majority of gamer's machines at present. Bottom line, too little too late."
23335,-1,A very difficult text book to learn anything from,"I get the impression that the reader from NH is the only reviewer to have tried to solve some of the problems in this book. There is no possible way to solve these problems. They are on subjects and situations not covered in the book, and even if they were, good luck in understanding Bejan's writing. He skips massive steps, giving only solutions and equations without explanations. Not everyone like reviewer Jeff Booth was born understanding convective heat transfer, so some of us must learn from books. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one. I only hope that Dr. Bejan reads these reviews and that they discourage him from making another failed attempt at text book writing."
23336,-1,Waste of money,"Too bad ! I really thought this would help. Very cheaply made IMO. You're better off building one with a frame and some Rockwool. It'll get the job done. I didn't feel a huge difference, and actually didn't like the boxiness of the sound that I was getting. Using an old U87 + UA pre and Comp. Just not worth that kind of money, when you can DIY for less than 50 bucks. It looks cool, but I only care about sound."
23341,-1,Not Reader Friendly,"This book is hard on the eyes.I read part of it and gave up. All the graphs are printed in blue and uses different types of shading to show different regions. The font size is about 8 or 10. The size of the book is ackward more like what is suited towards an advertising pamphlet. Quite clearly, Penguin is being super cheap about printing this book. It was published in the last few years so I'm totally confused what's the issue here. I mean come on. I can print full color pages on my laser printer for about 3 cents a page. Why can't a big fancy publisher like Penguin do a decent job printing a book?Buy a different book, your eyes will thank you!"
23344,-1,Boooo Harper Collins!,"For some reason Harper Collins specifically arranges for Canadians who buy ebooks via the Amazon.com website to get higher pricing and exclude them from sale pricing. I can't imagine why, it takes no more to deliver to us wirelessly and I'd have to assume our converted US funds are just as good."
23350,-1,Merely the same things rehashed,"I recieved this book as a gift from someone I thought to be an open-minded, good person. This book has nothing new in it. It is worthless. It is just another example of a poor deluded SOB trying to convince himself that he really likes the cage he was tricked into entering.This book is prosylazation. Prosylatizers, I have found, try to convert people because they are insecure about their faith, and think that by converting the world they will be secure in their faith. The truly faithful person does not prosylatize, for if one is secure in one's faith, why preach? If I could give this book a NEGATIVE FIVE, I would."
23364,-1,A disappointing book.,"The heroine is a bloody racist (which is taken for wit, I guess). What a turn-off."
23365,-1,Protofeminist Psychobabble--Not Worth Your Time,"I tried giving it a shot but the book is (1) not sexy, as it is marketed, (2) about a lurid main character/narrator whom I can't follow, (3) filled with 1970s-style Freudian psycho-bull that attempts, amateurishly, to explain gender roles and relations, and (4) very solipsistic. It doesn't seem at all like fiction but the bickerings of a sexually frustrated woman who thinks too much about herself and who doesn't seem to be all that bright but manages to parade under some kind of feministic pseudo-intellectual banner. I just found the narrator despicable and didn't finish the book. I can't believe it has such a high review on Amazon, which means, I guess, that the majority of people reading it in 2011 are people who are already sympathetic to the book or author.Don't bother. If you want sex pick up Anais Nin or Zane or Philip Roth--anything else that has a story or good prose style, just not this."
23370,-1,Burt most have needed the $$.,"Great actor, absolutely terrible movie. So bad that it is almost funny."
23375,-1,double dipping,"American gets dodgeball-grab life by the ball--UK is getting dodgeball uncut-grab life by the balls--more scenes from rip torn and cheerleading backflashes has apparently been taken out from the American release. Don't buy, just wait until they release it uncut. From what I have read online, uncut has some quite hilarious scenes"
23381,-1,Weakest Link is the Star,"I saw this movie on an airplane, flying New York to Sao Paulo. A long flight, so I was ready for something lame to pass the time.I got it: something lame.Ben Stiller is the stupidest part of this movie: He doesn't deliver much comedy. He's a Johnny One-Note who made me tired after his first 30 seconds.The rest of the movie was passable. I would have given it 3 stars for being a pleasant way to survive a 10-hour, cramped and crowded flight.But Stiller was so boring, so pointless, so NON-funny, that I knocked the movie down to 1 star.I sense all his movies are like that: overblown, stupid, not funny.Which is too bad, because the supporting cast did OK."
23392,-1,Do NOT buy this edition of Democracy and Education,"This edition of the book is absolutely awful. The type is small and printed in a grayish fuzzy font that is hard to read. The margins are almost nonexistent. There is no space to write notes, not even at the bottom of the page. You will notice that this book is only 194 pages, whereas I recently found a very good used copy that is 378 pages. Both are unabridged, but in this edition the text is crammed onto the pages. Also, just scanning through the book today I quickly found two typos. Avoid this cheaply constructed edition. I sincerely hope Amazon stops selling it."
23418,-1,The Studio Managed To Destroy A Classic Tale,"This dvd release is so horrible. This movie should have been restored to the level it deserved to be. They made it full screen with lousy, awful, distorted sound and I guess the bonus features are the extra grainy picture and ugly cover art. All of us fans of the movie deserve a re-release of the dvd complete with bonus features, 5.1 sound, complete digital restoration and more of a mystical,magical, beautiful cover to the dvd. They should know by now that they can sell more if they give us more.Studio people please rescue this film from complete destruction."
23419,-1,The Last Unicorn VHS,"Actually I would like the option to give this tape a 0 star rating. I bought this video for my pre-school aged nephews as a Christmas gift. I thought a Rankin Bass video would be good/safe for children. I finally watched it with them the other day. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone. The characters in the story swear. A haggish woman swears at the unicorn saying ""Damn you, damn you!"" The knight/hero character says ""Damn."" A troll type creature says something like ""What the Hell, am I supposed to look at."" and a magician takes God's name in vain after being accosted by a tree he brought to life, which is a buxom ""woman tree"" who makes a pass at the magician. Shocking. If my nephews went up to their parents and used these expressions from the movie, they would be reprimanded by their parents who do not talk like that. I now know that I need to preview every video I buy for my nephews before giving them a present. Shame on Rankin Bass"
23421,-1,CUSS Words for children!!!! Give me a break!,"If you monitor what your children watch, don't buy this as it has several incidences of foul adult language! It has the word ""damn"" in it twice and other situations that are for adults. I gave it a one star because the graphic animation is nicely done."
23460,-1,Didn't work for me,"I was hopeful that this would be the affordable answer to the bunion problem (as opposed to surgery), but this product made my foot more painful than it was already. I stopped using it after about a month and have had better success (or at least less pain) by wearing only comfy shoes (no heels) and swimming/bike riding instead of walking for exercise. I don't recommend it."
23468,-1,"You can keep my money, but can I have my 2 hours back?","If the love of your life was just kidnapped and tortured to death, your dog had just been run over and killed, and your doctor just told you that you have both AIDS and Ebola, this might be a good time to see this movie. Even with all your bad news, you could still feel good that you were not the producer or director of this movie. This movie is a triple threat: bad script, bad acting, and bad directing. Even having Tom Cruise doesn't save this flick. I wish Amazon's rating system allowed me to add negative stars rather than just give it one."
23472,-1,misrepresented usefulness,"Book was advertised to help with any type of writing. It is not. It is only useful for improving the writing of articles, ie. newspaper, mag. etc."
23481,-1,Brilliant reading ruined by bad mastering,"Douglas Adams' reading of The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is truly engaging. The problem with this audio book is two-fold:1. None of the tracks has any text-encoding. This means that devices that read this information cannot use or display the CD names or track names. So, an iTunes won't read any CD or track names. Nor will any CD player that can show track names.2. CD #6 of the set repeats the same scene over and over, without ever reaching the ending.New Millenium Audio destroyed a perfectly enjoyable performance with its poor mastering of the CD."
23483,-1,you have got to be kidding me,I am absolutely appalled and saddened to see a book with this title.I've been lost in the 'Alzheimer' labyrinth for the past decade.I have no need for a condescending book of this ilk.The title alone makes me want to vomit.Shame on the authors and anyone associated with it.Alzheimer's Disease is too complex a disease for a 'Dummies' manual.This deeply disturbs me.~m
23496,-1,"hysterical, and then, just bad, mostly","i cannot, with good conscience recommend this movie.please, look at it! it's awful!drew barrymore, in her sad ""poison ivy"" stage, is a wretched performer. there are pothole plothole's all over the place. and it's itchy to watch the scene with her real mother, jaid barrymore. were they attempting reconcilliation through a b-movie?oh! and the guy from adventures in babysitting, father of the bride & a few episodes of friends is in it, fumbling around too. where is that guy?there's a tough broad friend, a spooky house & at one point SPOILER: drew splits in half all oogy and walks around like some really skinny anatomy horror movie thingy.hey! now it sounds kind of good again."
23499,-1,Roman Catholicism,"Highly unscholarly. At least one major error on every page. Pick a page, any page. And the allegations can be easily refuted. It will never be considered a ""scholarly book"". A comic book.... perhaps. A real scholar once told me, ""All the claims can be easily refuted. It would be funny, if it wasn't for the fact that so many people take it seriously"". As for sources.... none. Oh yes, they are shown, but if you follow them it goes something like this.... A points to B, B points to C, C points to A. Basically they are pointing to each other for proof. Very poorly done. I would suggest reading ""Fathers Know Best"" by Jimmy Akin if you want to study the early Christians."
23505,-1,"If you are an anti-Catholic, this book is for you","""There will come a time when men will no longer put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own selfish desires, they will surround themselves by a great number of teachers telling them what their itching ears want to hear."" This is the what Boettner has done in this book: what many call the ""Handbook of Anti-Catholicism."" It is filled, cover to cover, with half-truths and lies regarding the Catholic faith. If you want the Catholic (truthful) response to Boettner's book, please read CATHOLICISM & FUNDAMENTALISM by Karl Keating. Keating demolishes Boettner's ROMAN CATHOLICSM verse by verse."
23510,-1,Don't waste your time,Poorly written with little scholarly merit or research value....just validates the theory that a good majority of fundamentalists are more concerned with discrediting Catholic tradition than they are about justifying their own flawed religious beliefs...
23517,-1,Unscholarly? Yes. Should you get it? Yes.,"I'm a catholic apologist and even though there are holes in this book ""big enough to drive trucks through"", the fact remains that, in my experience, many of our protestant bretheren still use the stuff in this book. I don't know why but they do. And so, you need to to know all the ""bad"" arguments that they will come up with and this book has them all. Some of it is pretty funny. Anyone who wants to defend the faith should get this book.If you need answers to this book, you can check out, ""Catholicism and Fundamentalism..."" by Karl Keating. He goes through ""Roman Catholicism"" piece by piece. I gave this book one star because of all the reasons listed in the other reviews above. He does quote pretty accurately (assuming he has a source at all), but he quotes all of it out of context. So be prepared."
23523,-1,Im sorry,I really don't like to leave bad reviews but this has got to be the worst piece of trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. If I didn't get it as a gift I would have thrown it up it in the air and blown it away with my shot gun gathered together all the pieces and shot them again. Then after I was done with that I would have to light them on fire put the ashes in a box tie it to a brick and throw it is a deep river Jumanji style.
23525,-1,POOR quality,I had a farbaerware saucepan for 41 years. It received frequent use and was a great product. I finally decided to replace it. The new saucepan is already pitted inside and the lip around the ouside edge is impossible to clean. The bottom of the pot has scratched the top of my stove. I really wish I hadn't disposed of the old one. This one belongs in the trash.
23529,-1,A complete waste of time!,"I just finished the third volume of David Moody's zombie series ""AUTUMN"". I must admit to being somewhat excited after reading the 1st book in the series, but ultimately this entire series was a complete disappoinment. Here's why: Somewhere about 3/4 of the way through the 1st book the author makes the disasterous decision to concentrate his book on character development of his ""still-living"" characters. That is fine, but unfortunately Moody totally abandons his ""bread and butter"" in the book: ZOMBIES! They are completely NON-threatening and really nothing more than topics of conversations for his characters. Can you say: BORING!!!Don't waste your time on this series of books."
23533,-1,Too weird,"I guess I expected humor. Instead, it was a downer. I made it thru about a third of the book and gave up."
23540,-1,pretentious garbage,"i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages. i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign. i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something. the impression i instantly got was ""BEEP BEEP! PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."" guess what, mr. sedaris? i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood. millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card. check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style."
23541,-1,Have to return it.,"It is poorly designed. The answer is not clear to see when the button is pushed. Even you can read the answer, it can be easily hidden by the finger. The question (A x B) are painted on top of the button, and it can be easily worn out. I can't believe a product of such a poor design can be put for sale. It is already 2011! I have to return it."
23547,-1,ENUFF,"I am not a Neil Young fan at all. I heard the song 'The Painter' on Q104.3 the other day. The DJ Maria Millito was raving about this song before she played it. I almost drove off the road. Sounded like a cat, who got his tail caught in a closing door... PLEASE Neil, put the guitar & microphone away and go a rocking on your porch...."
23548,-1,"More Hash, Less Rehash","This album is lifeless and trite and all the more so when compared to the rest of the albums in his catalog. The hype surrounding this album smacks of the same fawning attempts to honor Dylan now that he has entered his washed-up phase. Like so many other reviewers have stated, buy the old stuff instead, its grittier, more powerful and more substantial-everything that Prairie Wind is not."
23561,-1,lame as sin! did not like it!,Boring!! wasn't expecting watching same scenes over and over! Next time I will pay attention what I am buying. Comparing to any other movies I would not recommend this movie.
23564,-1,So bad it hurt.,"I rented this off iTunes, and I wish I didn't. It's your basic time-loop flick. The acting sucked, writing sucked. The best part of the film was the 30 seconds of CG weather. Don't waste your money."
23570,-1,a disappointing bore,"I was so looking forward to this novel - a somewhat trashy page-turner with an interesting historical backdrop. Well, it wasn't a page-turner, and the historical backdrop was so far from believable that I had no interest. It was trashy and truly juvenile. Frankly, I'm shocked that so many people have rated this novel highly. If you want a fun, trashy, historical page-turner, try Anne Rice's ""Cry To Heaven."" That was a guilty pleasure which I loved. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" falls miles short."
23572,-1,The worst historical fiction I've ever read,"I am astonished that this was published...it's truly awful, historically inaccurate. It reads like the author read a couple of books about the period, took notes and then forgot all the facts on record. Anne was the younger sister, for example. There is no record that she ever committed incest with her brother George. The early years at the French court are omitted, which provide an insite as to why the Boleyns began their rise to power."
23574,-1,Tawdry,"For a classier historical novel about the Boleyns, I recommend The Lady in the Tower by Jean Plaidy."
23578,-1,I Lost It!!,I lost this book after about the first 50 pages. I think that I did it on purpose. If I want to read fairy tales I will go back to the Brothers Grimm.
23579,-1,Review Based on the First Few Pages,"Maybe I know too much about Tudor England. The author's placing Anne as the eldest sibling bugged me right off the bat, as I'm almost positive most historians see her as the younger sister. Or, maybe I'm too big a fan of the fascinating Anne to buy anything from boring cow Mary's perspective, I don't know. All I know is, I've only read the first few pages and I'm bored and turned off by this book. I should want to read it. I bought it. But somehow, I just can't be bothered. I recently read a book about Frida Khalo written from her jealous sister's perspective, and it was [junk], so maybe it's bad vibes. Either way, this book isn't nearly as interseting as it's title would suggest."
23587,-1,Disappointing is an Understatement,"If you're looking for well developed characters, thoughtful dialogue, or intellectual stimulation, don't pick up this book. The Tudor period is fascinating and offers all you need for a gripping plot. The story itself is quite intriguing when written about by others. Despite hearing rave reviews, I found Philippa Gregory's prose to be poorly constructed and incredibly irritating. I wasn't bothered by the historical inaccuracies; after all, it is a ""novel"" and many of the facts are debatable.If you want a long read on par with a Harlequin Romance (actually, those are better), then this would be a perfect fit. I would have given ""0"" stars if I could have."
23589,-1,cheap romance posing as historical fiction,"Clearly, I'm in the minority here, and I did only read 112 pages, or the first two chapters.Abominable. Painful in its lack of subtlety or craft.The language of the book does nothing to evoke the 16th century. At one point, the main character practically says ""Whatever!"" (I forget her actual comment, and I'm not going to torture myself by turning on my Sony PRS to search for one line in a crummy book.)It should be a good movie. It clearly goes for the gusto with sex and intrigue, but that's all it has: enough to float a movie for 90 minutes, but I've already wasted one afternoon on the book, which is more than it deserves. I enjoy a sexy film as much as the next girl, but I'm not going to spend hours reading this vapid tale."
23591,-1,Bad Tudor Porn,"If OK magazine and Penthouse had been writing in the 1500's this is what they would have come up with.First, it is a badly written book. It is essentially bad Tudor porn. No characters are well written, and they are all insufferable. Honestly they couldn't behead Anne fast enough for me. Even Mary, who should have been the heroine/likeable one was a winy, annoying character.Second, if you're going to make it up just call it fiction and don't try to pass it off as history. Do some basic research. If I can refute the basic ""facts"" of your book in 5 minutes with Google, it's not history in any sense of the word.This book does not deserve to be a best seller, she does not deserve to be identified as an historical fiction writer. I look at author recommendations on books, and if she recommends it I put it down and move on."
23595,-1,Don't bother,"The third part of this book is devoted to establishing Catholic ""Mary"" as GOD. This is nothing but Catholic propaganda that is absolutely not true. ""Mary"" spews messages calling her followers her children. Let me clarify this absurdity: children of ""Mary"" are not children of GOD.Keep away from these shenanigans. This is a blasphemy."
23602,-1,No good for nursing,"There's so much hype over the Boppy being a ""must have"" that I made sure to get one when our first baby was born. I was very disappointed. It is horribly designed for nursing a baby. The cushion was always slipping and sliding out of position. There is no way to strap it to your waist to keep it in place. For a nursing support pillow, I highly recommend the the ""My Brest Friend"" pillow instead. It's a flat crescent shaped pillow that straps around you and provides lumbar support as well. It made a world of difference for proper positioning, and latching on correctly. If you want a pillow for nursing support, save your money and skip the Boppy."
23606,-1,Bad Nike Shoe,"The Nike TRIAX Air Structure 10 I purchased had a very poorly made left shoe, leaning far to the left. It makes me wonder if it is a 'knock-off' instead of Nike. I'll stick to my old source and style."
23617,-1,An insight into the minds of young men with no rules,"This book conveyed a great message, but the naive characters were often not satisfactory heroes."
23618,-1,desappointing,"although paid extra for expedite delivery, this school required book was delivered a month later!"
23624,-1,A very boring book.,I might just be a teen in high school but I know what I like and this book was not one in my interest. Although William Gerald Golding wrote this worthwhile astonishing book it made no imapct to my opinion. The book was very well presented and had touching moments but lacked the realism that books have to maintain. Its moments of exitement were short lived and really weren't that exciting to begin with. All in all it was a hell of a book to those who actually like reading books. To tell the truth I hardly remember what the book was about.
23635,-1,lord of the flies bokk review,"""The lord of the flies"" By william Golding, is in my opinion one of the most boring book i have ever read in my whole life. but on the other hand it did have alot to say about our ""humanly nature"" most of it was true.This book was like a little summary of our violent nature throughout history. But overall it was terably boring!!!!!"
23648,-1,What a waste of time!!,I really hated this book. I only read it because I was forced to read it in school. I think that the author is trying too hard to write a good book. There must have been a reason why this was out on the market for 5 years before anyone picked it up. The author tells you too much information in a short amount of time. He starts to talk about something and then just moves on to something else. He also leaves you hanging. He also uses way too many uncompleted sentences! Reading this book was a complete and total waste of my time!!!!!!
23653,-1,What was Golding thinking?,"Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature."
23660,-1,briliant,This is probbably the best book i have ever read.it starts of good and gets better.it keeps geting better and the end is the best bit.if i had not read this book i would read it again.there are so many good bits.
23667,-1,The book has no practical information,"This book was terrible. I bought it in the hopes of learning something better than the normal mneumonic techniques;however,her book showed techniques that were impractical and plain dumb. For all those out there looking for a good book on memory that will really WORK!!!! Try Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas's The Memory Book. The techniques are easy to learn, but will take time to apply to information for school. However, you will be rewarded for your efforts."
23673,-1,Pure junk,"I'd always heard great things about numark products, so I decided to roll the dice on the PT01, a big mistake. The good, is that it is a light weight truly portable turntable. The built in speaker provides pretty good sound for being a small speaker. Why the 1 star? b/c the player is poorly constructed. The shiny top piece is poorly glued on, and pops up rubbing against the record while its playing. This causes the record to wobble and creates a very poor sound. I had to put a weight on the player to keep the piece from popping up in order for it to play properly. Little to say I will be staying away from numark products, and I highly recommend that anyone in the market for a player such as this look else where."
23681,-1,Typical new Asia - trying to re-write history,"Anthology, like the great Communist purges of 1930s and 40s, appears to be an attempt to act as if the past never happened. Why else would Geoff Downes think he could get away with re-recording the band's best-known hits with a singer-guitarist (John Payne) who can't hold a candle to either John Wetton or Steve Howe? Payne's re-makes are embarrasing, and the new stuff is woefully poor; as dreadful as the new material on ""Then & Now"" was, I'd rather listen to that compared with anything this disc has to offer."
23688,-1,DRIVEL,"This is not a good book; if you want real mystery, read P.D. James, Conan Doyle or a host of others.Robinson's character is gimmicky; the plot is gimmicky; his writing style is gimmicky.If you have insomnia, however, this would be a good book to purchase.Also, comparing Robinson to Grisham is like comparing a painter of Elvis Presley velvets to Leonardo Da Vinci. Robinson's not a real writer, let alone an artist."
23692,-1,THE WORST FAMOUS AMERICAN WRITER EVER BORN,Without a doubt Thomas Wolfe is the worst...I tried reading this book many years ago...it was awful and dull and boring beyond description...anyone who recomends this book must be a dullard.c
23700,-1,Woops,"Yeah, I am a big fan of moby, and accidentally buying the CD that almost ended his career doesn't shake that, if you want some good Moby might I suggest 18 or Play, this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise, but fail to build up to anything, everything else is Moby screaming in a traditional punk style, which were almost humorous, except, not [this much money] humorous, I am not a fan of this CD, I know he was starting out in a punk band, but his other stuff is much better"
23701,-1,Poor Quality.,The seat covers started coming loose at the seams immediately upon putting them on the seats.
23703,-1,I got it to work and still hated it.,"I have a Nokia 5190 from Cingular and eagerly ordered this unit. Cingular charged me a flat rate of $... a month just for datalink service, and then minutes on top of that, but that's not too expensive for wireless internet access.I got it installed and running in about 45 minutes and proceeded to try it out. I got so annoyed with the speed, the bulky cable, the connect time (~30 to 40 seconds) and the intermittent service, that I gave up and returned it.Don't bother."
23705,-1,I'd give it more stars if it worked!,"Well, the module seems to install just fine (make sure you move Mobilelink into flash or you'll crash your unit). I'm trying to use mine my color Prism. The only problem is that my Nokia 5190 doesn't want to cooperate, so I still haven't surfed with this thing yet. I get a ""Check Operator Services&quit; error on the screen of my Nokia, and it disconnects. Even so, I bought it because it was a lot cheaper than a wireless web module (hey, why buy the wireless hardware again - it's already in my phone), and I avoid a [monthly] charge for service. I just use my cell phone minutes, which is fine for brief email uploads/downloads. We'll see what happens to my cell phone bill once I get sucked into online surfing of the PDA-enabled websites. So, once I get around to calling Xircom for some help, I'll report back on this thing actually works."
23707,-1,Never been so disappointed by a good concept gone wrong,"The concept for this series is great, but it's done really badly, without going into details all the main characters are Jews who can do no wrong and everyone else is a belligerent fool, I was looking forward to a good military sci-fi and instead got what reads like political propaganda."
23717,-1,Seriously Boring,"Very unorganized, I couldn't even find a single myth in here by page 30. This is so not worth it."
23720,-1,See The Original and then comment!,"The story line is ok but the series sucks!See the Original movie with a fetching young Fairuza Balk as Mildred Hubble.Even my niece who's 7 hated this movie but loved the original. When she saw that there was a series on tape she made me buy the first one then cried when she saw it and wanted to break it.If you can, skip the music video by Curry and concentrate on the movie. You'll love it !!!!!!!!!!"
23723,-1,Lost Its Touch!!!!!,"this season really changed direction,its not even the same show anymore,hey and whats with Nancie and her change of personality(Her Character)its not her anymore,Conrad is gone the best person in the show,They Shoud just call the Show ""Drug War"" Now, not Weeds,this use to be my number 1 show,now its last,and Nancie has to be the biggest most Stupid Drug Dealer/Pusher,she would have been locked up in season 2 in real life, Another Un THought Out Drama Story"
23724,-1,Poor DVD Quality - Not Able to Watch,"We bought several seasons of Weeds during after Christmas sales last year. It took as a while to get around to watching them. However, on at least THREE seasons, the DVDs were damaged beyond being able to watch. Buying the seasons was such a WASTE since the DVDs are worthless. I do not recommend buying these DVDs. I have never had trouble with other DVDs purchased from Amazon."
23725,-1,Beware: region coded,"Unlike seasons 1 - 3 of Weeds, this blu-ray is region coded and will noy work on European players. I've bought a useless disc.Since Weeds is unavailable on blu-ray in my country (Holland), to me this means it's another example on how the industry discourages customers that like to buy their media legally. I guess I'll have to resort to downloading the rest of the series.At least we are able to buy real weed here legally."
23740,-1,I hate it,"After reading the book and having the pleasure of meeting the authors in Missouri, all I can say...nothing new here. If you consider ripping off existing fly patterns revolutionary...go ahead, buy the book. Buy some Tony Accardo flies and poppers and take your hat off to a true master."
23746,-1,Wake Me When It's Over!!,"Enticed by the title, I bought this audio to help me out of the slump I've been in. While there are some good suggestions, this guy is BORING! One of his suggestions to motivate yourself is to do 2 things that you dislike doing everyday--I guess so that you will enjoy the things you do like even more. It was this thought that motivated me to get through to the end of this tape"
23748,-1,Overly complicated,"Being both a U.S. history buff and a mystery fan, I expected to love this book. I gave up after slogging through 150 pages. New characters (many with similar names) are introduced about every other page, making the story very difficult to keep straight. Benjamin January also brings a multi-layered backstory to the proceedings, adding additional layers of complexity (and does anybody else think a musician-surgeon-classically educated sensitive widower is a bit too good to be true?).Add a setting unfamiliar to most readers (an 1830s Creole sugar cane plantation), and the density of details overwhelms both plot and characterization. Casual readers will find this book tough sledding."
23750,-1,Didn't hold up.....very disappointed,"I bought this OXO Insight Tea Kettle tea after I'd let my former whistler boil dry. The whistling cover on the spout had been left in the ""UP"" position after filling and I totally forgot about it. Well, I thought, THIS teakettle had solved that problem for me. Just a squeeze of the handle causes the spout top to flip down into the spout. When the the kettle is set down and the handle released, the spout top closes. What a great idea!After just 6 months of light use, the spout top will no longer close. I am so disappointed. FYI, the whistle on it was great, not too irritating, but loud enough to get one's attention.I am on the hunt for a new teakettle. A stainless one with a non-irritating whistle --- some of these teakettles sound like a tornado siren."
23756,-1,this is WACK it deserves no stars,I would like to know what type of people are writing these reviews and what state of musical knowledge they have i've never written a review but after reading what these plutocrates have wrote i have to respond this cd is on par with Ant and Dec its terrible she waffles on with an annoying high piched voice about english mcs sounding american then she tries to sound like a cracked out missy elliot who also is terrible she has absolutely zero talent and im amazed she has a record deal its borders on treason that shes allowed to hold a mic
23758,-1,Waste Of Money,"Followed the instructions just like it said. My pictured all came out in a pinkish-red, had tothrow the cartdridge away. A big waste of time and money. I wont buy it again."
23759,-1,Misleading Title.,"This book's title and its thesis ""seem"" to suggest that it is all about the impact of people on politics, but in fact it is about feminism. The topic, feminism, is fine; anything under disguise is not.It is not quite an academic book with logical arguments but rather a propaganda with a few claims that are appealing accompanied by loads of emotional examples exposing the unfairness of this world which do nothing to strengthen the previous claims."
23762,-1,Visioneer doesn't honor its warrenty,My visioneeer scanner broke down after 3 months of use ... Visioneer isn't standing up to its warrenty claims.
23764,-1,"Good Story, Bad Writing, Bad Acting, Bad Directing","And worst of all was the techno music, which in no way fit the setting of the film."
23770,-1,Stink! Stank! Stunk!,"Unbelievably stupid and inane. Chris Lambert has the acting ability of a limp dish rag. If you haven't seen a pseudo-martial arts film that spends most of its time having the actors sommersault backwards again and again and again and again to a soundtrack filled with WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!, then this film is for you. And the fact that this film is based on what is considered the first English language literary classic is sacrilegious. Everyone associated with this film should be subjected to that huge single-edged razor blade used to separate people shown in the beginning of the film. This goes down in my books as one of the biggest bombs of all time. And Chris Lambert is positively laughable as an actor. Bar this man from acting!! Trash this film or--better--use it to prep people in how NOT to make a film."
23772,-1,Package fine; pan bent or warped and they shipped it anyway!,"I would assume whoever packages these items, looks at them -- this should be a round pan -- not a dented pan. The box was not damaged, airpacks around the pan. Pan has a serious dent -- not a minor dent. Watch what you buy"
23774,-1,Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?,"After 20+ years you would've thought Temple could have made a film without rehashing swindle. 99% of the footage has been seen before, the only new stuff is the interviews carried out in pitch darkness - probably sounded good in theory, in reality it is profoundly dull.No complete performances, overdubbed music, endless footage of council flats, endless rehashed footage from Swindle. A complete and utter wasted opportunity.Ever get the feelin you've been cheated?"
23776,-1,Time to Revitalize,"I think I have read everything Hillerman has written. Hunting Badger, is, at least in my opinion, his worst work. We already know Chee, Leaphorn and the other staple characters. Very disappointingly, Hunting Badger has no character development of the antagonists, no suspenseful plot and no real conclusion. This book seems to me to be a ""My editors want another book."" piece. I look forward to additional Hillerman books with hope that he will again do his usual interesting charatcer development as well as geographically detailed work. But, as far as Hunting Badger goes, miss it. It isn't very good. jbd"
23778,-1,A misstep in the series,"I've been a fan of the Hillerman series for many years, but Hunting Badger represents a great disappointment. I only hope that most new readers begin with another book in the series--any other would do. Also, why name a book after the villain if you're not going to confront or even glimpse him in the book? I felt as though Hillerman simply got tired and quit before he wrote the final chapters. Lots of typos and poor editing throughout. Maybe he had a falling-out with the publisher."
23782,-1,This stuff is absolutely NASTY!!,"I have no idea who is submitting the 5* reviews here, but they lost their taste buds years ago.This stuff tastes nothing like salt. It has a horrible bitter after-taste that lingers in your mouth ruining anything it touches.Try it at a restaurant or something before buying it. It even nauseates in cooking or in recipes requiring any significant amount of salt.If you are on a salt free diet, find something else. Yuk! With a capital Yuk!!=============UPDATE=====================I have found one use for this. In cooking, with tomato sauce, if you mix it with real salt, you need much less salt. The tomato sauce appears to nullify the bitterness somehow. So, if you like pasta with sauce but have to cut down on salt intake, perhaps this is the answer for that.But it is NO salt shaker for the table."
23791,-1,GREAT movie - TERRIBLE DVD,"This is by far one of my all time favorite movies. My wife always loved it, so has my 3-year old boy. So we went ahead and purchased this movie on DVD. However, how annoying is it when the DVD doesn't allow you to skip the previews of other insignificant movies before you actually get to see the feature film. This thing locks up your DVD player control completely (disables functions of menu / stop / fast forward) and forces you to sit through previews of five movies before ever getting to the Babe feature. It is simply the most offensive and intruding thing my family has ever experienced in DVD's and VHS.I have a lot of words to describe those folks at Universal Studio, I will try to be gentle. Let's just put it this way - your limited creativity in marketing really must be the ultimate lowest of all."
23795,-1,Too sad!!!,"I'm sorry, but my eyes were filled with tears through the entire movie!!! Sure, it's nice seeing the animals talk, but it's SOO 'darn' sad! It's just another depressing animal movie.If you love animals and want a good bawl, this movie's for you."
23798,-1,skimmed to the end,"This reminded me of a Nancy Drew story in which Nancy gets laid, more than once. If this seems vulgar, then prepare yourself for a big surprise if you read this book. Contrived ""in the nick of time"" encounters hobble the already weak suspense, and stereotypes abound. You'll be happier with some James Lee Burke."
23799,-1,Non-stick Coating Wore Off and is Chipping After Three Months,I bought this pan with high expectations given the strong reviews from other customers but after a few months of use I am very disappointed. The pan takes several coats of oil to prevent food from sticking and now the non-stick surface is beginning to flake off. I always washed the pan by hand and never used anything other than plastic cooking utensils. The last non-stick pan I had was Kirkland brand and it lasted four years.
23801,-1,not a pure grade/ too big/ hard to swallow & digest,"I won't ever buy it again. I was looking for pure grade and easy to digest, but with citrate. Big mistake!"
23806,-1,"Incomplete, missing musicians","This release is missing two of the songs from the original performance at Woodstock, ""Gypsy Woman"" and ""Mastermind."" Hendrix only performed these songs at the Woodstock show; therefore, their historic value is impossible to deny. Yet these songs are not on this release!Additionally, this album does not include some of the other musicians' performances. The guitar of Larry Lee, for example, has been mixed out, along with other percussion and singing.This release could have been the definitive edition of Jimi Hendrix's legendary performance at Woodstock. Instead, it represents almost nothing beyond the 1994 Alan Douglas :Woodstock release."
23809,-1,NO TITLE,Instant Immersion American Sign Language DeluxeTried using this DVD. Came without instructions. Never use it.Not recommended.
23812,-1,not worth the money,"I generally expect to get what I pay for...I think I paid $15 for this thing so I really wasn't expecting much from it. Well that's exactly what I got. Even from as little as 7 feet away, my signal strength was under 50% and sometimes would totally go away. I wish I wouldn't have wasted that money - don't waste yours. This is one product Airlink shouldn't have put out."
23814,-1,Is being a Witch really this hard????,"This was one of the first books I picked up when I first started studying the Craft, right along with Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practioner. I found it as alot of jibberish, granted there was some decent parts, most of it seemed like it was written for her and only her and those she teaches. I found most of it difficult to understand, and her version of the Craft seemed so organized; for instance, your altar MUST look like this. Needless to say, Cunninghams book I finished, Ms Cabot's, I did not."
23819,-1,Don't be fooled!,"Sounds up to date, and I bought it thinking it new, but tired forecasts from 1990 can easily be beaten by anyone of average thinking from the vantagepoint of 2000. Avoid and think for yourself instead!"
23822,-1,Not entirely original...,"Actually everything in the book IS helpful, and a OK read... but most of the material is FREE on the net already.The stuff from ""The Layguide"" was mirrored on all kinds of websites all over the place before it ever became print. If you search for keywords like ""layguide"" and ""player guide"" on the net, you will find this stuff is basically plagaurized. It was just a compilation of a bunch of usenet posts.Now, if you really want something in print, and original too, do yourself a favor now and go buy ""The Art of Seduction"" by Robert Greene, also available here on Amazon.com. The guy researched great seducers and seductions throughout history, and came up with types of seducers, the stages of seduction, etc. And his work is entirely original as well."
23826,-1,This is HORRIBLE! Follow this if you want to get cold cocked!,"Seriously, I bought this for my 20 year old son to completely embarrass him. Well he refused to take it so it sat in the backseat of my car. My friend from out of town (who I was carting around the city doing touristy stuff) picks it up and starts reading it out loud to all of us. It says such horrible bad bad BAD advise. If you follow this guide you will be slapped. NO DOUBT. And possibly knocked out, depending on who you approach. This is from 2 chicks and one dude who are very open minded. You will NOT get anything other than a fat lip if you do even ONE of the things it tells you to do. So actually i think this should be in the comedy section. My kid is pretty smart *gloating*.I can't believe IDIOTS are following this advice and giving it good reviews! Ridiculous!"
23837,-1,these are either seconds or bootleg merch... do not buy.,"I unfortunately bought a bunch of these as well, and even though they are packed in Gillette packaging (foil printing and all!)... they are not the real deal.As a longtime Mach 3 user and head shaver... I can tell you without a doubt that these are discards or bootlegs.The ""gel strip"" is fake or poorly done and the blades are not very sharp, which resulted in me, unhappy and bleeding.I sent a pack to Gillette, waiting for their reply. Contacted seller... no response.buyer beware."
23839,-1,Made me sad...,"I just don't get it. A just-barely-OK lengthy take of ""Interstellar"" with footage including some weird (not at all in a good/interesting way...I mean weird that anyone decided that it was relevant to the Floyd) faux-psychedelic documentary about London circa '66/'67 interspersed with precious few live clips (again, not that bomb...some footage finds PF looking about as enthused as a kid in church) and you have this perplexingly disappointing release. This is almost bootleg level in terms of editing quality and intention as a piece of art but that besmirches the good name of the better quality bootlegs I've enjoyed in my life. This so totally sucks and was probably only vaguely authorized by the band. It certainly seems designed to slip into the ""gimme everything"" filterless, fanboy bloodstream. Which is a shame. Don't waste your money. Even if you're hardcore...it just might make you angrier..."
23841,-1,Cover not glazed - becomes rancid,The base is glazed. The cover is not and quickly becomes infused with oil which then turns rancid. The whole thing smells like death.
23843,-1,I have got two words to descibes what I thought of this...,"AND THAT IS BORING AND SNOBISH! I watched the first two hours of this and coudn't keep awake. The narritor's voice was monotone. I wanted to shout at his pompous, snobish demeanor SHUT UP!! In my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god's peoples. With the narritor, granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko. When you take people on a educating journey (such as nine hours long) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home. I felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like I was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours. I am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this DVD set back to the library and saying ""Check Please""."
23844,-1,Update of the old book,"It was a rather frustrating book since it was just an update of the previous generation book for VC++ 6.0. It seems that SAMS wanted to be the first to sell in order to sell. This is rather bad for the company since it will lose many of its potential customers in the future. The only chapters worth reading, well at least a little bit, are chapters 19 and 21 and nothing more."
23846,-1,Thanks for Robbing Me of my Money,"I would just like to thank the Sinclair Institute for robbing me and the other 4 million people who bought their videos of our money.I cannot believe that someone would produce something that is this terrible.Let me save you some money. This video reveals no ""SECRETS"" to sex and no ""AMAZING"" positions. The Doctors that give the advice provide a lot of Medical Mumbo Jumbo.Let me save you some money. The video has bad actors filmed in a terrible setting. It looks like a bad 70s adult flick. Yes a 70s film. Nothing from this millennium that's for sure.As for an overall synopsis: Pay attention to your lover and try to satisfy them. Try different places and positions for sex. And oh yes, men and women love oral sex. Come on Sinclair, everyone knows that.Thanks but no thanks..."
23847,-1,Don't be fooled. Save your money.,"I purchased the Better Sex Videos with my boyfriend because we were looking for something new for our relationship. Well I purchased this DVD with their Sexual Positions For Lovers - Beyond the Missionary Position.What a mistake. When the DVD arrived I noticed that the couples are not attractive (turn off for both of us), the quality was terrible, and the information provided was basic information that everyone knows. As for the positions, they are general positions that anyone knows.This company claims that they have sold 4 million videos. I wonder how many returns they have gotten out of those 4 million.I would give this and the Sexual Positions For Lovers - Beyond the Missionary Position zero stars if I could. Don't be fooled. Save your money.If you are looking for a great sex position DVD, try: Sex Essentials Videos: Seductive Sex Positions. Also another great DVD (for the females out there) is Female Masturbation : Every Woman's Orgasm is Unique."
23848,-1,Legion: A Lesion on the movie industry!,"Terry Farrell, Rick Springfield, Parker Stevenson, Corey Feldman are the ""headline"" actors in this flat and slow moving Sci-Fi Channel exclusive. None of them are directed to their potential in this excuse of an ""Aliens"" wannabe. Poor storyline also contributes. Only buy this if you are a deranged fan of one of the actors and you want to throw away a hundred bucks."
23853,-1,"If you desire easy control for your game, this is Not it.","Graphics are okay. This is a pretty clean version from the computer version. However, getting around the game is not easy. This is not for beginners or people who like to be precise. The aim will move around everywhere and it feels like you can't get the screen to sit still for a second so you can blast an alien."
23865,-1,A waste of money,"I gave myself enough time to review with this book, but it didn't help me at all. I wound up desperately searching for my old school notes to help me understand what the book was trying to explain. I struggled to absorb the information in the book because there was so much of it, and after I took the test I found out that most of it was extraneous. I got a 630 on the test, and while that isn't a terrible score, I bought the book in hopes of working up to somewhere near a 700. I could have gotten a 630 on my own, without wasting my money on this book.There has to be a better review book than this. Try as hard as you can to find something else."
23869,-1,Pass for now.,"Another great film, ruined with two channel audio tracks. Wait to buy this one in surround sound. Maybe Image will get the hint, and use the technology available to them."
23870,-1,Freezes,"The DVD freezes on the first chapter, that's the reason I chose this rating. The movie is a great movie itself. Just this DVD sucks. I would recommend the movie but not the seller."
23871,-1,Missing scenes that were in when it was in the theater.,"Good movie, except they released the DVD like the VHS tape version, all cut up. The entire battle of Coral Sea is missing. The restored and full length version is currently being aired on TNT occasionally."
23879,-1,DO NOT BUY THIS COPY!!!,This copy is only a low-quality PHOTOCOPY book of the original one. DO NOT BUY THIS. It is not worth your money.I am very disappointed to find out Amazon allows this item on shelf.
23884,-1,What a sick disappointment,"I watched this film hoping for a great revenge flick, in which the victim of a brutal rape enacts the revenge on her assailents like they deserve. Unfortunately what I saw was a film about a woman who gets raped, the details being the main focus of the movie, and a bit thrown in at the end about her getting revenge by killing the guys. Only the bath tub guy gets what he deserves. The other guys all get relatively quick and painless deaths. They should be killed like the victims in ""Saw"", but they actually seem to get off pretty easily.The fact that the rape scene is around forty minutes long proves the misguidedness of the film makers. It's like using the movie ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to say that murder is wrong. It just doesn't work to throw the subject in our face and force us to stare at it.I just feel like this movie screams to be remade, with the rape being downplayed, and the revenge being emphasized. It could have been done far better."
23893,-1,I Spit On Your Grave,After no word for three weeks I was sent a message that I had been sent notice that the product was unavailable. Not true. The message arrived the day after the last day that I was to expect it. I would have appreciated a timely message so I could look somewhere else. Instead the import CD wasted three weeks of my time.
23899,-1,Garbage,"The only people I can see really trying to get this flick are poor souls in the UK who are curious as to why it was banned. I'll tell you why it should have been banned. Unfortunately in Britain they still censor and ban films, which is a joke, and people become obsessed with these ""nasty"" flick, most of them being just plain bad. Save your money, American or British, and pass over this poor excuse for a film."
23902,-1,only pricks like this film,"This movie is just fake snuff. Thats it. Its boring, laughable, and not scary or disturbing in the least. Watch Last House on the Left, now thats scary!!"
23906,-1,i am still in a hole,"this game, sorry this item is not unfinished but it shouldn't even be in the market. Not only was it impossible to complete, it made me gag every time i hear the E.T. theme song. This game should be extreme punishment for kids to suffer if they misbehave or break something valuable. Please save your green dollars and go buy Call of Duty Black Ops II or Halo 4. Definetly the worst thing to be called a video game before Superman 64."
23928,-1,Doesn't straighten my hair,"I have extra long wavy thick hair. I've always wanted to be able to straighten my hair on my own without having someone else's help or going to a salon. This does dry my hair, but it doesn't make it straight, it always makes my hair frizzier and more dull. I would not recommend this product."
23933,-1,Too Many Omissions to Count...,"The name of the film is American Hardcore, but never once mentioned are seminal Hardcore legends Reagan Youth, Warzone and the Angry Samoans. The Dead Kennedys, Misfits, Husker Du, 7 Seconds and Suicidal Tendencies are briefly mentioned and in no way given their due. Much of the running time of the documentary focuses on the California, Boston and DC scenes. But how can you cover Cali in depth without delving deep into the Dead Kennedys? The film is completely disjointed and has no rhyme or reason as they move from California to Boston back to California to DC and then briefly to New York. I know the intention was good but the product is subpar and heinously omits bands that should have gotten their 15 minutes for their contributions to this important underground scene. Not recommended."
23942,-1,I did not even finish this book,"I was told that Amanda Cross was a good mystery writer and looked forward to reading some of her works. After reading 4 of these short stories, I put the book down and will not look for any more of her works.I tried to over look the excessive use of fractured compound sentences, but the bizarre resolution of the stories was more than I could bear."
23945,-1,ATTENTION! NOT WHAT YOU THINK!,The movie itself is FANTASTIC BUT beware that this is NOT the original 1986 movie. It's the Special Collectors Edition that's been remastered and includes foul language. The only way you'd know that is if you happened to mouse over one of the extra thumbnail images (and who does that?!).
23979,-1,"More Like ""Royal Rape""","The so-called ""hero"" of this book is nothing more than a rapist. For goodness sake, the first time they get together, he throws her down, holds her down and rapes her, and yet this is somehow supposed to be seen as romantic.This book is sickening. It does not deserve to be called a romance novel."
23980,-1,Not a great book!,This is absurd. I don't know how the other reviewers judged this book. It is based on [assault] of an innocent girl and coersion. I'm forced to give a 1 star because no stars is not an option. The author is way off base in this one. I stopped reading the book when the prince mistook Angeline for Claire and proceeded to [assault] her.
24016,-1,PRUNELLA SCALES NO HEIGHTS,"I've always been a fan of the British actress Prunella Scales and already own some of her readings of classic novels, including Cranford which she handles delightfully.So it was a big disappointment to find that she seems to have completely misjudged her narration of Emma. One of the pleasures of a Jane Austen novel is the author's deceptively quiet tone; its very understatement sharpens her satire and makes her jokes even funnier. Unfortunately, Miss Scales has adopted the opposite approach, using a hopelessly inappropriate shrill, impatient voice. Given that the opening chapters are dominated by two of literature's most tiresome characters, Emma Woodhouse and her feebleminded father, the result is unbearably irritating. I gave up after an hour, and was glad to track down a far more enjoyable reading by Juliet StevensonEmma (Classic Fiction)- by far the best Austen narrator on the market today."
24017,-1,Don't waste your time or money,"I bought this book because my book group had chosen it for a ""classic"" read. I can't imagine why anyone would waste their time and money on this book. I could barely get through the first 50 pages or so until I gave up on it. As far as I'm concerned, the characters were worthless and their activities were pointless. Why anyone still reads Jane Austen is beyond me. If this book is an example of her writing, it is terrible! People in my book group said her other works are better but I won't be reading them."
24023,-1,bernard and miss bianca should have died,"i would have loved that. The movie is stupid, its boring. plus there were too many dirty jokes :("
24025,-1,Rescuers,DVD did not work. Still trying to figure out how to get my money back. If you can help let me know. Thanks
24026,-1,Miss Bianca! What have they done to you?!,"Eek! Eek! Eek! This is absolutely the worst movie experience I've had in weeks. Horrid adaptation of Margery Sharp's novels, not only that, but a total failure as a film on its own! There's just no point to this movie. Where the first one ended should have been the end. Nothing happens here that relates to the first movie, there was no need for it at all!But to have Miss Bianca and Bernard marry?! That's like shooting Margery Sharp! She would never have allowed such atrocity!! What were the film makers thinking?! Turning Margery Sharp's soft, warm and sophisticated novels into an action, cliché romance film...? Makes you want to throw up!Totally disgusted!!"
24029,-1,Teletubbies bedtime stories and nursery rhymes,I am not sure why they say this is not published yet because I purchased this for my 2 yr.old son for Christmas 2000. I do not recommend this video at all. It only makes my son wilder at bedtime. There is no routine for bedtime and it is always daylight during the video and the other teletubbies just laugh. I laughed at myself for buying it.
24032,-1,Errors Noted In The Content,There are incorrect items written about in a number of the topics discussed in this book. When you buy a book you want to know you paid for correct advice and information. Some items were helpful but I wonder how many other issues are wrong that I didn't check into further.
24046,-1,"Frightfully BORing, ol' chap","When I read that Hollinghurst had a new book out, and a prize-winner at that, I was really looking forward to reading it. I requested it from my public library and had to wait a couple of months for it to become available. After part 1, pg. 160 (Nick's first ""love"" affair), the book was due back, and I gladly returned it. Read the other 1-star reviews, and I TOTALLY agree with those in-depth reviews.I found it impossible to ""relate"" to and/or care about ANY of the characters in this book--two important criteria for a ""good"" book-- in my opinion."
24051,-1,"Boring, boring, boring","I found reading the book very tedious. He takes chapters to say very little. I had to read the book for a book club, or I wouldn't have finished it."
24055,-1,Do not buy REMANUFACTURED from this outlet!,"I received a broken waffle maker. Sent it back, received another broken waffle maker. Both were broken due to poor packing. They both were broke in a place that could not be fixed to be operational.Save the headache and buy the newer Waring Pro PROFESSIONAL waffle maker with the fold down handle. If you shop around you can find one for about ten buck more than the remanufactured cleaper line for a much better waffle maker, and brand new! Would NOT recommend rebuilt on this item. Would give ZERO stars not one! Also bad customer service."
24072,-1,Dont' waste your $$$...breaks within 6 months!,We bought this showerhead so it could help our skin and my dd's eczema. It was great while it lasted but now cracked in 2 places and is unusable. I can't believe I paid over $60 for it!
24082,-1,This is a literary masterpiece???????,"The book consists of an overabundance of mini-stories that are irrelevant to each other and there is no real plot. If you took this book into a publisher nowadays, he or she would probably throw it at you and then laugh in your face. I had to have been published on a dare, then banned as a publicity stunt. If you want to read it, I would suggest going to the library. Don't waste your money."
24093,-1,James Joyce Needed an Editor,"How could a book like Ulysses ever have made it to print? The grammar is so disjointed as to make it nearly impossible to read. Additionally, the point-of-view and writing style change in nearly every chapter after the sixth. It should also be mentioned that the story is not very well paced. The book is well over 600 pages long, but the events in the story appear to take place over the course of just a single day.I have heard numerous people praise this book, but that would seem to be largely posturing because the story is lost under the weight of inadequate editing."
24102,-1,Such a wretched waste of time,"Yes, ULYSSES is a mainstay of college literature. Yes, the book is a worthy literary endeavor. But for those who are not brutally devoted to the endless pursuit of mind-numbing genius, ULYSSES is tiresome, tedious, and passe. The appeal of reading the mind wanderings of a pasty, weak pseudo-intellectual grows stale after the first dozen pages. For those enterprising readers such as myself who feel guilty dumping a Joyce work after only a chapter, read on. It gets worse. Confession: the genius mind-maze that is Joyce is sometimes just not worth exploring. One would have better luck escaping the Minotaur than successfully exiting this lingual labyrinth. (Dr. Marcus Smith: I apologize for this heresy against the Modern Epic.)"
24110,-1,Total waste of time. . .,"I've alread wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this movie. And beleive me that's time I'd like to have back. It pains me to have to spend anymore time dwelling on this drivel.There are two major problems with this film. First and foremost it's not funny. Maybe I missed an e-mail or a memo or something but I thought comedies were supposed to be funny. And secondly why is this movie "" unrated "". I saw nothing in here that wouldn't have been above a PG-13. My only guess is that without "" unrated "" plastered on the cover it wouldn't have appealed to such a wide audience.The four writers who had nothing to do with this movie have to be some of the smartest people in the world. So if you're eyeing this movie in the rental store, my only advice to you is to slowly back away and move on to the next movie on your list. Do that and you'll be lucky enough to be considered in the same breath as those four writers...some of the smartest people in the world."
24113,-1,Unrated?,"I'm tired of all these movies claiming to be the Unrated Version and not offering a single thing that wouldn't be included without exception in a PG-13 movie. Add to that only seven or eight decent laughs in the whole movie and I'm pretty ticked-off. Explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie, so I won't do it.Tried and true spoof formula is not properly hashed out in cheap attempt to cash-in on quarter-of-a-century craze(Airplane 1980). Top Secret, Hot Shot, Hot Shot Part Deux and Not Another Teen Movie are much examples of this (art) form.Might have given it two stars if they left the Unrated off the box.A lot more of Josh Meyers might have helped."
24123,-1,always laugh at these parody movies...but not this one...,"The movie was funny the first, oh lets say about maybe the first 20-40 minutes. After that the movie is garbage. The humor and mocking was so dis-tasteful and a little offensive. The cat in the bathroom, ""dead mrs.jones"", the little jokes by the bachellor's parents, the bizarre family relationships, and the mock-sexual references to sex.I was very surprised at myself when i viewed the film. I hardly laughed and didnt laugh when I needed. Like I said I totally love these not another teen movie, scary movie type films...but Date Movie is pure garage. The humor is so awful and the mockery sucks tooBottom line: Horrible movie...never watching it again."
24127,-1,this is a waste of time!!!,"the movies on this disc might be good,but from the very poor transfers here(droped audio,picture drop-out and freese pictures ,and all the movies were very very dark almost not watchable)you would never know. skip this mess and look for these movies elsewere!!!"
24128,-1,Trash,"Infantile depiction of politics, sex, and Panama itself. Insulting screenplay for the viewer. The movie is pure bravado and seems made-up on the fly. No sense of understanding for the people or politics of Panama. Shockingly bad."
24133,-1,A really stupid flick.,"I had a back pain, needed to lie down, and decided to look in the local newspaper what was on TV. This movie was listed with a 3-star (out of 4) rating, so I picked it to watch. I guess they would have given 3 stars to anything bashing American and British imperialism with its devilish plans against the proud people of Panama (which, if you don't know, is a Central American country, located where the canal is). There is absolutely nothing in this film to even partially redeem its incredibly silly premise. I first thought that the leading actor was James Woods, but it turned out to be another guy, what put the final nail in the coffin of my opinion. Save yourself the trouble."
24136,-1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!","I saw this a few weeks ago with a friend, both of us kept looking at our watches to see how much longer before the torture would end, this movie was SLOW SLOW SLOW, with no real plot. It had some great actors in it too bad they were in such a horrible movie!"
24139,-1,Unwatchable,"This is one of those films that are made to capitalize on star power, get quick results at the box office, and then disappear into the land of forgotten films.About a half hour into this debacle, which featured whiny children, predictable plotting, and overall lack of likable (or believable) characters, I was forced to just turn it off."
24147,-1,Really aweful movie!,Extremely boring with a very weak storyline. This is compounded by the fact that it is very poorly executed. You will start snoring after the first 10 minutes as you realize that there is no character development at all! This movie was so aweful it put me off from seeing other movies for a week...it was that bad! Minus 2 stars!
24153,-1,More Groans Than Laughs,"Weak, derivative, and thoroughly unfunny - classic example of a studio cashing in with the old Good Movie Rehash. (...). Although what's funny and what isn't is often a matter of opinion, the element of surprise is what defines humor. We laugh when the unexpected happens. But having seen it all before in the original, nothing - and I mean NOTHING - is funny in Airplane 2. Even the new jokes are variations on a theme. Save your money and watch Airplane! twice."
24154,-1,Airplane 2 Crashes,"Sequels are often cheap imitations of the original and more often than not, they're usually pretty bad. And ""Airplane 2: The Sequel"" is no exception. The producers and writers of this lackluster endeavor obviously didn't put a lot of thought or effort into making this film. Much of the material is nothing more than a variation of what was in the original ""Airplane!,"" which makes for a rather dull and predictable movie.In ""Airplane 2,"" the writers do try to vary the plot a bit by changing the venue to the 21st century but this does more harm than good. This futuristic setting has some comic aspects but it never really connects with the audience. There are also some futile attempts at political/ethnic/sexual humor but they too fall flat.This is a second-rate movie that never gets off the ground. Don't waste your money on it."
24160,-1,Utterly charmless.,"Surely this marks the end of Madonna's movie ""career"".To be quite honest it's not entirely her fault.The Next Best Thing is victim to flat direction and an awful script.Is this really the same John Schlesinger who made a film called Midnight Cowboy over thirty years ago?..."
24166,-1,Tragic.....,"The best that can be said is that this movie kept me watching...I kept waiting for Madonna to 1) figure out where her accent was coming from and 2) let go of the stiff, tense, and downright atrocious acting. Look, I'm not anti-Madonna. In fact, I wanted to like this movie and I still applaud the theory of a ""family movie with a twist"". However, this movie was truly horrid. The acting was so appauling I cringed everytime a laugh was expected. If you are interested in a dumbfounding waste of time, watch ""The Next Best Thing."" Side note: I'm horrified that this was the same director who brought us ""Midnight Cowboy""!!"
24167,-1,The next best thing to tonsilectomy!,"I just had my tonsils taken out, and that was the most painful experience of my life. Watching this movie was a close second.Madonna has got to be the worst actress to get on a movie screen. Her inability to express any emotion is uncanny. Rupert is no better. Just because someone speaks with an English accent, that doesn't make him a good actor (as some reviewers tend to think). He literally competes with Madonna throughout the entire movie to see who will put the least effort and emotion in a scene. At least Madonna has got her music to fall back on. The plot is so silly that it doesn't even deserve a mention. The dramatic turn, half way through the movie, only makes the actors more uncomfortable, becoming even more unconvincing.Please, Madonna, stick to your music. We love your albums, but your movies stink!"
24184,-1,"1 star for the edition, 3 for the movie","Not a very great sequel (like most), but come on, enough already with the double dipping. Granted, we all KNEW this would come out as soon as they announced the third film (I don't count any film starring a has been wrestler as a sequel, sorry, that's just how I roll). Seems we get two new featurettes, and again, as SOON as the third film comes out on DVD, there'll be ANOTHER re-release. Wait for that one, I'm sure it will be ""fantastic."""
24191,-1,This should have been a good movie...,"but it really wasn't. The returning characters display none of the character traits that made them entertaining in the first movie. The movie simply careens, in a nearly plot free fashion, from one set-piece of computer enhanced combat to another. Now, I like a good, violent action movie as much as the next guy, but this one wasn't good. Watching it reminded me of watching somebody play the ""Mortal Kombat"" type video games of the 90's. If the producers had spent half of what went toward special effects on a better script, this movie could have lived up to its predecessor."
24198,-1,It stunk,This movie isnt even worth rental.Everthing was boring and the mummy was fully regenerated in the first 30 minutes.It wasnt evenworth the one star it got.
24202,-1,THIS MOVIE [STINKS],"Normally I would never write a review, I just don't. But as we have all learned from this past week, terror stirrs us to action. Don't even spend time thinking about spending money on this movie. This movie was almost as bad as Battlefield Earth! Plus, it is in some pre-order competition with the Simpson's Complete 1st season, so don't let the world think that this moivie is even a little good! Help Brendan Fraiser save the world from the Mummy, by not buying it, or even talking about it, or saying the name of the movie out loud!"
24205,-1,What a waste of time,"This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector's Edition. The picture quality is excellent. The DTS soundtrack (yes, this is standard on the R4 DVD unlike the R1)is of reference quality and quite outstanding in dynamic range (especially in the water-wall sequence). Unfortunately, the film was a total waste of time and I think studios should be paying audiences to watch films like this. No where near as good as the original -very formulaic and it felt almost like a cartoon with its over reliance on CGI. I scanned through most of the movie and I feel sorry for everyone who thinks this is worth buying. Even if a free copy was offered I would not accept -because I would never watch it again! And the bonus materials! Who cares about this when the film is so pathetic. I hope I'm not a minority who thinks film substance is still more important than its technical merits. I have invested in home theatre to enjoy films not gunfire, car chases and explosions."
24209,-1,Help!!! I'm Melting...,"I bought this as one of my mom's Christmas gifts. Within 2 days the spout cover (not sure if that is the proper name) was melting! The tea kettle was barely used and was not burned or mistreated. Needless to say, I have returned this item for one without a plastic spout cover.Good luck if you actually buy this kettle! I am shocked because OXO usually has great products!"
24215,-1,Mission Horrible,"Mission Impossible TV Series had some bad chapters especially duringthe Sixth and Seventh Seasons. However, these Episodes were muchbetter than this Film starring Tom Cruise. This is really a horriblemovie."

24218,-1,Only if You Love Tom Cruise,"And unfortunately so many people do. Blatant vanity project, the movie's saved only when director Brian DePalma kicks in with his brand of blazing comic book action - which is great, yes, but not enough this time around. Complicated plot? Phooey. Annoying is more like it."
24226,-1,disturbing,We received this book as a gift. I like the photo illustration concept but the book content itself is disturbing. There are so many better books out there to spend your money on.
24229,-1,A creepy book,"I did read this as a child, and though I could not have articulated the unpleasant feeling it gave me--I never liked it, that sad, vaguely arlarmed, looking doll, or the text. As an adult I find it very creepy. The doll who is so lonely and invites in a domineering father figure. THe bottom-up spanking is the illustration frequently complained about but they all invoke lonliness and passivity for me."
24231,-1,Awful Recording,"While I do appreciate the performing skill of American Brass Band, I have to say that the quanlity of CD one of the worst I have ever seen. Noise (probably generated at recording process) almost overwhelms the music. There is no way you can possibly appreciate a CD like that. It is (inexpensive), but still not worth it."
24243,-1,Much Ado About Nothing,"Despite of having the hand of a true great director at the helm and a multi-star cast (including a top-notch soundtrack by U2), the movie lacks the rhythm and charisma needed to live up to its expectations, with great performances lost in a bad script. It's just a wanna-be art movie, and nothing else."
24251,-1,"I liked the backcover blurb, but...","This book was romantic drivel. It made me think it was pulled directly from the pages of an early 1970s Harlequin. While wonderful at the time, this book will leave today's modern romance reader cold. Latter Day Saints, this is a book you can sink your teeth into."
24254,-1,"Awful, awful, awful","I was asked by Amazon to review this purchased book. Which I had ordered based on a Nabukov recommendation as the greatest book ever, etc., etc. I couldn't get past the first few pages. It hurts to read it. Really. It's painful. But then at times, so is Nabukov. And I've read Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, all great, deservedly so. And never painful."

24268,-1,irritatingly idiotic,"Huge fan of both Norton and Stiller, enough so that hearing that either of them is playing the lead in any movie is enough to get me to watch it. Nevertheless, this was the worst work I know of either of them doing . . . and they did it together!While the idea of two guys vying for a former childhood playmate is certainly a viable premise for a romantic comedy, I simply wasn't able to swallow the idea of their being a Catholic priest and Jewish rabbi respectively. Not for a second; and since everything that came after depended on your swallowing this, the film was painful to watch.And overlong. Just when you think it's about time to wrap up things, you check the Display on your DVD and see that there are over 60 minutes left!"
24276,-1,not closed captioned,"I am a deaf person and I count on the Closed Captioning and subtitles to be able to enjoy a movie.Even though Blow is listed as being Closed Captioned, this copy is not.A waste of my time and money."
24278,-1,Yes it does BLOW!,"This movie is the worst of it's type to date. More a series of classic rock music videos strung together than anything else, It never pulls you into the world it is trying to create. Donnie Brasco, Goodfellas, even Godfather III. Make this a film I think Johnny Depp should probably try and buy all copies and burn. Get the soundtrack instead. Long and boring non-involving, bad acting and bad wigs make this truly unwatchable."
24288,-1,wrong book,"They sent me the wrong book. It was The Berenstain Bears, Learn About Strangers, instead of The Stranger. It was disappointing!!"
24295,-1,This is a book for losers!!,"I hate this book, though I understand why this book became so popular. We, humans, are not logical machines. I think anyone who have read any of Nietzsche's books would think this book childish and absurd."
24299,-1,Confusing and Depresing,I had to read this book for a test I am having in Honors English tomorrow. The book made no sense and was all out depressing. I don't know why anybody would want to read it let alone deem it as a classic.
24300,-1,Just Terrible,"I'm sure that I'm missising something here. Or maybe all of the people who wrote their glowing reviews of this book are missing something, but this was one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing style was like a Junior High School student trying to write their first story. Really more than just a list of sequential events like, I woke up, I went to work, I went to bed. I found after a few pages that I didn't really care what happened to the main character any more than he seemed to care what happened to himself. The only saving grace was that it was such a short book that I was able to read it in about two hours. I know that Camus is well respected and was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature, but based on this book I can't understand or imagine why."
24301,-1,SO overrated,"This is a top contender for the worst book ever written. I thought about giving it a tied position with Pamela Anderson's _Star_, but upon reflection I have decided that I would rather read _Star_ again than read _The Stranger_ again, although I would rather be eaten alive by rabid wolverines than do either. This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it. If I had a time machine, I would pay to have Camus beaten to death on a deserted beach, ultimately preventing this disaster from ever coming into existence."
24310,-1,Pure junk...worth no stars,"Like any bottom-sucker, Yoko continues to feed off the legacy of a deeply troubled, yet brilliant, man. If you have a warm spot in your heart for John Lennon, do not buy this book."
24315,-1,poor quality set,I was very disappointed with the set. It looked like low quality items were selected for the set. The dice looked cheap and were dislodged from the fitting when I opened it. I was unable to fit them back altogether in their slot. It was as if the dice went to another set. I will be looking for a nicer set now.
24317,-1,I just don't know about this one...,"My mom passed this book on to me with the words, ""it's a quick read."" And I will give her proper credit, it was a quick read. Unfortunately, the plot is far from subversive and the characters are two dimensional at best. The plot while slightly outlandish (woman loses husband and miscarries, then meets a man that is also dying) could technically happen, but I was not emotionally invested in any of these characters. And sadly, I think that is what this book is missing, characters that the reader knows or indentifies with or some sort of level. When I read, I like to think well I know someone like that or I can picture that character. I didn't do that at all in this book. Patterson seldom gets behind typecasted characters to actually create anyone real. I am honestly not sure what could have saved this book, more exposition or details maybe...not a total write off...but nothing spectacular."
24319,-1,Disgusted,"This book glorifies adultery. Between a married woman and her pastor, no less. She didn't love her husband? Why not divorce him? Why marry him in the first place? Why cheat on him? And, try to justify it to her granddaughter?"
24321,-1,Not Worth Your Time,"I collect books that feature Wisconsin or are written by a Wisconsin author.This book uses Lake Geneva, Wisconsin as the setting. Nearly every reference to the town and even the way Patterson categories it is wrong.If you don't know the town make up a fictional one rather than try to capitalize on a town's cachet. In the least have someone fact-check the work."
24323,-1,"Disappoionting, Cliche, Predictable, and Poor Materials","I'm quite a fan of Patterson's books. To read this kind of poor plot crap was a waste of time! The story was nice if putting in one or two sentenses, but to make a book it ought to have a better research and twists than this! The worst of his books I've read by far!This is a complete junk, lame story. Mind as well read a gossip column from National Enquirer!!!!!!!!!!!"
24324,-1,Awful read!,"You really need to read this kind of trash books once in a while to be able to fully appreciate good books. I picked it up from Borders because they had it on a huge sale. I should have known why nobody would buy it at normal price.A grandma (soon to be great grandma) confessing about an unconvincing extra marital affair to her grand daughter while the grand daughter herself is finding a new love in her life, in a not-so convincing manner! How sick can this get?It is almost like the author just followed a predictable plot line."
24339,-1,Read the SMALL print!,"Everyone is correct, the movie is a great movie. The problem is in the Amazon descriptions, or lack thereof. This movie has been EDITED! I can't understand why, it was a good wholesome movie in the first place. Amazon should make this information more prominent. We watched the movie and that was how we found out it was edited....what a waste of money. I won't buy anymore movies from Amazon."
24342,-1,No sure if satisfied yet,Wrote to ask if movie was in italian or english...opened to see after no reply..will not play in our DVD so going to try a brand new one my daughter has. If works and is in English we will keep it. If it in Italian or it does not work in their dvd we will be sending it back.Stewart Schofield
24347,-1,Was Not Happy!!!,"It turned out to be a Region 2 DVD and would not play on my Blu-ray Player. I had looked at so many before I bought it I must have not looked, or it wasn't posted."
24351,-1,Just for the Seller...,"I bought this ""new"" on amazon and when it was delivered I could tell it had been repackaged. Not only that but the plastic circle the holds the dvd into the case was broken for BOTH cds, and the dvd had scratches all over it. I wouldn't even consider this ""like new""Of course, the movie is still a wonderful classic."
24355,-1,Ooops - who let Goofy in the copy-room?,"Pinocchio is one of my favorite movies and my children love it as well. What a gift it was to get it on DVD! But upon putting it in the player today, found out that the Prince of Egypt was actually on it. The cover and holder showed Pinocchio. This was a very sad mistake by Buena Vista Home Entertainment."
24366,-1,Enough with the Musketeers,"It's not so much the fact that there have been far too many Musketeer films, as the fact that this movie stinks!!!The acting is totally atrocious!!! SOme of the worst acting I've seen on film. Mena Suvari was so good in American Beauty, but in this dud she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.Whoever that guy is playing D'artanan...he looked a bit like Chris O'Donnell, who did play this character in the three musketeers, he needs to take some acting classes or find a new career. What a bore!While this fellow was nice to look at, he was such a bad actor! He needs to just stick to something easy, like male modeling.This is just another attempt at a swashbuckler film, and it failed miserably. Reminds me of some made for t.v. movie that might show up on the WB network.Watch the Musketeer film with Chris O'Donnell and Kiefer Sutherland. It's a much better made film."
24376,-1,Quite possible the worst movie of all times. 0 stars,"This movie [stinks]. The story is nothing like the original, the acting is horrific, the swordfighting utterly ridiculous.The scene that sums it all up is when the guards won't chase after a carriage going about 1 mph and everyone escapes.I have no idea how on earth anyone could make a movie so terrible. Extremely torturous to watch. Do not buy it, do not rent it. In fact, just read the book, which is awesome."
24382,-1,Very Bad Movie,"This is really one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. It does an injustice to the Pulitizer Prize winning novel titled ""The Mambo Kings Play Songs Of Love"" which the movie is based on.If you must see this movie, check it out at a local library, or rent it, but don't spend the money to own this video. You're much better off reading the novel."
24391,-1,An insult to volleyball and cheaply made.,"This dvd is a complete joke,and I believe my single purchase paid for the entire production. I am ashamed that I purchased it.

It is so pathetic that I cannot even hand it down to the 12 year-old level coaches. Pay for shipping and you can have my copy!"

Little did I realize that the radioactivity would be so low that I can barely run the car and not be able to launch the counter-traffic missiles or the retroguns designed to take down chasing cops.I dont want to get started on the time machine. It malfunctioned just when I had set the year to 2064 (just to see if my girl would be with me till that time). A serious of beeps with warnings of insufficient power and the whole damn machine went up in smokes killing my children and maiming my grandma.

24406,-1,Looks too much like Skinny & Sweet,"I think this product should be recalled, specifically because it's packaging looks too much like Skinny & Sweet.

24424,-1,"Interesting Idea, Terrible Movie","As a romantic comedy addict, I expected a lot from this movie. The original idea was very interesting and could have made an excellent comedy about women and emotions. MISTAKE! this is one of the worst film i ever seen in my whole life and without a doubt the most predictable and boring piece of garbage. The acting is terrible: Mel Gibson is Over-The-Top and horrendous.You can't believe him one second. I was ashamed for him. Then, we got Helen Hunt (the worst actress in history): To say that this girl can't act is an understatement. She made me sick. One-dimensional and absolutly horrible performance. The only good points are the solid performance from Marisa Tomei and the enjoyable Bette midler guest appearence but they just can't save the film. Avoid this movie at all cost: It's just too BAD. A waste of time, efforts and movie reels. 2 hours of my life i'll never get back. If you enjoy romantic comedies, check out ""Chocolat"" or ""You've Got Mail""."
24428,-1,A total flop,"I'm sorry but I think Mel Gibson is much too old for the character of this role. I thought the story line relied too much on crude humour, obviously Hollywood doesn't think that people can enjoy a movie without a little naughty stuff in their movies.Well their wrong, I didn't enjoy this movie because of the objectionable and disgusting crude humour,etc.. I thought that it was silly, and shallow, and definately this is not Mel Gibson's best. He's much too old for this part.I don't know what Hollywood wants women to think they want, but I know that I was sorry to have wasted my time watching it. His character is manipulative, and disgusting. I don't understand how the director, could glamourize this. It has too many offensive things for me to like it.I think that the romance storyline was ridiculous and silly."
24430,-1,"Great premise, bad movie","What a great premise. Mel Gibson, a male chauvanist of the worst order, can hear what women think. The previews looked like the movie was going to be a great comedy. If you're looking for comedy, though, just watch the previews. All of the funny parts are in the previews, and the movie turns into a romantic drama about Mel Gibson's character reforming and seeking better relationships with his daughter and boss. This had all the makings of a truly fun comedy, and there are great actors in this movie, but it just doesn't satisfy. Perhaps if I had known going in that this movie was a drama, I would have appreciated it more, but this is a movie in search of a theme. Also, Mel Gibson's character is hard to like as he first is a chauvanist, then uses his gift to manipulate people, then finally reforms. By the time he's turned things around, it's too late to turn this movie around. Definately one that I would skip."
24432,-1,Useless,"If you want to learn the form of this style, look else ware. Instructions on the form are very poor.

I don't care about that fact either because nothing could convince me to put up with this boring old movie again. I had the misfortune of seeing this some time ago, and even more misfortune of seeing the stage show. Boring. I'd rather pull my eyelashes out one by one or something equally as torturous.

This movie could only be enjoyed by a pack of prepublescent girls at a slumber party who are wondering what its like to lose their virginity. And am I the only one who thinks that Jennifer Gray is a total dog? Sure she's got a hot body but that face! UGGG! That is the one thing that kept this movie from scorring with the guys in my opinion. Skip it, rent roadhouse instead. Better plot, better chicks!"

Horrific, outdated material.","Hemmingway may be a classic - but that doesn't mean this book has any place in literary history.How can an intelligent person defend a blood sport between man and animal that is unfair from the get-go? In bullfighting, the bull, whether he wins the fight or not, will always be sent to a gruesome death. It is a hideous, cruel sport that every Spaniard and supporter, should be ashamed of. Why it has not been outlawed, is a disgrace.Burn this book!"
24510,-1,Nothing Like DragonHeart,I was so looking forward to this movie. What a disappointment. It was NOTHING like the first movie. I guess a good (great)act is hard to follow. If your looking for a good fantasy movie I recommend the origional Dragonheart or Excalubur. If your thinking about purchasing this movie PLEASE rent it first to see if you like it.
24511,-1,Draco would not approve of this.,"I am not someone who hates sequals. I absolutly hate the first Dragonheart it is a masterpiece. Great effects, great story, sad ending. It is a five star movie all the way. This is horible. First of all the effects are awful. Many dragon films form the 1960s looked better. Drake looks like a cartoon. The plot is worse then the effects. It involves finding a dragon egg. Where did he come from. The first said draco was the last one. Now this movie said he wasn't. THIS RUINS THE FIRST MOVIE. The acting stinks. I can't believe anyone over the age of 5 would like this... Watch the first Dragonheart."
24525,-1,Boring,"Clearly, you have to be a fan of the robot genre to remotely even come close to liking this book. The first chapter gets off to a very slow start, the storyline becomes boring rapidly, and after a while, the book is unreadable. I would imagine that those disappointed with this highly overrated book would turn to other science fiction. Lord of the Rings puts this book to shame. J.R.R. Tolkien makes this author look unimaginative to say the least. If you want real science fiction, start with The Hobbit and go onto the LORD OF THE RINGS. Put this book where it belongs: in the GARBAGE bin."
24526,-1,Ghastly,"A hatful of people with unreadable alien names, and a central character called Paul. Vastly advanced civilisations who retain a totally monarchic society. Never have so many dreadful Science Fiction cliches been brought together in one book. Ghastly."
24527,-1,Kindle version,"I have climbed out of bed to write this for you, because I can take it no longer. Whoever made the kindle version should be fired. The book itself is great. However, random missing spaces, extra spaces, italics that begin or end when they shouldn't, mis-spellings of stillsuit as ""stulsuit""....Please, buy another version. This is an embarrassment to e-publishing....and you'd think with it being on the computer it'd be easier to check for errors. Guess not.Look elsewhere for your ebook copy of Dune."
24528,-1,This may be the biggest disappointment for a sequal... ever!,"Dune has about seven interweaving plot layers. This book has maybe one, which is life and death. At just 278 pages this book is by far the shortest book in the six book series. If you've loved Dune, you'll probably hate the sequal so don't read it."
24529,-1,Dune,I own the Kindle Fire. Why should I have to pay more for an e-book then one thats actually printed and shipped and stored? Thats crazy.
24531,-1,Ridiculous Price,"$15 for a poorly formatted, un-proofread eBook version of a book that is more than 40 years old is a travesty. Love my Kindle, love the book, but stuff like this makes me seriously question the long term chances for eBooks; you can pick up a gently used version of this book for <$1 from various places for crying out loud."
24534,-1,okay,"Hype aside, it's a good, albeit not spectacular story. I was actually a little put off by the grammar and boring parts. I did have to force myself to accept ""spice"" et al. Is it anti-semitic? It could be interpreted as such, but I'm not sure. It's worth a look, but don't buy into the hype. And I hope the don't make another movie. Uhhh..."
24535,-1,twaddle-dee-twaddle-dum,"Prose that would make a Dungeons and Dragon novel blush, boring , narcassistic characters, plot goes nowhere...1 star"
24540,-1,An over-rated piece of fiction,"I had several close friends recommend Dune to me, all proclaiming how amazing it was as a novel, only to hear later that not one of them finished it for the same reason: ""it was kinda boring."" If you're asking yourself why someone would praise and recommend a book that they find to be boring then you're just as mystified as I am. I have yet to meet anyone who has read Dune who liked it or ever finished it.The books major problem is it has too many minor characters and very poor character development. The lead character, Paul, is a good example, as he has no personality, or any interesting qualities whatsoever. Sadly, all the characters are this way.I did finish this book, after forcing myself to keep reading for six months, and I will say that it eventually does get more interesting, but only in the last two chapters."
24541,-1,3/4 of it is missing!,This video description says 4 episodes of Morocco and Russia but it only shows 1 episode of Morocco! 1 episode of Morocco is missing and there is nothing at all on Russia! :(
24543,-1,Battery and screen suck,"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, because I wanted a simple phone that is light, tri-band, and with a decent battery (up to 2 weeks standby time nowadays is quite reasonable).The battery in standby didn't last more than 3 days, and if you turn off the phone to recharge the battery, the screen becomes totally dark: it is then impossible to know whether the phone is recharging, or whether it became fully charged, which I've never seen with the other Nokia phones!If these characterstics are generic, then get rid of it A.S.A.P.!!!!"
24544,-1,Absolutely terrible!,"I have read Jane Austen over and over for years, and really enjoyed the ""modern"" movies Sense & Sensibility, Emma, and Pride and Prejudice (with Keira Knightley, although I think they treated it more like a dramatization of a Charlotte Bronte novel than Jane Austen). I was really looking forward to this movie, but when I was finished watching, I felt incredibly disappointed. Tom Lefroy was portrayed as a jerk, who seemed to have no real appreciation of Jane as a person, but just saw her as a woman to conquer. Jane was an idiot and I never could figure out what she was supposed to see in the guy. The sexual innuendos were thoroughly 2007, and stuck out like a sore thumb. I tried the movie again a second time, and couldn't get through it. Next time I'll stick to my previous rule - rent before you buy! A total waste."
24554,-1,Hated It!!!,"I loved the television series, so I thought I'd check out the book.Huge Mistake!!This novel went absolutely no where. I hated it!Come to think of it, the book doesnt even deserve the time its taken me to reveiw it."
24555,-1,a sorry bit of commercialism,"I should have known better after the ""Rose Red"" trash. This is a cheap ploy to sucker you in to watching the series. Not only that , I've noticed Stephen King's current writing is concerned more with his pet peeves, political leanings, and predjudices than with telling a good story. Maybe it is time for King to retire."
24562,-1,Happy Anniversary Americans!,"It was just a little over 13 months ago that Americans flushed this john and voted for leadership. We didn't buy into the lies or false claims of heroism perpetrated by Kerry and writers like Brinkley who rely on their subject for facts (fat chance)The economy is moving well. Iraq is moving well regardless what Kerry says. This Kerry promotional piece did not work and thank God for that.HAPPY ANNIVERSARY AMERICANS! WE ALL ""FLUSHED THE JOHNS IN 2004!"""
24564,-1,Not True,"The truth has finally come out. The Swift Boat Veterans finally got it in the open.John Kerry is a liar, nothing more, nothing less"
24566,-1,This book is bull!,"I never got past the chapters of Kerry's experiences on the USS GRIDLEY. Since I served with him the entire year, I can assure readers that it is filled with exaggeration and fantasy. Kerry makes himself out to be Master and Commander when he was just a goofy boot Ensign. There are a number of things that are just plain not true and lots of exaggeration. It is not a serious work but clearly a piece of campaign fluff.Don't waste your money unless you are Democratic to the core and need some fluff to get you excited!"
24570,-1,Total Puff Piece,"If you believe the picture painted in this book about Kerry, I have a bridge for sale. This is a complete puff piece that no self respecting ""Historian"" would publish. Read ""Unfit for Command"" to get the truth!"
24571,-1,Kerry's Tour Of Duty For North Vietnam,"The book has no information on Kerry's ""tour of duty"" with Hanoi Jane and her gang.Nothing on how North Vietnam's leader dredit Kerry & Fonda for saving North Vietnam from defeat. Nothing on how Kerry's family financial benefitted from the normalization of relations with his old comrades in the ""new"" Vietnam."
24577,-1,"A Manufactured, Not Earned, Record","John Kerry gamed the awards and decs system--I saw it happen during my 12-month (not 4-month) tour of duty in Viet Nam. His book is nothing more than a compilation of fabrications to bolster his image for the 2004 election. John Kerry is a hero? Not! I believe the 250 men of the Swift Boats Veterans for Truth, not Kerry and his bought-off handful."
24579,-1,Shame on Amazon.com's Political Bias,"The following disclaimer appears on the ""Unfit for Command"" Swift boat book:""Important note from Amazon.com: We've decided to suspend our normal customer review policies and rules for this title. For example, we usually prohibit ad hominem attacks. That policy in particular seems to be incompatible with presidential election year politics. Therefore, short of obscenities, reviews on this book are now a free-for-all. We take no responsibility for the following discussion. Aren't presidential election years great? Have fun!""Why is there no such disclaimer issued for this book? It seems that Amazon's political bias is showing! Shame! Shame! Shame!Until this same disclamer appears under ""Tour of Duty"" I will take my book buying business elsewhere!"
24584,-1,Beware!!!,Beware of all of the positive reviews! They are marketing plants! Notice that all of the 5 star reviewers only review shirts for this and another company.
24588,-1,Robot Wars a must not see,"This movie is not very well written in my opinion and is probably a good thing that it is priced so high. Most of it is uninportant dailog that seems to have little or no piont with no story or structure. There is alittle action at the end, but of poor qualaty. To make a long review short, it is basically like a bad episode of G.I Jeo."
24593,-1,"High expectations, MAJOR let down","well I really expected this to be a funny movie, given the reviews as well as the stellar cast. But, aside from a couple of SMALL laughs and the surprise ending, this movie is a DUD. The jokes and the plot both fall flat. Ugh I wish I hadn't wasted my time on this one. Major disappointment!!!"
24601,-1,Bizarre and braindead,"THis movie is one of the dumbest that I have seen in a long time. It is completely lacking in sense or logic. THe beginning was cool becase of Rammstein, but it went downhill from there. Its fine for a movie to have attitude, but this was just too over the top. And the acting was pretty bad, too. No doubt that it is a showy film, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like dumb action movies."
24614,-1,Awful,"Vin Diesel was awful in this movie. He couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. the fast and furious was over the top and entertaining. Diesel was good in that flick. XXX was a lot of pointless action, no character or story development and unbelieve stunts. a lot of things happened with no real reasoning to why. Stay away. do not waste 2 hours on this one."
24617,-1,Triple Bad!!!,"This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Vin Diesel is the worst actor. For ANYBODY to call him the ""new James Bond"" is sad and laughable. Say what you want about Roger Moore's performances as James Bond, Vin Diesel could NEVER compare to him and he was the worst James bond ever!! The stunts in this movie are awesome, but the acting and plot is HORRIBLE!! I felt ashamed that I watched this movie because it insulted my intelligence. This movie was SO bad and to think it was a block buster hit!!! Vin is sexy (although he sometimes force it), but nothing and I do mean NOTHING should excuse him for making this mess. C'mon Vin, do better next time!!"
24620,-1,AWWWWWWFULLLLLLLL,"THIS MOVIE WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT, VERY UNREAL, JAMES BOND MOVIES ARE WAY BETTER"
24623,-1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"Well i saw this movie on the night of its release... Just like most women in this world I am a HUGE VIN DIESEL fan... I saw him in the Fast and the Furious, Pitch Black, Boiler Room,and so on. I was SADLY DISSAPOINTED by this movie. It was long and dry. The funny parts were few and far between, and there was sooo much action in it that it was almost UNBEARABLE to watch. Between the mediocre acting and the tired fighting scenes. It leaves u drained. NOT VIN DIESELS FINEST HOUR I WILL SAY.."
24624,-1,Stunts cool? (Someone DIED for your amusement)!,"For those of you ""ranting"" about how cool the stunts were in this piece of ... movie you should know the truth; one of the stunt doubles for Vin Diesel was killed in the paragliding scene. His name was Harry O'Connor. Knowing this fact will probably make you ... think this movie is even more cool."
24631,-1,One of the Worst Gay Movies Ever Made,"I cannot believe that so many people actually liked this movie. I have seen over 60 gay and lesbian movies and this is by far the worst one that I have ever had the misfortune to watch-with ""Chuck and Buck"" running a close second."
24639,-1,Don't Read THE BEATLES ROCK's Review...This is Pure Garbage!!,"Well, i'm gonna say my prayers to THE BEATLES ROCK. What is your problem? The bands you hate are legends, and the bands you like are really really awful and joke. If you can't talent my legends, then what the hell are you doing on the internet???Huh why?Anyway, The Rolling Stones are stupid! They only made 2 decent songs in Start Me Up, and Shattered. Rest of their albums and songsjust stink, including their newest one. Avoid this and get a Foreigner or Metallica CD insted.PS.Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and The Beatles are garbage so avoid allalbums from those bands."
24640,-1,Here they go again .,"If you have heard any Rolling Stones album that hey have put out in the past 30 years,you have heard this.When oh when are they going to give up the ghost? If you have to buy a Stones album,go with something pre 1973."
24643,-1,Not very good...,"I consider myself a pretty big Stones fan. They've always been in my life, and I own each record, and can appreciate them all. I actually think Bridges to Babylon is one of their finest record (I don't dislike a single song on it) but A Bigger Bang is just not very good. Stuff like ""Streets of Love"" is just awful easy listening, and ""Sweet Neocon"" is just the Stones trying too hard to create controversy during the Bush Years. I did like ""Rough Justice"" for about ten seconds then realized, again, they were trying way too hard to ""rock"".I think the Stones will eventually admit that this record stinks.Thank God for the second side of the Exile on Main St. reissue. It more than makes up for A Bigger Bang being the Stones final studio output."
24659,-1,Big Disappointment,"Anyone who saw the stage production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR RAINCOAT must be disappointed by the movie. The main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school, resulting in unrealistic and cutesy scenes of kids worshipfully smiling at singing adults. The music is good, but the narrator makes faces, and Danny Osmond with long hair and half-shaven looks like he just woke up from sleeping on the street. My advice if you have this video is to close your eyes, and just listen to the music."
24660,-1,tastless movie,"I have heard great things about Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. This was just not my cup of tea. I thought the singing and the characters were horrible. Some of the clothing was very suggestable in my opionion. I would not recommend this video at all. Though others who gave it a bad review, said they had seen better ones done live. So i am going to try to keep an open mind and try to go to a live one in a theater near by, where maybe I will be able to see what everyone is talking about. The whole movie just left me bored and wasn't a movie that inspired my and my faith. It was cheesy to say the least."
24666,-1,Short but boring.,"AS an admirer of the great JC Superstar and Cats, I expected much. But, this was really disappointing. What's the point? What's the narrator for? Songs are weak (no memorable song). Nothing special in story. No enjoyable dance. Strange mood of adult (costumes! and even the narrator herself). And school boys and girls...for what? I really enjoyed JCS and Cats movie but I cannot recommend this(Joseph) at all. Boring and nothing enjoyable."
24676,-1,Do not buy,I bought this for my dog and he did not stop chewing instead he dranked it like it was water this product does not work at all
24679,-1,My GOD,"Literally the worst picture quality i have ever seen on a DVD. Not only did it detract from the movie experience, I was not scared in the least because i was too angry at the horrible picture. Don't get me wrong, it is one of my favorite movies of all time, but this DVD is absolutely and utterly a waste of money. Wait for the real special edition that I hope is coming. I cant believe those first two reviews. Obviously product placement by the publishing company. DONT BUY THIS!!!!"
24680,-1,THE FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER MADE!,"YOU MAY ASK WHY I THINK THIS MOVIE IS THE FUNNIEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. WELL YOU SEE, THE MOVIE'S PLOT, ACTOR'S, AND SETTING IS SO INCREDIBLY STUPID THAT IT IS LAUGHABLE. MY FRIENDAND I RENTED THIS MOVIE AND EXPECTED IT TO BE SCARY. INSTEAD WE WERE ROLLING ON THE FLOOR WITH RED FACES AND TEARS COMING DOWN OUR EYES BECAUSE OF HOW STUPID, BUT HILLARIOUS THIS MOVIE IS. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HORROR MOVIE, SORRY IT'S NOT HERE. BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT COMEDY, THIS IS THE MOVIE!"
24681,-1,The scariest film ever? No way,"TCM (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is in a word, awful. There is virtually NO plot whatsoever. The whole film centers on about 5 teenagers who, due to their immense stupidity, fall victim to the demented Texas Chainsaw Man. It's a lousy movie, with lousier acting. Some call this the scariest film ever made? Ha! You could sleep through this nonsense! Do yourself - the valued customer - a favor and give TCM a skip ..."
24698,-1,the most over rated movie ever,"I thought that being a film , which hasn't been released on video / DVD format for so long . And the fact the it was said to be one of the most shocking and brutal to be released on video . What a load of rubbish !!"
24703,-1,Terrible,I ordered Mean Streets based on a review I seen on a special on gangster and mafia movies. It is terrible. I do not recommend it to anyone.
24704,-1,Hilarious when drunk,"This had to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Just because it had big names, didn't make it good. I do have to say however that when hammered, this film is one of the funniest I have ever seen. I mean, it takes a pair to check your pants at a coat check. I only recommend this film to the heavily innebriated."
24705,-1,Horrible film!,"My only reason for seeing this film is because Robert DeNiro is in it. Good 1960's music and good Italian music, but good music doesn't always make a film good. This is a horrible film. Waste of my time."
24709,-1,A real joke to the ANOES series,This was a movie turned into a movie that has to be a real joke to the series. This was a movie where the original stars of the first movie have trouble with Freddy and then Freddy comes to the real world and then kills people. The weird part of this movie was how director Wes Craven made the movie like a documentary of Freddy's life instead of a sequel. The special effects weren't too good nor bad either but you could see why the special effects were mediocre because of the low budget. Freddy would star in his next movie Freddy Vs Jason that was a lot better than this.
24727,-1,i wouldnt even give this one star,"HO-kuwho names their album another dumb blond? why would you call yourself a dumb blond, especially on the front of your CD. Stupid unintellectual music"
24728,-1,Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!,"this ""music"" is stuff that can give a little boy nightmares. believe me its happened to simlings i'd give names but they choose to stay anonymous. I think sewer rats wrote her only unbelivelby scary song,(maybe racoons). some talent with that one song that she did'nt even write! god when will these non talented teenboppers stop coming. i sugest superman for this problem"
24730,-1,The Preservationist,"Item arrived in excellent condition....the ""book"" however was a great disappointment. I only was able to listen to a very little of the first disc because of language and content. I was expecting something totally different than this. Very disappointed in it!"
24737,-1,are you that stupid ?,Really? The other reviewers bought this piece of &*%$ ? Can you say shills. Rather than buy this why not take your money and flush it down the toilet as a way of communicating with the little green men?
24741,-1,THEY DONT COME MORE PRETENTIOUS,I checked this CD out because the awesome Amy Madden played and sang backup (hey I hope the money was worth it!) and I found out on the net that she was on this. This guy has to be kidding! ME ME ME ME like who cares about this Tom Petty copycat with the annoying voice. PREEE TEN SHUS!! Dont quit your day job. And hey! when am I going to get the next AM CD its been too long.
24742,-1,Buyers remorse that inspires anger...,"I can't believe I bought the back cover hype, and purchased this book. Mr. Roberto should have begun most sentences with, ""Uh..."". Lacking confidence, he speculates on the shallow, obvious sides of Neal's brilliant lyrics. I can only surmise that a Writers Club Press saw dollar signs, conspired with a bogus editer, and convinced Mr. Roberto that his internet thoughts would make a good book. But, c'mon Len, this book is in your name, and your reputation. How could you have not fleshed out this manuscript to make it readable? Skip this book, and read Mystic Rythums."
24746,-1,TATU,"This is the worst CD I have ever listened to. First fo all, the translation is just awful. I kind of liked their music when it was in russian (At least it made sense)."
24748,-1,Quick! Bring me a bag to barf in!,"If they really want so much attention why don't they just go jump off a cliff? Britney Spears already did the school-girl act, but now, making out? Who wants to watch two lesbian girls make out in the rain? Everytime I see the video I want a bag to barf in! Now, I'm not saying anything bad about lesbians, but, this is too much! The first time I saw them on MTV I thought, ""Oh look, new singers"". Then --- I saw the video. I went online to read about the interview with MTV and they said ""We aren't lesbians we just love eachother"". Ok, alright....so why are they making out?! DON'T BUY THIS CD OR ANY OTHER ONES BY T.A.T.U.!"
24751,-1,Half an album X 2,I bought this album and half the songs are in english and the same songs in russian. It's like buying half an album and playing it twice and paying 2 times the price. It's a rip off.
24752,-1,Just terrible!,"The lyrics speak for themselves. All these girls do is scream the same line over and over and OVER again until it is relentlessly ANNOYING.Here are some of the lyrics to ""Not Gonna Get Us."" The lyrics alone prove a valid point to NOT buying this terrible CD.Not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usNot gonna get usNot gonna get usThey're not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usNot gonna get usThey're not gonna get usNot gonna get usNothing can stop this, not now I love youThey're not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usNothing can stop this, not now I love youThey're not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usNot gonna get usNot gonna get usNot gonna get usNot gonna get usGet usNot gonna get us"
24757,-1,Dreadful,"The one word that sums this movie up is dreadful. I love the story, but the little Nazi-style elves sprouting leaves are just one example of how this interpretation went wrong. With only one exception (The Return of the King, also by Rankin -Bass) it is it is the worst adaptation of Tolkien's works that I have ever seen."
24758,-1,dont buy,horribel its a copy of the origanal and it is so dark that you can hardly see ant thing that is going on
24770,-1,awful,"this is painful to look at-avoid it like the plague-it has not much to do with the Book of the same title,except in some plot details"
24778,-1,Movies on Parade Version.,I can't speak for the other version that Amazon is going to group this review in with but don't buy the one with the Orange banner on the top that reads Movies on Parade. The video transfer to DVD is terrible. The pictures varies widely from too dark to see anything to washed out bright. The sound is just as bad. It looks like someone put a videophone on a tripod. Watched a decent recorded a decent version of the movie and then made a DVD of the recording from their phone. It is pretty much unwatchable.
24781,-1,Bad copy,"This movie is good, but this is a review of the copy. This copy of the Hobbit is SO POOR.It looks like a rip from a dying VHS copy. It looks SO BAD. You can't even see what's going on during the dark scenes, and I KNOW it wasn't that crappy originally. I've seen the movie before, and it is not meant to look this bad. It looks like a bootleg or something, THAT BAD.I really regret not reading the reviews before ordering this..."
24786,-1,not viewable,"The dvd I got is too dark and can't be seen any of my televisions, all new flatscreens. Even with the brightness turned all the way up and at night I can't see it. Obviously a waste of money since there is nothing I can do with it now."
24789,-1,Worst Production value I have ever seen,Avoid this edition. Audio doesn't match video all the time and fade outs for 10 second about every 20 minutes. Entire film is to dark to see most of the time. Old VHS version of this movie has much high quality video.
24793,-1,Lol the Bible sucks,"Responsible for hate, bigotry, and false beliefs for thousands of years. It is literally nothing more than a giant fantasy book for adults. If you believe in fairy tales and santa, you'll believe this too."
24801,-1,Worked for two weeks,Handset is bulky and not comfortable to use. Speaker in handset sounded terrible while it worked. After two weeks the radio no longer produces any sound. Everything lights up like it thinks it's working but there is no sound at all.I hope I can just return this item for a refund
24802,-1,Power from vehicle battery,"I was looking forward to using this product. When I received the CB Radio I find that it does not plug into the cigarette lighter as I thought, it connects directly to the vehicle battery. Can't do that so it is going back. I give Amazon one star for not making this clear."
24808,-1,Nice cinematography . . . nothing else,"Some nice cinematography is wasted by an inane script full of historical inaccuracies, cliches, and stereotypes. The romance begins to succeed in the first 1/3 of the film, but the attempt to add suspense, tragedy, and mystery all fail miserably, and the actors appear to know it. I wouldn't waste a rental fee to see this tripe again."
24809,-1,Save Yourself,"I saw this and I must say I felt I was trapped in a sophomoric misunderstanding of Ingmar Bergman. If you want beautiful cinematographic postcards of the Pacific Northwest, by all means. If you want a lifeless P.C. apology to Japanese-Americans, by all means. If you want a movie that you can stay awake through . . . run, run, run to your nearest made-for-televison movie . . .you'll thank me."
24813,-1,Not What You Think,It's little more like for throwing on the back of your seat to sit on rather then to curl up in. It barley works. It takes forever for it to heat up. I'm not really happy about this because I could have got a bigger one for cheaper at my local store and a better quality.
24814,-1,Would not recommend the wide angle lens,"I have a Canon G9 and I would not recommend the wide angle lens in this kit since the corners of the photos are cropped. The cropping can be eliminated by zooming in, but to the point that the viewport is the about the same as the stock lens, thereby making the wide angle lens useless. I've found other reviews (after my purchase) claiming that the Canon wide angle lens does not have this problem.I called 47th Street Photo to send this back and they are going to charge a 15% restocking fee for a product that I feel is defective."
24827,-1,I'd rather see the Swanson version,"THis movie was an insulting depiction of the visions of St. Joan of Arc. Looking through the eyes of a twentieth century thinker...the writer and director decided to throw out the idea of Joan and her divine visions and imply the idea that she was mad. The movie takes the Character of a powerful woman who entered a man's world and controled it with grace and strength...and turns her into a childish mad woman who seem to deserve her fate. NO, if you want to learn the Joan of Arc story then read a book. If you want to see a dramatic version of the story...rent the blackand white, or even better rent the Gloria Swanson silent film"
24831,-1,Joan ???....,Got to say the video quality was good for a old movie but however I was quite disappointed with the general story line.... a resonable cast but story line was too week ... nothing much but a crazy women going to war.......sad story not a blue ray worth keeping wont be watching it again ......a pity....
24833,-1,Major FAIL,"I had to stop after 15 min when the gum chewing mediaeval girls started saying ""YO! DUDE! FER SHURE~! DIG IT!being somewhat facetious but thats how it was"
24839,-1,Horrible Movie,"I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in a movie. This was historically inaccurate beyond belief. It almost seemed like it was making Joan out to be the villain. If you want to see a good movie on Joan Of Arc, see the ""Joan Of Arc"" movie that was on TV."
24840,-1,The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc,"Well as a student of History, this movie is to say the least, pittiful. The acting is so bad some of the fighting sequences are laughable. The young women who plays Joan, should go back to acting school, she only seems to have two levels crazy, and crazy screaming. The only good thing about the film were the sets and costumes."
24844,-1,This is a one hit CD.,"Very disappointed in this CD. Only one good song (""This Kiss""). Her voice is weak and doesn't have any range. On some of the songs she sounds like she's not even singing in the right key. For REALLY great singers I'll stay with Wynonna, and Shania. What a difference - to listen to one of them after listing to Faith."
24855,-1,The credits were the funniest part,"It would have been so easy to make this into a funny movie. All they needed was more cute and slapstick mouse humor. They missed every opportunity, until the credits were rolling. Then, in a small video window next to the scrolling text, was every funny scene we'd seen in the previews.Skip this one. Rent Toy Story instead."
24858,-1,Not too good for my tastes,"I am currently using this item for my introductory Emglish Literature I course. For Beowulf, they spelled Wealtheow and Edgetheow wrong. And look at the Canterbury Tales, they only have the modern English text for the general prologue, where is the modern english text for the miller's tale, wife of bath's tale, pardoner's tale, nun priest's tale, and the parson's tale? The text in the Canterbury Tales is a little harder to understand without the Modern English translation. Even through this textbook has 624 pages, as soon as I finish my English Literature I course, I am going to sell the text because there are too many mistakes on it and I might plan to buy the Norton version instead with the money, it looks better anyway and it has higher ratings than this text."
24882,-1,Broken Bottle,"Ordered this set for my grandma, it showed up 3 days before christmas and the main perfume bottle was cracked and had leaked every where.Wouldnt recommend buying from the seller, should have just went to jcpenny in the first place."
24883,-1,Too strong,I love the powder so I ordered the set. The lotion is so strong. After washing my hands a few times you can still smell it. The perfume is way too strong. I do not like it. Still love the powder!!!!
24886,-1,Pay attention to what you are ordering...,"I wasn't able to play this because it was for region 2. I didn't notice this when I ordered it, my fault. Now I'm stuck with a $30 item and can't return it because I opened it."
24889,-1,Bad Chop Job,"""Chiefs"" is a made for TV mini series that runs about 4-1/2 hours without commercials. I was hoping to replace my damaged VHS tape copy with a DVD copy. I was greatly disappointed in this copy as it is badly butchered. Not only was it cut down with many segments chopped or eliminated, the editing was a horrible job. It's as though a 5 year old with scissors was turned loose. There are cuts in the middle of scenes, one even in the middle of a conversation. Portions were removed such that some of the subsequent story made no sense, or did not portray the same message as would have come across if the film had been left in its original length.PS if anyone knows of a full length copy out there I'd love to hear about it."
24892,-1,Horrible,The case was broken when it came. It was obviously copied off something like youtube or a bad quality vas tape. Parts had been edited out and it was not what I have come to expect from Amazon. I had no idea that it wasn't a legitimate product.
24896,-1,Need something to light a fire? Here you go...,"I gave this one star, because negative stars are not allowed. The previous review has to have been written by someone closely related to the book.I was a teen-ager during the '80s Ninja Craze and even then, this book would have been seen as a complete joke. I think I was expecting a Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon to turn up somewhere in the book, but was disappointed to not see one.Bottom-line - Stay away from this book. If you are really interested in something about ninja, look into Stephen K. Hayes."
24907,-1,OMFG THIS IS SO GOOOOD!!!!11!!!!!!1ONE!1! LOLZZZZZZ,"mmm you know when a band is singing about d-day and are in their mid twentys, they're only trying to get in the pants of aging WWII veterans, and let me tell ya, i don't think anyone's grandpappy fancys gerard way.good job guyz, sing about WWII because you were there, and who knowz it better than you to mass comercialize an event like d-day than you???this is the reason i doubt humanity."
24909,-1,Doesn't Work Properly.....,Purchased this recently - works fine for my Smart Media card - but can't read or write to my 128MB Memory Stick. Still waiting for a response from Dazzle Support (4 days after submitting query). Will wait a few more days before returning the item.Overall - quite disappointed - had the potential to be a very useful product!
24915,-1,"Broke, will have to be returned","Did not have good luck with this unit; after only a couple of uses on car trips with kids, screen went blank, could not get picture back. Hooked up to TV for a few days, then it started skipping and freezing up. Got as a christmas gift, so now we have to figure out how to return it for a refund. Would not recommend to others."
24917,-1,Please avoid this Unit!,I bought this Portable DVD player at Super Target on sale and when I got it home it played very well and had a nice picture until I tried to watch a complete movie on it. It seemed like it got really hot about halfway through the movie and when I tried to adjust the brightness of the screen it was unresponsive. Then the movie froze and totally locked up so I had to unplug the unit and replug it back in to get it to work.I took it back to Target the next day and got my money back. Target gave me a little hassle about paying a restocking fee but I talked them out of it. If it locks up the first time you use it what's going to happen a year from now? Buyer beware!
24918,-1,waste of money,Audiovox should be ashamed of selling a product this unreliable. I think it worked for the first month and then completely went downhill. One out of twenty DVD's (maybe) will work in it and it's practically brand new. I'm super (mad) at this waste of money!!
24920,-1,this product is a bad investmest,"I bought this dvd player in the beginning of November this year. I got to play about 2 dvds before I startede seeing trouble with it playing movies. Then around the beginning of December, it stopped working. It just loads up and says invalid entry. Now I'm stuck with a broke dvd player and I cant return it because I bought it at a Target across the country."
24937,-1,poor quality,Item is very heavy and does not hold a charge well. illumination begns to dim almost immediately and is never very bright. I would not purchase this item again.
24945,-1,Poorly designed,"This phone is so poorly designed that I returned it after 1 month. The primary issues are ...(1) You always have to press the ""Talk"" button 3 times (not once) in order to get a dial tone.(2) When a voice message is waiting, the phone beeps loudly every 30 seconds. Very annoying when you let the phone take a message because you are preoccupied or have company visiting.(3) If you have the base wallmounted, the handset does not rest securely in the base -- Half the time it falls off when you set it down."
24954,-1,sent wrong speaker,Speaker they sent was a cheap imatation. A real letdown from amazon. They should change the picture.
24956,-1,Only one disc (Disc 2),Beware:People are advertising this product and only delivering beat up copies of Disc 2 only.Caveat Emptor!Buyer Beware.
24962,-1,disapointed,"I was delighted with the early arrival then schedule of this DVD. However I didn't enjoy it at all. I was hoping to here the original songs of Etta James and the acting wasn't that good either, which made for a boring movie."
24964,-1,Not Durable,"My wife used hers no more than 4 times and it burned up. She was not using very heavy at one time. This unit was just not up to standards we set, but for the money, I guess you get what you pay for.Invest in a more expensive unit."
24968,-1,WinXP + WEP == Choose ANY other product than this one.,"First, the drivers packaged with this unit DID NOT WORK. Had to go to belkin.com and download the latest drivers (not the simplest thing to do without a functioning network adapter, eh?). While those drivers sort-of work, they are still extremely flaky. Not signed/certified by microsoft.I use WEP to secure my network... this device does not retain the WEP key/settings after a reboot. So, every single time you reboot, you have to re-enter the WEP key and manually start the driver utility.Signal is very weak - if the signal is lost for too long then the system will eventually hang and reboot itself.I've been a computer professional for the better part of 10 years now and I'm convinced that ANY product would be better than this Belkin POS. Avoid this product at any price."
24974,-1,Don't expect the A1500,"I ordered the A1500 and received the A1000. I opted not to send it back when I read the other feedback on this page. I didn't want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed (as the other fellow did below). Amazon is usually pretty good, not this time, and not on this product.If you want, you can call them at:1.800.201.7575 (Toll free, US and Canada)1.206.346.2992 or 1.206.266.2992 (Outside US and Canada)1.877.586.3230 (Canada only)UK customer service: +44.208.636.9200"
24977,-1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY...,"I bought this sharpener less than a month ago and have two kids who use the sharpener along with me...we don't even use that many pencils and it burned out IN LESS THAN A MONTH. Will be trying a heavy duty electric stapler by Stanley...hopefully it will work out better than this hunk of junk I have now, and I bought it for more than what its selling for on Amazon!"
24980,-1,DVD burned wrong,Two copies had the wrong movie burned on the DVD. Both the box and the label were for the correct movie. Amazon handled replacement and refund easily.
24984,-1,Anyone who read the books will be highly disapointed,"When I heard that there was to be another Anne of Green Gables movie with Megan Follows (!!!) I was very excited. But as soon as I began watching this movie I realized that this story had absolutly nothing to do with the books written by L.M. Montgomery. The beauty, tragedy and humor that is found in the novels is tarnished by the film. For those who haven't read the books, read them, and for those who have I'd recommend watching Anne of Green Gables and the sequel again."
24988,-1,Anne of Green Gables?,"I cannot even find a proper word to fit the description of this disappointing movie. A complete mess from start to finish is probably the best way to review this. I am not a ""all novels made into movies must be exact"" but this was so far from any of the actual novels that I'm sure poor Lucy Maud Montgomery would have cried bitter tears at this portrayal. How sad when the other two were so wonderful. I think the only thing that was the same as the novels is Anne and Gilbert are together. That's about it. What a shame."
24993,-1,How could they do this???,"I was so disappointed to see this movie. I loved the first 2 and was pleasantly surprised to see that a third movie was being made. But, this one had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the true Anne story. I know the first 2 movies had small variations but this was total fiction. I can't believe the took the story of Anne and Gilbert and made it this way. What a sad day for Anne fans when this movie was made..."
24994,-1,Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story,"I was so dissapointed with this i gave it away unlike the first two i wouldnt watch again, it had not one ounce of the magic the first two had! it was a total waste of time making it!"
24997,-1,sizes recomended in the size chart are not real,sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it
25000,-1,"Not an ""ultimate guide""","Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you."
25008,-1,"Slow dull ""classical"" 1980's style movie","2 stars of 5 for this slow dull ""classical"" 1980's style movie. This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead. Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music. To our relief the background music (which is very annoying) is kept to a minimum. Though it attempts to be an action/suspense movie, it achieves neither. I'd suggest skipping this movie."
25022,-1,Will not be purchasing another one of these,"It worked fine in the beginning. 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air. I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed."
25026,-1,Fire Truck Puzzle,"The fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated. It is very colorful and well worth the price. The puzzle is a Christmas gift for a 2 year old, so at this time I can't state how he liked it. But I am very pleased with the quality."
25037,-1,So disappointed,"I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are ""deals"" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron."
25043,-1,This CD iz Aight...........,FIRST OF ALL HOW COME ALL YA'LL BE DISSIN' NO LIMIT (for all ya'll that did not diss em' dis ain't for you) WHAT YA'LL TALKLIN ABOUT CASH MONEY CAN NEVER GET WITH NO LIMIT AND THAT IS A FACT.....

AND I LIKE TO GIVE A SHOT OUT TO MY SOLDIERS.. HOODY HOOO....
25061,-1,Muddled ending disapoints,"The good: The basic plot line is interesting- a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene. The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw."
25063,-1,"Long, somewhat dull and unfocused","This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it kind of is here. First of all it's not funny. It's about ""comedy"" but I wouldn't consider the movie itself to be a comedy, although there are a few funny things in it I suppose. This movie seems like it's all over the place. It has a long runtime but it doesnt really accomplish much. Some people might like the story, but it was pretty dull to me."
25069,-1,Kay Scarpetti is losing it.,"Here is a character I have enjoyed develop. But Kay is losing it. She should dump her niece Lucie, clean up her personal life (it's not nice to have an affair with a friends husband) and treat Det. Marino with some respect.As for Gault, if I pick up another Scarpetti book with his name in it... right back on the shelf"
25080,-1,"Too much kid-pop music for a dark, animated movie!","I don't like the fact that there was so much kiddie-pop music on the soundtrack,where as the first, second, and third movies had a blend of rock, techno, hip-hop, andrap... but this one had too much kid music for a movie that was (for the most part)dark!The only song on this album that fit the mood of the movies was 'Lights Out' by P.O.D.!That re-mix of the song is the only reason why I bought this album!Not recommended for the whole album, just that one song..."
25081,-1,This book is incomprehensible,This book was an anthology of 19 stories. I didn't like it because it was hard for me to make a mental picture in my head. I had to read almost every paragraph over. I could not comprehend at all!
25082,-1,Wasn't what I expected,"I ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big. The item is also like it is made from rubber, but because I needed it for this weekend I don't know what I am going to do at this point."
25083,-1,not really worth it,I wore this for my wedding since I hadn't lost all of my pregnancy weight. It was great for a little bit. But then started getting a crease around my waist. I can't wear it anymore. Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours. They suggest wearing it 8 hours? I couldn't do it. As soon as I take it off I am instantly better.
25085,-1,"Gave me a waist, but just pushed my fat around","The product did what it was ""supposed to"" which was to give me a waist, but it kind of just redistributed my fat. My waist was super tiny, but above and below (mostly below) I bulged like crazy, so I ended up just looking really oddly proportioned. My husband thought that I looked a little like an arthropod, so definitely not the sexy curvy lady that I wanted to be... I guess this product worked for other ladies, but for me, it just looked really unnatural and odd."
25087,-1,Incrediby difficult to put on,With the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give it's really difficult to put on. You need a hand to pull it closed in order to actually be able to close each of the 20 some odd hooks.
25090,-1,Bones,"This product does suck you in Great !! But the bones in here tore back back up, I had all kinds of bruising when I took this off after wearing it all day, they need to make one smooth with out the bones."
25102,-1,Hard to put on,"The shape wear is difficult to put on and you can see the seams through your clothes. It is hard to bend over, especially as a school teacher! I would definitely like to try Brooke Burke's Belly Taut instead of this old school shapewear!"
25128,-1,Not my idea of a good read,I've read worse. But it takes a lot of mental energy to wade through all the commas and figure out the point of each paragraph. It seems a lot longer than 240 pages. I wouldn't have read it if I hadn't been forced to by the school. And the introductory thing is torture.
25130,-1,Wasted Time,"There is absolutely nothing captivating about this novel. Throughout the novel, only 3 major events occur: one in the beginning, one in the middle, and one at the end. The characters are flat and difficult to relate to. Overall the book was decent at best and could have been completed in no more than 50 pages or so. Hawthorne's writing is totally ridiculous. He goes on and on stating irrelevant details and fills page after page with unnecessary imagery. These pages consist of long paragraphs, some which encompass multiple pages. If I didn't have to read this for class I definitely would not have read it on my own. I'm not saying that it is a difficult novel, but it is an unpleasant one. In the end, if you are looking to read great American novels, skip over this one and go read some Steinbeck or Twain."
25137,-1,too had to read,I find the old english wording too hard to understand and too hard to read...haven't got into it too far yet but it is taking me forever to get here
25140,-1,Characterization in The Scarlet Letter,"The Scarlet Letter is overloaded with many superfluous words that requires the reader to sift through them all to get to the actual story. However, the strong characters are revealed through their actions more than through Hawthorne's descriptions. The story takes place in 17th Century Boston and Puritanical Law is heavily enforced. A young woman, Hester, has been imprisoned for getting pregnant while committing adultery. Now that the baby is 3 months old, they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town. Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships, revenge, immense guilt, and sin. This story is a historical fiction told 200 years later and is full of symbolism and the ironies of human nature and society. The ending was rather abrupt as if Hawthorne was on a writing deadline and got tired of his own story."
25143,-1,Get to the point already,Too long. Re-read this and remembered how much Hawthorne's style irritates me. There is an interesting story within but he takes WAY too long to tell it.
25157,-1,Boring,"I love Arnold and what he has accomplished so it suprised me to suggest that women should start out using 3 lb weights. Sorry, you won't get results like that. This book my be good for seniors or those with limited physical ability."
25162,-1,Not User Friendly. NOTHING that says it's BPA-free,"Nearly impossible to disassemble for cleaning.Hole for water is tiny.Bottom gets very hot to handle, food takes awhile to warm up, then remains warm for only about 20 minutes.MOST importantly, IS THIS DISH BPA-FREE OR NOT? I've seen it listed on BPA-free lists on the web, BUT, there is nothing on the package or product description that deems it so."
25166,-1,terrible movie,"I used to be a fan of The Simpsons, but now much more of a South Park kinda guy, so it's near impossible to offend me really.. The humor was good in some spots, but overall I fould it to be annoying and pointless. The emotion and general plot was pretty good, and I've always liked Sandler for his singing abilities and SNL work, but this movie was bad (some of the singing was okay, but personally I didn't like half of it). Most of the content is incredibly gross and could make you vomit if eating, but that's Sandler's great gold."
25169,-1,The music's better than the movie,"SPINOUT is another hard movie to sit through, thanks to the weak dialogue and even weaker storyline.Elvis plays a singing race car driver (for the second time), who is being chased by three women. These include a spoiled brat (Shelley Fabares), an erotic author (Diane McBain), and his own drummer (Deborah Walley).The music is actually listenable in this picture. Highlights include ""Stop, Look, and Listen"" and ""I'll Be Back"".Elvis appears to be sleepwalking through this one. His appearance is also disturbing: slightly overweight and his hair looks like a big black ball on his head.Again, not QUITE the worst, but far from the best. Buy something more worthwhile first."
25171,-1,This is NOT a bootleg,"This is simply not a bootleg. It was an overseas limited box set release. The band (or label) has done similar box sets. They did one for the Hero Of The Day single, limiting it to 1,000 copies. They also have plans to release a limited vinyl box soon. This is simply a collectable, nothing more than that. There are no music extras in this box.As a limited box it doesn't really offer very much at all. The CD you can purchase anywhere and the packaging of the actual disc(s) is no different than the standard (Vertigo) version. Do we really need a hat and a flag?For die hard collectors only."
25172,-1,Way over my head!,"This book was recommended by an instructor. I am new to this crazy pursuit of oil painting. My instructor called this her ""bible"" of color theory, but I honestly didn't understand much of it. Way too detailed, written in language that may be appropriate for someone who has a degree in fine art or art education, but certainly not for a beginner."
25177,-1,Hot lava Indeed,"I completely agree... the album seems so unlike such a thoughfull and talented band. Not to say i've lost faith in dredg , just i need some time to get over this travesty."
25178,-1,until you've walked in my shoes,"As a father of a daughter with autism, i was surprised by how little time the author contributed to the family life. More time was spent at work and then writing a book when it sounds like home would have been the place to be at this critical time for his family. He writes often about don't critize until you've walked in my shoes yet he has no problems bashing the GFCF diet which has proved helpful to many families. while written with great love for his son, i am not sure his priorities are in order."
25180,-1,Heart Becomes a Hair Band,"To me this was the beginning of the end for the Wilson sisters. Sure, there are some okay songs on here, or so I thought until I recently replaced my vinyl LP with the CD. These songs sound so dated that I can't believe I used to like them. To put it mildly, this album was Heart's contribution to the 1980s ""hair band"" movement. Synthesizers and drum machines have taken over for Nancy and Howard's guitar playing. Dreamboat Anne and Little Queen still sound as good today as they did when they were released. This CD does not."
25182,-1,SOPHMORIC,I REALLY DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS BOOK AT ALL. I FOUND BOTH THE WRITING AND THE STORY LACKING AND UNIMAGINATIVE. I BOUGHT THIS BOOK WITH AN INTEREST IN FANTASY THAT REVOLVES AROUND ELVES OR FEY. I WAS SORELY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS BOOK. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTER'S FEY HERITAGE. THE STORY ITSELF IS CHOPPY AND THE CHARACTERIZATION WEAK. A WASTE OF BOTH MONEY AND TIME. I WILL NOT BE READING ANY MORE OF THIS AUTHORS BOOKS.
25183,-1,"poor durability, hard to find replacement parts",I purchased this product 3 weeks ago. I purchased this because the ball is soft and doesn't hurt the little guys.I have 4 children that LOVE the game however after use the ball started to rip. It is now ripped from the pole and I have been unable to locate a replacement.
25186,-1,Helps . . . With reservations,"This pillow is incredibly helpful for people who have difficulty getting comfortable in bed because it affords a variety of positions to relieve painful areas. But getting in bed can require some simple gymnastic maneuvers because the pillow is so thick and cumbersome. And getting out of bed also requires some special moves, especially if you have a high mattress. Overall, not a simple process for a good nights sleep. The head area also compresses after a few nights of use and rearranging the filling is bothersome. Because it's a considerable investment, I end up using it only occasionally."
25192,-1,Good for a few months,"The adapter worked fine for my power book g4 for a few months and then it broke. Nothing physically happened to the adapter for it to break, but suddenly it just wouldn't charge any more. What's interesting is that the blue light on the brick goes on when plugged in to a power source, but if I plug the cable that attaches the computer to the brick in, the light goes out and it doesn't charge."
25194,-1,Cheap quality and non-existant service,After using the charger for about 2 weeks I started noticing drops in the power feeding to the iBook. After about 2 months the charger stopped working altogether. On inspection I noticed that the metal part of the plug was separating from the plastic part and I suspect this is causing the disconnect. MacAlly has no warranty information on their web site and I called them several times only to be diverted to a messaging system and I never got a callback.I'd say avoid if you can.
25195,-1,Mishap,"Unfortunately I shall not be able to review the Macally Power Adapter. I did not pay due attention to the fact that the AC adaptor works with G3 iBook and G4 PowerBook only.I plugged it in with a G4 iBook , it made some complaining noises and it died. Maybe it would be proper to really WARN that it will NOT work with a G4 iBook in CAPITAL LETTERS.$40.- down the drain!"
25199,-1,Power connector is not durable,"Adapter worked flawlessly for six months, then became intermittent. Seems to be broken or shorted somewhere near the connector to the computer. Even the ridiculously flimsy cord from Apple lasted longer than six months, so I can't say I'm pleased. Macally says they'll sell the connector cable separately for $17.00 which is not much of a bargain."
25214,-1,She did not get the point.,"I thought this book was a sad commentary on the lostness of the author. Though she sought to understand the Amish way of life, she totally missed what it is all about. Maybe it was because the church service was in German or maybe she was so focused on herself that she could not see beyond to the fact that peace comes from a relationship with God. Her final line in the book stated that miracles take a lot of work. I would beg to disagree and say that God is the one who does miracles and therefore they take no work, just faith. This is what Sue Bender missed and is still missing I am afraid. We use Amish textbooks in our home education program, so the insights she shared were not really new to me. I think her description of the Amish is valid, but her understanding is lacking. I would not particularly recommend this book."
25217,-1,The book presents history from a pro-arab stance.,"The book presents a historical and political account of the middle east from 1922-1984. The book was originally written in 1968, then revised in 1976 and 1985. During the process of revision, Khouri, appearantly, did not make many changes in the original text, a fact that leaves much of the book outdated. Khouri's account takes a strong anti Israeli and pro Arab stance. For example, he chooses to downplay the Palestinian terrorist attacks during the 1970s and mentions such attacks as the attack on the Israeli athletes in Munich and the attack of the Marine base in Beirut with no detail. His study is based very closely on UN records and ignores the reality of the Middle East."

25222,-1,This is high school creative writing...,"I was quite disappointed with this collection. After the first three stories, I basically gave up. Interesting concepts that could have benefited a great deal from a really good editor. This stuff really belongs in 12th grade creative writing class."
25226,-1,An Unclear Biography of Napoleon,"Napoleon is probably one of the most widely written about historical figures. There are many differing views about his intentions and ambitions. Markham takes a somewhat 'unclear' point of view when writting about the French Emperor. At times it seems like he is praising Napoleon for one thing or the other and at other times he is criticizing the ' Corsican Orge'. He laudes Napoleon's form of government as being advanced beyond its years yet he draws on unreliable memoirs which denounced Napoleon with impunity. 'Unreliable' memoirs are those which were written by those, between 1815 and 1830, who wished to regain Bourbon favour and be allowed back into prestigious positions. I feel that Markham doesn't give a very lucid explaination for the intervention in Spain or for that matter in Russia. Towards the end the picture drawn in this book becomes more nebulous, and we are given the choice between two uncompromising pictures of Napoleon."
25227,-1,shallow and unmoving,"The book was badly observed and shallow, with predictable and cliched plots. It made me want to throw up mostofthe time, and offered very little insight into the characters feelings. Do not read it unless you have to."
25229,-1,Four Star Music - get the other edition though,"Capitol's 1990 reissue of The Beach Boys' 1960s LPs gave us 2 of these albums on 1 CD at normal price. They're back for who knows how long - so get them while they're hot. On the 2-fer version of ""Little Deuce Coupe,"" which is in STEREO by the way and not MONO as it is here, you also get ""All Summer Long"" plus you get a nice stack of bonus tracks. Don't pass up this warning - and get the 2-fer instead - quick!"
25234,-1,Beautiful but Misrepresented,"The Cake dome set was beautiful. I needed a 14 inch diameter plate because I was making a 12 inch cake. The lid had an 11 inch diameter so would not fit the cake. I was disappointed because when I search Amazon for the 14 inch cake plate; there were many unrelated products choices. It was very frustrating. Amazon, please only give unasked for alternatives. I know I am going to google search my product choices to find websites that only give me what I want!"
25240,-1,small,The shoes would have been awesome but..... the sizes run extremely small.I even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen.The shoes are still too small..
25241,-1,too thin to hold weight,this product is good for child I guess..cause it is a little thin...but it is better than the one I saw on sports authority which is thiner
25242,-1,STOP. We waited 8 months for THIS ?,"I was so looking forward to Tomb Raider: AOD coming out in November 15th 2002. Then it got delayed, then delayed again, and again, and again, and again. When it finally came out (8 MONTHS LATER) I was really excited. I put the game in my PS2. And was really shocked at how bad this game was. I was expecting something incredible. But no. Lara moves like a robot, it is very difficult to control her, loads of bugs and its boring. No fun. I am a huge Tomb Raider fan and have played them all. But I think this one might be making a trip back to the shop for a refund. However, the graphics are incredible (best i've seen in any game), lara looks amazing and the music is great. But overall I am very dissapointed. EIDOS, get it right next time."
25247,-1,"Cheap Plastic Parts, Poor Quality","This machine does a decent job of cleaning when it works, but it breaks way to easily for the price, and its not built well enough to justify fixing. Too many cheap plastic parts. Consider it to be disposable if you buy it."
25248,-1,Worked at first,"When we got this product it worked great. After a year though, the pressure is next to non-existent and I cannot find a troubleshoot guide to find out what the problem is, or how to fix it. I consider myself very handy and can usually figure these things out, but this one has me stumped. It acts like there is air getting into the system and the result has been damage to the motor or something.The company is absolutely no help at all in advice for fixing this machine.Sorry, but I cannot recommend it as highly as those who are doing so."
25251,-1,Guess i missed what was cool,"I bought this thinking that it was going to be one of those major life-changing experience moments in horror or something. As i said in my title... I guess i missed what was cool. It was ok for a low budget, but even then i guess i just didn't like the story, concept or style of the movie at all. People running down an alley flailing their arms does not invoke terror to me... sorry. So i suppose this movie ranks as a: Either you hate it or Love it kinda thing. Watch a trailer, if you like what you see go for it."
25256,-1,"Good, but only to the midway point","This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer."
25258,-1,Truncated,"It would have been nice if the editor included a bibliography, so people could read an entire novel. For example, The ""Romance of Lust"" selection doesn't do its author justice. The original is a big book, wherein the author couldn't possibly have held a job anywhere since he devoted his entire day to erotic diversions. No one was safe, not even his aunt and sisters. Well, maybe the family dog. Other selections were uninteresting too. Is the editor really a Major? Why do we need his military rank in such a book? Is he still in active duty???"
25265,-1,A typical anti-Darwinism pseudoscience book,"The book contains 280 pages of text, 25 pages of refenreces, 7 pages of INDEX, and many figures and cartoon to explain the concept of author's hypothesis. Barbieri was a development biologist at MRC in Cambridge, NIH, and Max Planck.This is a typical anti-Darwinism semi-pseudoscience book. I picked up the book because the book cover had a Chomsky's accolade. It's not as obvious and outrageous as Intelligent Desing-sort of book, but the author cites his own book to explain his main points. Many biological facts in the book are real and correct, but there is no scientific logical structure to support the author's ""semantic"" theory. I was struck by the fact that this book was published from Cambridge University Press."
25266,-1,still the same old guys...,"Hello again, here we are. This is what I think after listening to the new album of Germanys' Thrash-Metal godfathers.Nothing new but still they rock like hell. Unfortunately they made a step backwards and not like Slayer or Mayhem a step forward. Well, I believe that some old school fanatics will enjoy this feature, but Sodoms'great days are gone. Their last good record was and will be ""Tapping the Vein"". I was a great fan of them for over 12 years but they just repeat themselves. I am not happy about giving such a cruel review about this record but I just had to say that. Sorry guys, better luck next time, ok?"
25271,-1,Not helpful...,"I decided to self study AP environmental science, which I eventually received a 5 for. This was a textbook I was considering to use, but I found it to be difficult to read (not to mention a bit politically-oriented). I would recommend Raven and Berg for APES, which is more concise and comprehensive for the test."
25272,-1,Not my taste in music,"Voice too ""breathy"" to suit my taste. I wouldn't say it is bad; just not the kind of music that I like."
25273,-1,ok mr.,"i like everything aphex twin has ever made (with the exception of ""elephant song""), but this album is a piece of poo covered crust (thats right ""crust""!). i think mr. smiley here is just releasing the stupidest stuff he's ever made as some sort of artsy fartsy nut chunk because these songs stink flamboyantly. the first song features a reggae ""artist"" who has too much self esteem (if your gonna get excited about something dont make it reggae lyrics). anyway i hate lyrics, so i'm a little biased. the other parts in the song consist of drums...and some other insignificant effects. the other songs consist of only the latter; no music just stuff (which i know is arguably music also, but jeez 9 minutes then the next song is the exact same stuff). now i've gone and soiled myself i hope smiley mcgee is happy."
25275,-1,Raggae Mixed With Some Weird Techno,"but man yeah yeah yeah its good and all that, but man, 9 dollars for three songs?! isn't that like an oxymoron?"
25277,-1,A highly mixed blessing (?!),"The quotes are wonderful, but the rest is an atrocity and an offense to the intellect of the reader with all the simplifications and self-pity. Please read some literature instead."
25286,-1,Works,It was a bit confusing to assemble. Had to redo a few times before I got the right rods with the right utensils. In the end you get what you paid for - bottom of the line product for cheap.
25288,-1,You get what you pay for.,"I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set, but it will have to do for now."
25289,-1,Failed to Work,I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
25292,-1,A verbose informercial,"This entire book could be summed up in 10 pages. It is terribly repetitive. The basic premise is that one can use a HELOC instead of a Checking Account so that your money doesn't sit around idle while mortgage interest is accruing. This may have some merit, but it is not clear how much of the savings is due to putting all of your disposable income towards your mortgage. The big trade off is a loss of liquidity. I have been aware of this strategy for a while, and I hoped that this book would help to prove its effectivness, and explain exactly how to do it. It falls short. After reading numerous message boards on the subject, this book tought me nothing new. It really feels like an informercial that I paid for."
25301,-1,Read the reviews first!,"I bought this on a whim, as it was the first Zen garden that I could find. I did not look at the reviews, and immediately regret it upon receiving my Zen garden. The other reviews summed it up nicely. The product is exactly what you pay for.Image:[...] - You can see the gap between the border/frame and the bottom piece. The tacks were put in, but did not hold the board to the border/frame. You should probably buy some wood glue, push lightly to separate the border, then press it back together with a small vice."
25309,-1,You get what you pay for I guess.,This radiator seems to be very cheaply built. Its aluminum and plastic! It did not even come with a radiator cap. How cheap can you get?
25310,-1,NO GOOD,"Bought this for the Christmas lights 1 for outside and one for the tree,works great EVEN WITH EVERY OTHER REMOTE YOU HAVE WILL TURN IT ON OR OFF,AND DRIVE YOU CRAZY!!!!THE CAR REMOTE/ GARAGE/ HANDY SWITCHES ALL TURNED THE LIGHTS ON"
25318,-1,weird notification beeps,This went off in the middle of the night after my husband and I had had it for several years. We had to look up online the directions because it didn't have a clear beep for a warning and for a battery replacement. It was ridiculous. I would not recommend it. I want one that clearly tells me when to vacate the house and call the fire department.
25319,-1,"My bad, but theirs too","It did not even occur to me that a plug-in CO detector would not have battery back-up, which is my fault for missing that. However, what the?? I mean, they ALL should have batter back-up. This one has to go back."
25326,-1,Not my type of book,"I just couldn't get into this book. Right from the start, it seemed like the author was trying to hide something from the reader and that annoyed me. Also, it contained too many long descriptions. Not my type of book."
25327,-1,Good Times Video...Skip it,"What Dean & Jerry fan does not know of this movie?My intention is to save those of us collectors time and money.The Good Times Video version appears to have been recorded from a vhs - that was itself recorded from another vhs without Time Base Correction - about 10 times.It's presented as Academy Standard 1.37:1 (original film aspect)Yep - that bad. Perhaps it was better than nothing, but now that something has hit the market, do yourself a favor, skip this version."
25330,-1,Old School Rocket,Launcher broke after a couple of flights. Not surprising for the cost. These were popular when I was a kid and this model WAS enjoyable while it lasted.
25333,-1,Aesthetically pleasing but not functional,"While I like the looks of this set a lot, with its retro feel, I find the shaker to be in need of a design overhaul. Every time this is used (and it's been used by several people so I don't think it's a user problem) it spills while pouring! This has been very frustrating to lose good top shelf vodka because of poor design. I had to go out and purchase another shaker because of this problem so I would not recommend this set."
25343,-1,Poor quailty,Item sizing was not consistent. Had to make modifications just to wear it and make it fit. Cheap and torn before could even use it.
25344,-1,ok,"This costume is very flimsy, but the bright pink color is great. The only problem we had was the elastic on the mask was too short to fit my daughter's head. So I cut it off and used glue dots to glue the mask onto a pair of sunglasses that I pushed the lenses out of. Perfect fit and much easier to wear!"
25347,-1,Expect what you pay for,"The price was cheap and so was a majority of the craftsmanship. Also, the belt was not in the package and we bought it new."
25349,-1,Wouldn't recommend,"The sizing of this costume was fairly accurate but it very cheaply made. After only a few wears, the mask and belt both broke. I wouldn't recommend this costume."
25354,-1,Shower Curtain Rod Review,"Umbra Coretto 24 to 36-Inch Decorative Tension Rod, BlackThe rod is really good looking. However, because it is so thin, the weight of my shower curtain keeps causing the rod to come loose. If I had any idea, I probably would not have bought the rod. However, my shower is at the wider end....so maybe a person would have better luck if their shower is closer to 24""."
25355,-1,Longevity,I was initially impressed with the company and the product. The company ended up to be local which was a plus. The product didn't last a year and I purchased two of them. Both failed inside of a year.
25359,-1,thumbs down,"I don't actually own this album, but I did buy Apple Venus, and I'll say this: I hope that this album has the charm that that album lacked. I've never been so disappointed with an XTC album. Why would one buy an album of the exact same songs, except in demo form? A shoddy attempt to extract money, it seems. Shame on you, XTC!"
25362,-1,fragile.. fragile....very fragile...,I've had 6 of them for 1 month and one of them got lips chiped out already. (which one of the reviewer already commented that it happens often with these mug). It was sadly tossed out and now I'm worried they will eventually all dissapear out of my kitchen.Keep them apart from each other when you wash them. The slightest touch will chip it out unexpectedly.BTW: You can buy them individually at Bed and Bath Beyond for less price.
25365,-1,Much ado about latin ballroom tango,"This version of tango is not argentine. It is ballroom latin american whatever you call it. Very misleading to call it argentine tango. But if you like ballroom dancing, maybe this video is for you."
25368,-1,this book was a big dissapointment,"I found this book to be very out of date. I can't count how many times I read ""coming in 2000"" and then no info on the subject. I didn't expect this from a book written for 2001. I have the 2000 official guide and it is much more up to date. The only thing I liked about the book is the coverage of non disney parks. This book was a huge waste of money."
25369,-1,"Wait for the ""final"" boxset to be released","This DVD Trilogy box contains the two-disc editions of SM 1&2 and the single-disc edition of Spidey 3. However, 1 and 3 are available separately in 3-disc sets, and I'd be surprised if 2 wasn't given the 3-disc treatment right before Christmas. So, when the 3-disc editions of all 3 movies are available in one box (think Ultimate Matrix Collection), then that will be the one to buy. This box can be skipped."
25375,-1,will it never end!?,"Small print, difficult to read. But wait - I might learn something here. So I use a magnifier and plug away. Nope - boring. There is absolutely no reason this research cannot be presented more simply. Well, maybe the author just wanted to impress other academics by being obscure. I hope he succeeded. But this isn't for ordinary people who want to understand the history and development of neo-paganism. There are lots of other, better written, more accessible, books out there that do a better job!"
25376,-1,Annoyingly necessary profit generator for Sony,"Works as described. I am just so annoyed that Sony would lure me into buying their video camera for a competitive price without including this cable, making the overall cost of the camera no longer competitive. It's smart for Sony to conduct business this way, but only in order to earn profit in the short term. You can bet I won't be suckered in to buying any more Sony products in the future, now knowing that this is how they run their business."
25379,-1,"Very ordinary performances, mediocre video quality","The musical performances here are quite dull. There is nothing wrong about them except that the musicians seem to be simply doing their job and nothing else. If I had paid good money for this concert in person, I would have been highly disappointed. The video quality is even worse. The DVD is cheap but not cheap enough to justify its purchase."
25391,-1,Disappointing,"The Mothman story is indeed a fascinating one. Unfortunately, the same adjective cannot be applied to ""The Mothman Prophecies."" John Keel's theories regarding the nature and origin of UFOs in general and Mothman in particular are more bizarre than the phenomena themselves. I was also put off by Mr. Keel's tedious obsession with men (in black) behaving badly.I've given this singularly overrated book two stars, rather than only one, because it does supply some (albeit nowhere near enough) information on the extraordinary occurrences of more than 30 years ago."
25392,-1,"repetitive, lackluster","I wanted to read this before seeing the film. Wow, what a bore. Keel's book reads like some scatter-shot diary with himself as the narrator. Maybe this stuff was revelatory back when it was originally published, but now with the X-Files cultural phenomena and all the other media about UFOs and the paranormal floating around, this seems pedestrian in comparison. The descriptions are always the same. Only the names change each chapter/sighting/contacting.Also, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK before seeing the movie. It will sap some of your enjoyment from Mark Pellington's excellent film (in fact, I was amazed at how well screenwriter Richard Hatem took this dross and put a narrative structure around it, but that's another review that belongs elsewhere....)"
25393,-1,mothman-putting the loose ends together?,"I found the movie leading in many directions....Why was John's wife appearing in Point Pleasent? Was this the mothman? Why did John appear for Gordon 3 nights at 2:30 a.m? These questions were never answered in the movie.... or did I miss something? The movie ran long for me, maybe because of the loose ends. I could be wrong, you decide. Go see the movie......"
25397,-1,Reads Like Keel's dropped his notes and never rearranged them,"Excellent and suspenseful information. All over the place as far as the material. We travel back and forth from West Virgina to London to Ohio... and back again. Would have enjoyed it if the first part of the book was supporting information as to the phenomena itself and how it has indeed appeared elsewhere in history, how the phenomena ties to UFO sightings etc. but Keel's hypothesis that all paranormal activity comes from a parallel universe it difficult to believe, even for paranormal studies. I'm sure that is a first.Although the book was suspenseful and written well, it was just organized poorly. Revise, John. You can do it."
25398,-1,BORING!,"The subject matter is fascinating and has the potential to make an exciting, fast moving read. Unfortunately the presentation is disorganized, repetetive and BORING. I had to force myself to finish the thing and ended up wondering what the heck the point was meant to be. I certainly didn't feel that I had acquired any clear understanding of what happened in Point Pleasant; I didn't even get enough out of it to decide whether I believe any of the stories or not. If you want the book, borrow it from someone and save your money."
25410,-1,"interesting, but...","it's an interesting idea to have a operatic female vox in a metal band; however, her voice is mediocre (you'd know it's true if you know some names from the opera genre), and the music is not original at all. Does anyone know any similar bands (with operatic female vox) that are better than this? Let me know. Thanks!"
25414,-1,I couldn't get into it,"I just coulAfter getting more than 50% through the book, I had to stop ... I just couldn't get into it and didn't like the writting style."
25415,-1,Not complimentary.,This book really disappointed me. It seems like a narrative. No real plot just a rambling repetitive narration of a poor island child. I wish I could say I loved it....but felt really let down.
25430,-1,Not Dean Koontz's best,"This Frankenstein series started off with 3 1/2 stars and deteriorated downward with every new volume. Not up to Mr. Koontz's standard of edge of your seat, nail biting suspense I've come to love."
25432,-1,Neat package but very grainy indoor quality,"Things I like...- price- sizeThing I didn't like and made me return- performance under regular indoor house lighting very grainy and considerably worse than my 8mm analog. Doing further research it appears this is likely not unique to Canon but common to DV camcorders. I am going to stick with my 8mm for a couple of years until DV tech improves since much of my use is indoors filming kids, etc."
25434,-1,Anesthesia for the gifted,"I checked this book out of the public library in hopes of gaining some insight into the many kinds of difficulties an adult faces upon learning of his/her giftedness. Instead, this book was full of Oprah-like perky advice, sprinkled liberally with sleep-inducing anecdotes about ""Heather"" and ""James"" et cetera.The author does not have the gifted reader in mind with this book. It is overstuffed with fluff and not enough substance. I have yet to find a book on gifted adults that speaks to us at our own level of intellect and cogently outlines issues and strategies that we face with our unique brains."
25435,-1,Mediocre,"This is a mediocre book at best. The tests give you an illusion that you are a genius too. It is full of self fullfiling falacies. If you think you are a genius, you are... maybe not. Just review your scores on the SAT, GMAT, GRE, or whatever test you have taken. If you did not score in the top percentile, don't call yourself a genius because the tests within these books said so. That is if you don't want to embarass yourself in public, or even in private company.There are far better books out there on how to train and develop your multiple intelligences. This is not the one.Check authors like Michael Gelb, Tony Buzan, Thomas Armstrong, Howard Gardner, and David Coleman. They have developed a ton of serious well researched materials and methods on this subject. They all provide far better stuff than this book."
25436,-1,I was promised new!!,"well, they promised me ""NEW"" but this book is far from being new. Marking all over the book means it's not new, the cover torn at some parts means that this isn't new!!"
25446,-1,"Bad fence, Bad tilt","The rail keeps popping up, so the plastic endcaps are no longer flush with the table. I had to file them down so the tile won't get caught. The tilting table will move apart at the hinge when I start pushing the tile through the blade, it is just useless. Straight cuts seemed to work OK. This may be suitable for small around the house jobs. I think the design is from England. Bad British engineering !!"
25448,-1,Movie Version is Much better!,"The movie version of this song is much better. The Mariah/Whitney version is simply just a screaming contest to see who can sing better. I admit the song is beautiful and touching, but it would have been better if one of them sung it instead of it being a competition. Buy the soundtrack and listen to the movie version. It showcases the song in a much better light."
25456,-1,Small type,"My review centers on only one thing - the type size. This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldn't require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don't believe Our Lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose."
25462,-1,Glad to be of this century,I didn't like the book. The language was difficult to read and in the end the topic was one i don't agree with. The ultra right values where women were always at fault for tempting a man and she was the one dealt final cruel punishment. I am relieved to be of this century. Makes us appreciate what we have and what those before us had to suffer for us to be where we are now.
25467,-1,so boring.....,"the story itself is original(using a common character instead of some nobility), but the story just keeps drugging on forever or something. It is a novel, not a prose!! I wonder why the author had to waste bunch of pages expressing the emotions of the heroin? And I think Tess is terribly idiodic. Why should she continue to love her unforgiving and cruel husband? Isn't that such a degradation of female saying that they will always be loyal to the man no matter how the men desert them? So,do not even try to read this book if you have no time."
25472,-1,Ummm,I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it. The liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything to/for my skin. Jury's sill out for me...
25476,-1,A wispy shadow of Kundera's book...,"Making my comparison to Milan Kundera's book, I have to rate this movie fairly low. I don't believe Kaufman was able to capture the essence of Kundera's writing with this film representation. So much of Kundera's writing is internal to the characters, which is difficult (at best) to communicate on screen. Unfortunately, this is the richest part of the experience; I recommend the book, but found the movie decidedly unsatisfying."
25477,-1,The Unbearable Lightness of Being Boring,"This is well acted, beautifully filmed...and pretentious exitentialist tripe. There's a difference between TRYING to be deep and serious, and being deep and serious. This movie doesn't know the difference. Long and slow."
25479,-1,Extremely Let Down,"While a big Hendrix fan, as well as a fan of bluegrass - I was NOT impressed with this album. While the ""bluegrass"" was acceptable, it was a big stretch to extract the ""hendrix"" from what I was hearing. If you want a good Hendrix tribute album, try ""Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix"" (1993). You want a good bluegrass album? Try Seldom Scene.Overall, a nice concept gone terribly awry."
25482,-1,"The official company biography -- dated, aging, but interesting.","This is the only official history of the giant utility that serves most of northern and central California. Written in 1950, when the company (and its official biographer) were heedless of the changes that the future held in store for the energy industry overall (and utilities in particular) as well as for the end of unbridled growth and development in the state of California. Coleman is a real booster for PG&E. If you want the PR line, from the generation that build the company between 1930 and the 1950, this is the reference book you want."
25483,-1,old music,Music from the 30's and very nostalgic. My father played with this band when he was still in college in 1934.
25485,-1,You can't be sure what you're getting,"I ordered the samples of this product because I was interested in trying the sulphate free shampoo, which is expensive. The samples are REALLY random, so you may not get ones you actually wanted to try. Most of the ones I got were things I wasn't interested in. And I didn't get the shampoo sample. They say you can return it for a refund, less shipping and handling, but the shipping and handling were double the cost of the product itself."
25492,-1,One show about nothing is enough,"OK, I know this is a beat classic, and it was written by Jack Kerouac the patron saint of beat literature. But I gotta say this novel was pretty damn boring.Dhama Bums is another semi-fictional novel based on real events that occurred in Kerouac's life after the events described in On the Road. It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens. I guess one meandering trip for me was enough. As far learning anything about Buddhism through the novel, my guess is that you would learn more from a real Buddhist like the Dalai Lama than a wannabee like Kerouac."
25497,-1,not worth it,mediocre at best Story line was bad; dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest. they used one liners from previous movies.
25527,-1,Lights out on this awful film,"I went to see this with the hope of getting Revenge of the Fallen's bad taste out of my mouth.Fission MailedWhere to begin? The plot, while being nowhere near as ""immature"" as ROTF, still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense. It's an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film. It's clear that Bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty, but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life. It's not his forté and hasn't been since The Rock. The movie peaks with a huge, final battle in Chicago that is nuts, but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place. The 3D is well used in spots, but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown. Do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection."
25533,-1,Can't believe I gave this 2 stars,"I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan I'll watch almost anything once. This is one of those one watch movies. A huge disappointment and not enjoyable at all. The first half of the movie is spent trying to make you lust after Huntington-Whiteley. She is so one dimensional that she's impossible to like, let alone think she's appealing. There was zero chemistry between Huntington-Whiteley and LaBeouf. They wasted half the film trying to show how LaBeouf could be the worst bumbler of all time and how everyone knew it. Somebody in the studio obviously doesn't understand the Sci-Fi audience."
25536,-1,Quality,The HD streaming always fails...The movie itself was fun to watch and very enjoyable. It would be nice if the streaming quality held up.
25542,-1,"Terrible plot, interesting effects.","I'm a big fan of Transformers going back to the 1980s cartoons. This movie, like all the other recent ones, do a major disservice to the franchise. But at least it looks good while doing it."
25545,-1,Well no.,"Cheesy, rushed and too much Shia. Bay's twist on this is not liked by me and much better could have been done. But what do I know? The animated movie was excellent compared to this crap and even the games War for Cybertron and the Fall of Cybertron make this movie look bad. Action parts were ok."
25547,-1,Good prints... bad compatibility,"I've had the P1000 for a couple of years. Worked great with WindowsME. After installing XP on my desktop I had to reinstall the printer software to get it to work. Just got a new laptop and it doesn't work at all.. in fact, the P1000 causes my Dell Inspiron to crash whenever I disconnect the USB cable. When the cable is connected the laptop never recognizes the printer."
25554,-1,Mildly entertaining at best,"This movie had bad acting and a thin plot. Could have been much better. Lots of action, lots of explosions but didn't seem like a good Blu-ray quality movie. It killed 2 hours but nothing i would recommend to a friend to watch."
25578,-1,Not My Favorite,"I found this tape very disappointing, it was fun to watch once, but the amount of information provided was very small and too choppy. There are many belly dance instructional videos available which are more interesting, better taught and more informative about how to dance and which provide you with a workout as well. My recommendation is to keep looking."
25583,-1,"Great boot, Sturdy, Comfortable, But those darn laces!!","They keep coming untied! If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars. The boot is waterproof, it is comfortable, wont give you calluses or corns. But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it, they will inevitably become undone! The first time: ""umm? maybe I should tie them tighter"", The second time: ""just a little tighter, Ugh it's cutting my circulation"", The third time: ""Ok this is ridiculous, let me try tying em different"", the unfteenth time: ""you m$#%^ stupid $%^ Boot from hell $%^&..."" lol I threw the boots into a lake and hiked in my sandals the rest of the way... Never again will I buy boots with hooks for tying...thanks for reading"
25589,-1,an offbeat non-standard method of casting,"I would not buy this again - it teaches a non-standard supposedly ""new"" methof of casting"
25592,-1,Lean Pickin's,"Beautifully photographed but over-produced historical women's picture on an epic scale. Yes, it has its fans but so do those dime-a-dozen bodice-ripper romance novels on supermarket racks. Still, gorgeous cinematography and a lusher-than-lush musical score can't disguise the fact that this David Lean misfire is an overblown snooze of elephantine proportions. A pallid Sarah Miles manages to suggest what Julie Christie might have done with this part, horribly miscast Robert Mitchum plays a flower-pressing milquetoast and a dazed-looking Christopher Jones is so bad his voice had to be dubbed. However, John Mills received richly-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of village idiot struck dumb by plot inanities he witnesses in mute silence. No wonder he's speechless."
25593,-1,Irish movie,The lead actress does a poor job of acting.Was recently in Ireland and stopped at the location of this film.
25600,-1,I was better off with Alexandra Stoddard....,"Very much like Alexandra Stoddard's books, too much alike. Stoddard's books are less wordy and still get to the point. I stopped reading this book when the similarities became clear, been there done that. If you are looking for something in the ""guidance"" area, try Stoddard. She has many better books. I have some and re-read them often for refreshers and finding the ""gems"" I forgot about."
25602,-1,"I appreciate what he attempted, but...","I appreciate what the author was attempting to do, but do not feel the book succeeds. It is too dry to read on its own (as a sort of William Safire-style curmudgeon rant on language), and not comprehensive enough to be a useful desk reference.In addition, the first 30 or so pages are actually a biography of the author (who died a few years ago) by one of his colleagues. Perhaps to someone researching Lasch himself (who was, admittedly, a renown academic) this material would be interesting, but it isn't in the context of language reference."
25607,-1,The only good song is the first track.,"The only good song is the first track. Unless you can find a single of the first track, save your money. The rest of the CD is trash."
25615,-1,"Loved it, then it left me...","This is the 3rd HP printer I have owned and it has broken the fastest. My first one was around for four years of college, then it died. The second, an 820 Cse lasted about 18 months. The 940c lasted me just over a year and died. Add to this the fact that the cartridges are expensive (I'm stuck with 6 of them) and don't last terribly long.I'm thinking laser to replace this one, and a Canon inkjet for color printing."
25616,-1,HP 940C,"After using this printer for one year (home use), a plastic bracket to which a spring attaches to maintain belt tension on the print cartridge carriage broke. Rather than try to get a new part, I'm going to throw this printer away and buy a new one."
25618,-1,worked great until it just STOPPED working at all!,"I replaced an EPSON about 6 months ago that worked for about 9 months before the paperfeed went out. I thought I was ""movin' up"" by purchasing an HP, well, this one stopped working after 6 months: the printer carriage gets hung up on the right. I went to the website for troubleshooting options, none of which solved the problem....and the warranty is the biggest weakness...90-days! This alone speaks poorly of the expectations HP has of its own products. EPSON's warranty was 1 YEAR, but I had misplaced the receipt. SO, perhaps EPSON is a better deal, as long as you KEEP THE RECEIPT!"
25625,-1,what masterpiece?,"This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day, it is bereft of it now."
25630,-1,tough going,"I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that's just one of the series!"
25632,-1,Just not my kind of book - Others liked it.,"It isn't my kind of book but, I thought, I would give it a try. We read it in our book club. Some of the readers liked it, most of them didn't. I didn't. But, the author did have great insight to the future in the 1950 - 1960's"
25633,-1,"Good printer, so so on photos, crap for envelopes.",I have just spent 5 minutes trying to get this damn printer to print an envelope without mangling it. Wonderful.
25651,-1,Spanish,In description this serie specific dubbed to spanish but is not real only English language. Not subtitules in spanish.Mal mal mal. But Is very funny.
25653,-1,if you are buying cuz of Pearl Jam don't...,"The Ramones meet AC/DC. A live record with the song covered by Pearl Jam. Not a great recording. The songs are good, would rather hear studio versions. If you are looking to buy cause of the Pearl Jam song.. don't waste your money. Otherwise they are a good band but the production is no good!"
25657,-1,Mixed Bag,"This compilation contains some of the best jazz guitar ever in songs like Scotland I, the Jam with Albert and Yin. Unfortunately it also digs up silly tripe like Eyes of Love, Planet End, Adam Smasher and Rene's Theme. The shorter compilation, the Essential Larry Coryell is less expensive, more consistent and manifestly superior to this double CD."
25661,-1,dry,This book was really dry... there were a couple interesting moments but most of the book was a lot of unnecessary words. This is one of the very few books that I didn't finish!
25665,-1,Cult classic...,"There is no doubt that this is a cult classic, and there is plenty of reason for it to stay that way. Overall, it was predictable and somewhat lacking in screen presence. I can't really put my finger on what it is that makes the film worth the purchase, but I will admit that it is an interesting example of Australian movie making in the 70's.The story line is somewhat disturbed and there are significant reasons to not allow children to watch this, and really, there is little reason for me to suggest that anyone not completely bored with other avenues of moviemaking watch it either."
25667,-1,Dubbed into American English,"This DVD is the U.S. release, in which the original Australian dialog (including Mel Gibson's) was replaced with dubbed dialog in ""American English""."
25668,-1,Blah,"I thought this movie was boring and it didn't let you get to know any of the characters. The only good thing in this movie is a young, cute Mel Gibson."
25669,-1,The sword in the sux,Well iu thin that this book should've had a first book. Its very confusing and boring its so long I did not like it !!!!!!!!!!!
25670,-1,Not their best outting,"I am going to have to disagree with most of the other reviews posted here. This is not the best that Stereolab has to offer. The first Stereolab records I heard were Dots & Loops and Cobra and Phase... I was absolutely blown away by those albums. I just couldn't get that excited about this one though. The songs are just kind of lifeless; they have some interested ideas, but never really get anywhere with them. It has the same Stereolab sound without any bounce or interplay between the instruments. I would recommend Dots & Loops over this one 7 days a week and twice on Sunday"
25671,-1,disappointing,"Hoover's choice of international financial manipulation as subject matter for this novel is timely and raised my expectations. Instead most of the story is pulpy romance surrounding a contrived conflict between Japanese investors scheming to revive Imperial Japan and American regulators intent on saving the free world. The only thing missing from this ""B"" grade movie plot are black and white hats to differentiate the bad guys from the good guys. Not at all what I had hoped for."
25677,-1,This book is good but I wouldn't call it great.,"I liked Rashel and Quinn, they really go together. It was cool how she hunted down vampires and killed them. I loved it when they burned down the house."
25684,-1,Buy another version. Any other version.,"Who told Antonio Banderas he could sing? He can't. Madonna can but could only sing this score, one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's good ones (and they are becoming rare items), if Hollywood had it lowered for her. This does spoil the balance of the musical, but Hollywood doesn't care about things like that. They also gave her a song belonging to another character which makes no dramatic sense whatsoever. Hollywood doesn't care about things like that, either.There are many recordings of the stage musical available. Buy one of those instead."
25688,-1,All of mine have not lasted long.,"A comfortable bed for the money. But I've had 7 or 8 of these, and they ALWAYS fail in one of two ways:1) An external seam will break, usually near the head area. To fix it, use a good size piece of Gorilla Tape (forget the enclosed repair kit) and press down very hard around the leak so no air can get out. No need to deflate or remove flock from the area, but you have to press down carefully and firmly.2) An internal seam will pop (usually in the middle) and create a huge bubble in the center. No way to fix that, unless you want to use pillows or folded blankets to level out the low areas.That's my advice. I'm still looking for a good, sturdy alternate model."
25698,-1,Faulty advertising,"At 80"" iong, this is an extra long twin, not a standard twin. Consequently I had to take back the sheets I bought, as they were 5"" too short. I would have ordered a different model had I known that 80"" wasn't standard. It's easier just to replace the sheets and I don't have time to send the bed back."
25701,-1,"Was hopeful, but . . .","I was hopeful this mattress would work out, having read mixed reviews, but as others stated, the mattress held air for only several days before it started losing air during the night. My son would then have to turn the air pump on (during the night) in order to have be able to have a comfortable night of sleep. Generally speaking I think all air mattresses do the same thing, as I then purchased one from the local K-mart, which is also going back tomorrow for the same problem."
25702,-1,I so wanted to love this item,"Was very comfortable when I inflated it, but had deflated twice before the night was over. Boasts features like beds twice the price -- the internal 120 AC pump is handy (especially since it deflates so fast) but it is noisy,and who wants to interrupt their sleep twice a night to reinflate the bed? Not me, that's for sure. I really wish it hadn't been a leaker, I like this bed, everything about it except that."
25703,-1,Valve broke after a couple of uses,"My mother bought this bed for my 5 year old to use when we visited on weekends. Worked great the first 4 or so times she used it. But now the valve that lets the air out won't close. It spins, but does not seal shut so you can't inflate the mattress. Very poor quality."
25708,-1,slow leaking,"Air mattress: Looks good, works but requires frequent running of pump. Appears to lose air through the built-in pump. Should have returned the mattress but need the bed for visitor. Probable would not buy with built-in pump in future."
25710,-1,Not Durable,Had the bed two weeks and so far not a problem. I did not inflate it to the maximum pressure-I'm 250lbs the maximum load being 300lbs-but rather 3/4 full of air. I have added air only one time-maybe 10 seconds. I sleep on this airbed every night. There is a tendancy for me to roll to the side of the bed-whether that's just me or the bed is yet to be seen. To add to this review I had the bed for three months-the pump went out after that time. I suppose we take our chances.MalcolmL
25712,-1,Worst Air Bed Ever.,This mattress began leaking after only 3 or 4 nights of use. I found the leakbetween a crease in the top (flocked) side. After proper repair effort it wasunable to stay inflated. I have put the air bed to better use. Thank youKeith Colton
25721,-1,You're Kidding!,I just screened the dvd of The Band which cost $65.00! If you like 75 minutes of interviews with some musical clips (all far better in The Last Waltz--where each song is 100% seen on camera and mixed great) than send me $55.00 and I'll ship you my copy. I love The Band but this looks like a BBC TV doc.Bill
25723,-1,way too big,"This product is NOT intended for a beginner...i had many toys and this one by far caught me by suprise on how big it is. The shaft is too big and makes it uncomfortable unless used with the right lubrication. Being a smaller/petite woman, it was a little uncomfortable for me b/c of the size...but other than that, it was very pleasurable."
25736,-1,Ouch!,The ears on the rabbit are sharp and the first time I used it I felt like it cut me after wards. If the ears weren't so sharp this toy would be higher on my list of favorites.
25737,-1,Reviews are so off--terrible!,"I had high hopes for this product after the Rabbit Habit's beads froze the first time I used it. I thought the way the beads were set in this product would be better and it was, BUT...the material is so stiff that the action of the bunny ears actually HURT my clit! None of the softness and thus realistic tongue like action of the Rabbit Habit. That's really the point, isn't it? It just poked me, along with the hard little nose, which also hurt. Cheap, but a waste of money."
25741,-1,Not pelased,"I was not pleased with this product, the bunny ears does not reach my ""pretty bump"".....I haven't used it ever since...I bought another for $25 and it got to the work done way better than this..."
25755,-1,Too Small,Hard to tell from the picture what size this is. I thought it was much larger. It would not hold much more than a 1/2 pound of coffee. Too much space is wasted for the filter holder section.
25756,-1,misleading photo,"There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also, do not be fooled by the ""too good to be true"" price. They charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store.Otherwise, the package arrived in a timely manner, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier."
25759,-1,"Son loves it, but it does fall apart","My son does love this toy and plays with it every day since Santa brought it to him. It has fallen apart each time he plays with it and has fallen on him a couple of times, so if you have a small child, I wouldn't recommend it.I will attempt to GLUE the legs on, since they are the biggest problem for this toy. Everything else works just great. Elevator, noises, guns, etc."
25763,-1,Where is her tell-tale wit?!,"I was so disappointed with this book! I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's books under the name SK and have read all of them many times, but this was the first book I'd read written under her name Madeleine Wickham. I thought the story was incredibly boring. There is no humor and no one is remotely witty! The characters were all one-dimensional and not lovable at all like her other female heroines. Nothing happened and the pace was unbearably slow. I plan to read other books under the name Madeleine Wickham because the woman herself is a fabulous writer, but I didn't see her regular spark in Cocktails for Three at all."
25764,-1,Boring...,I couldn't get into this one. I felt the story was lacking and dragging on. I didn't get through half of it before I gave up.
25772,-1,notes are not on the left page - get the other version,"There are 2 versions of this book available on Amazon. The other version looks identical in the picture but if you look inside, it isn't. This one does not have the ""translation"" of Shakespeare on the left page, which is what most high school students need. If you want the notes, get the other book."
25782,-1,Cheap,"This was a gift, but the fabric was cheap and didn't look great on or last well. However It was fun, and I got compliments on it all night."
25786,-1,Had to buy this for a class-- not very informative,"The chapters are set up like a pamplet with bulleted information. It just doesn't seem appropriate for a college class. It is written like a middle school textbook, and it doesn't offer more information than what most laymen already know."
25794,-1,Cheating,"David Weber uses a trick in this book that I think is cheating at writing, and not in a good way. One chapter ends with the main characters in dire straits, and then the next one starts with them having overcome the problem without any explanation. Did he get tired of writing or is he just inept?Otherwise I'd say that I would recommend the book to readers age 12-16. To an adult the characters seems a trifle ""fantastic""."
25795,-1,FRUSTRATED!,I had TWO of these products sent to me and BOTH of them were inoperatable and the packaging on one of them was open...ughhhh...VERY disappointed not to mention frustrated!
25820,-1,"Easy installation but unreliable Firewire slots, slow warranty repair","I've had this card installed since Nov. 2006 and just now found out that the 2 Firewire ports only work intermittently. I thought my new camcorder was messed up when I tried to use the Firewire port on the Iogear card. But when I plugged into another non-Iogear available Firewire slot, the camcorder worked. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to get warranty work for the Iogear card. The USB ports on the card have worked okay.Update: Over 3 weeks and I'm still awaiting my warranty work repair/replacement from Iogear.3-23-07 Update: Finally got the warranty replacement. Everything seems to be working now. I would now rate this about 3 stars."
25821,-1,Not all that profound after all,"I had read this book over 30 years ago as a teenager and thought it would be interesting to see how I reacted to it now. It's a fun and easy read, I'll admit that. But I can see why I liked it more as a 14-year-old; the book seems to have been written by a 14-year-old. And the ""moral dilemmas"" are of the kind you probably dealt with when you first learned what a ""moral dilemma"" is.And although the copy I read was a paperback from the early 1980's that was in its umpteenth printing, it had a surprising number of typos and major grammatical errors. I guess even back then no one took the book too seriously."
25826,-1,Not water resistant -- one spill ruined the look,1. The 6 and 9 pieces are interchangeable...that led to some confusion.2. I want this same puzzle with no glossy paper glued on. The remains of a drink were spilled onto it and the paper is now peeling off and it also absorbed the stainThe whole reason I buy wooden toys is for durability -- this same toy with just a stained/painted/plain wood would be perfect
25845,-1,Horrible.,"I have had the first DVD since I bought my first dance hoop over a year ago, and figured that I would give the second one a try. This DVD is horrible! The picture and sound quality sucks. The picture is grainy and the sound is off. I could have made a better DVD in my backyard with my small camera. It is over-priced and they could have fit so much more in one DVD. I am so dissapointed that Hoopnotica would put out such a low quality product."
25846,-1,Cheap!,"I haven't been able to watch this much because the DVD won't play in my normal (otherwise functioning) DVD player. It will play on my computer's DVD player, but without sound. The DVD will play fine on my laptop, but that's not a screen that's very conducive to practicing in front of. The DVD does play on my friend's DVD player for some reason. Also, I bought volumes 1 and 2 and both are so short, it seems obvious that they could have put all of the lessons on one DVD. I guess they knew they could make more money by making us buy both."
25863,-1,"Great player, bad job with the refurbish","We bought this player for my mother, as I have the same one and love it. But, this player had problems from the get go, being a refurbished model. Sansa support was good, but their fix for the problem only lasted a matter of hours. We eventually had to return it, which was a fast and painless process with Amazon.The player, when it works correctly is great. I can't even begin to fill mine up with songs, videos and recordings. The FM recorder is great for lectures, conventions and other occasions. The sound quality is amazing. I also love that, unlike the e200 series you can format and also erase songs directly on the player without using your computer. It also conveniently has a spot for audiobooks and podcasts. Also to note that you can download shows and movies from amazon to play on this player.It was tough giving a star rating as this particular player was broken, but knowing from experience that they can make wonderful mp3 players."
25866,-1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this earlier this year, thinking I am getting an upgrade from my Sansa M250.Wish I was not soo quick to throw out my old player.Its really fustrating when it syncs with the computer after disconnecting it takes hours ( by then the battery is drained) to power off from the connected mode.I hate thisproduct. Get the real deal save yourself some fustration and money. Not worth it.Beware!"
25878,-1,Quit working after 3 hours,"The adapter quit working after 3 hours of use. I returned it and got a full refund. The customer service for the return and refund was excellent, and I would not hesitate to deal with this company again. But I won't buy any replacement power adapter for a 4-year-old laptop again. I got a new laptop."
25882,-1,Not Happy,"I am a complete Sudoku addict and am very disappointed with this book. The only reason I bought it was because I was desperate for more puzzles and it was the only one available at the store I was in. First of all, it costs $4.99 which to me, is way too much money when you can get a Kappa book for $1.99 which has better puzzles. Another thing that bugs me about this book is that some of the answer keys in the back don't match the corresponding puzzles. When I get to the difficult/Very Challenging ones in the back, sometimes I need a little help! But unfortunately, this book has quite a few errors in the answer section so when I've hit a dead end, it's over.I would recommend Kappa books from your local supermarket. This simply costs too much money for not mush quality."
25899,-1,scottiesgems,I bought this to see if using the gels would help keep my Jawbone in place. None of the gels fit in my ear.
25900,-1,Poor excuse for a great story,"I watched this movie this year after I read the book. The movie switches the story a lot and the acting is very dissapointing- the actors of Odysseus, Penelope and Telemachus, the main parts are not very talented. I would show this to a child to give them a taste of the Odyssey, but if you have read the book or are planning to, watching this will ruin the flavor of the Odyssey."
25904,-1,Agonizingly Long,"Like reviewer Jueichi Shen who said it felt like it took him the length of the Odyssey itself to watch it, I thought this movie was agonizingly long at 3 hours and 38 minutes. I will never watch it again, so this one is headed for the public library and a status of tax deduction. Good special effects, though hence my 2-star rating."
25908,-1,The Diamond Hunters,"This book is one of Wilbur Smith's early books and it shows.After reading his books set in ancient Egypt, I bought this thinking it would be a good read. He spent too much time on the relationships and too little time on the meat of the story which should have been the search for the elusive diamonds. I was able to finish it but was very disappointed particularly with the ending. It was as if he ran out of steam or got into a hurry. The ending in the book just left you wishing that he would have given you a little more to tie up the loose ends. Not a bad book but, not a great one either."
25910,-1,Totally Unbelievable Tale,This book falls in the bottom five of the 28 books that I have read by Wilbur Smith. There is no review of the African continent that is so prevalent in his other books. No intermingling of the diverse peoples that populate this country that you find in most of these books. Here there is nothing here but greed and sex without purpose and typical family squabbles.To my knowledge diamond mining has never been done in this fashion in Africa.
25924,-1,inside not as good as the cover,"The cover of this book makes the masks look intricate and impressive. On the inside, they look cartoonish. For a Halloween costume, I had more success by blowing up photos of Noh masks on a photocopier and then cutting out the eyes."
25927,-1,It drags,"I tried a couple of times to read this book. Each time I stopped half way through. It dragged in places and was OK in others, but it's definately not up to Mercedes' usual standard. The book finally wound up in the ""donate to the library"" pile."
25933,-1,Disappointing,"Having read Under the Tuscan Sun three times, this movie was very disappointing in the way that a beautiful story became a run of the mill chick flick. As beautiful as the scenery was, the movie made Tuscany lose it's charm and warmth that I received in the book."
25942,-1,barely cosi cosi (so so),"This might be an ok movie to watch on a weekend when you're bored and have absolutely nothing better to do. Of course it's nothing like the book. It's terribly contrived with some very unlikely scenes. For example, there's this one scene where the long-haired Chinese man that shows up for an extended visit after his girlfriend dumps him actually gives birth. That just can't happen in real life!! Guys can't get pregant (yet)!! Anyway, forget about the movie. Read the book."
25966,-1,wrong trikke in box,"I purchased this Trikke thinking that it would be a great surprise for my son on his birthday. When I received the Trikke it was missing two pieces. This Trikke came in a box that didnt match the product. It does not fold down at all which makes it hard to pack for trips etc... I am very dissappointed in this product and Razor company should get a great big slap for false advertising. The advertisment also does not state the weight capacity, its say both kids and adults can enjoy this product. The weight capacity is only 175lbs. It does not come with an owners manual, and there is no tool case. The allen wrenches come in a plastic baggie taped with scotch tape. Very Very disappointed."
25969,-1,Boring plot.,"I liked what it was about, the characters and alot of the ideas. What I didn't like was the plot, it just bored me. The only reason I kept reading was to see if it had anymore ideas in it, I love his ideas, especially in books like Mort, Colour of Magic, and Light Fantastic."
25975,-1,On second thought,"I left a review criticizing GrapeVine for not putting the fact that this is a DVD-R. On second thought and second viewing I believe that though the DVD-R format SHOULD be mentioned in the product description, this is probably the only way that rare films that can never hope to see commercial release can be made available. The print is not great, but I've seen worse and been able to enjoy the film. So sorry GrapeVine."
25976,-1,Not SYNC with the spirit of Amy Grant,"All the songs give you that ""uh, yep,,,right,,,ok"". If ya face facts,,,,Amy is due out for a ""Best of"" to make up for the really BAD songs lately she has produced that were not hits. Remember Journey's off songs,,,,,simuliar here with Amy Grants,,,,,,I have owned her entire collection to date and ""Heart of Motion"" CD is SO vastly superior to the rest of her CD's. I have loved the ""Angels"" song on the ""Straight Ahead"" Album for instance but not much else. You will not find this spirited type song on this album. She lost it"
25977,-1,Try something else.,"I picked up this book at B&N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much, much shorter and the ending made a little longer.I liked the character of Mr. Bounderby. He was very well developed. I would even say over-developed, but he was the only one. How did Sissy influence the youngest Gradgrind? Why didn't we know of Mrs. Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father? Every character had something missing. What happened to Mr. Bounderby once he was found out? Why is Sissy so special and what did she really do for the family?It was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended I felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters. The story line could have been forgiven if I was more satisfied with the characters."
25978,-1,Hard Times,"I picked up Hard Times preparing to enjoy it since Charles Dickens is my favorite author. While not going so far to say that I was disappointed,I will say that it was the first Charles Dickens novel that I almost felt like not finishing. Not only is the plot rather humorless, but the characters are charmless and almost uninteresting. If it hadnt been written by Dickens then I may have liked it better but as it was it did not have any of Dickens usual charm and humor."
25979,-1,A Horrible Mess of Incoherent Words,"This book was terrible! Half the characters did not have an ending and no main character is apparent. Then again, I'm a freshman in high school and may be a little inexperienced to judge so harshly. I personally dislike Dicken's wordy style of writing because it's easy to get lost. If you like Dickens, and you don't mind his writing style I'm sure you would probably disagree with me. I'll give it a two."
25980,-1,Death by verbosity,Charles Dickens did for the art of literature what the 80's did for music: Made it intolerable and robbed it of any beauty. The Dicken's aesthetic of excessive description drives the reader to tedium and makes him wish that Dicken's was payed for every word he saved instead of every one he wrote. His knack for wrapping up loose ends in a nice neat conclusion is overshadowed by the time and effort it takes to reach that point
25981,-1,Underwhelmed,"This is not Dickens at his best. No offence to the narrator, who does a good job but I think the story itself is rather boring. Especially when compared with his classics ""Great Expectations"", ""A Christms Carol"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities""."
25984,-1,I expected more.....,"The 2 stars goes to Timothy Hutton for his great performance, truly an outstanding actor! But... the movie... well not so great. I was left somewhat disappointed. It starts well and gives you the impression of a good movie but then it evolves into a bizarre scenario that completely fails to keep up the suspenseful tone of the start, and is in fact rather wearisome and inconclusive at times. It's as if they are trying really hard to achieve a goal with a poor script... I expected more that's all..."
25988,-1,Uninspired,"Gee, I wasn't as impressed as you guys. I found it quite tedious. Bram Stoker's original is one of a kind. This is not even remotely in the same league. Sorry."
25994,-1,Old information,"Unfortunately, I did not like this book. I found it difficult to read and boring, even though it was recommended by a friend.."
26013,-1,Not my favorite,"I found Man of La Mancha to be quite confussing. The plot is so crazy that it is hard to get a grasp on what is happening until halfway through the book. One you do figure it out, it is rather humerous, but not one of my favorites by any means."
26015,-1,A tresured noir given poor picture quality by KINO,"The movie is a masterpiece of noir with performances that are superb. However, the grainy gooey VHS-like picture quality can only be attributed to a very poor and shoddy transfer by KINO."
26018,-1,Disappoitment,"It was first FW album I've listened to. And I'm afraid I'll never buy their CDs again. I don't want to waste my money. Well, I've heard FW is one of the prog metal monsters. Perhaps... Dream Theatre, for instance, doesn't have any such a pale album. This album has just some elements of progressive. If I have not heard it's prog rock group I'd never supposed it's progressive. Ok, the CD now is in used CD department and I hope I'll return some money."
26024,-1,Slow and pointless,"Great idea--strange reactions to art--is tossed aside and scene after scene is set up yet goes nowhere. (Why does she return home? Why does she have to be a cop? She never shows up at the station!) Poorly edited with transitions so bad, title cards were added so you know where you are -- Rome, etc. Interesting conclusion, yet really, it's a mess so skip it."
26043,-1,Clan of the Cave Bear,"This book was interesting with great promise. The premise was fascinating but the writer fought with herself throughout. She spent a great deal of time on the flora and the fauna. There was always a paragraph on a bush when a sentence would do, a sentence on a tree when a word would suffice. The characters were well developed. Over all it was a good read."
26045,-1,Kindle's edition is full of typos,The kindle editions of these books are chock full of typographical errors that sometimes make it difficult to figure out what should have been written. The typos made me feel like I'd been gyped on the price of the books.
26046,-1,"Tries hard, but stereotyped and inaccurate.","Extremely well-written, good plot, characters and Mrs. Auel has done some research. Now here's the bad part. It is anthropologically inaccurate. Mrs. Auel does a beautifully stereotyped depiction of the Neanderthals as stooped, muzzle-jawed, intellectually inferior creatures as compared to wonderful Cro-Magnon people with their tall erect graceful carriage, blue eyes and blond hair. I mentioned this book to my anthropology professor and he said, very succintly, ""Burn it!&quot"
26062,-1,"Stoner Rock, I think not!","First of all, don't even bother mentioning Sixty Watt Shaman in the same sentence as Alice and Chains and Soundgarden. Cantrell has more talent in his pinky than Sixty Watt has all together. If you want to check out real Stoner Rock, Kyuss and Queens of The Stone Age are a good start. This album is mediocre at best. Red Colony seems to be the only song I could really get into. Cool album cover though! Maryland must have a really lame Stoner Rock scene, because out here in CA, Sixty Watt Shaman would go unnoticed."
26069,-1,Ho Hum Effort,"Fair representation of what could have been a great "" dog fight"" movie.The movie should have been edited down to less than 2 hours withoutalot of the frivolities that occur on the ground. You could still buildenough out of the characters to make them interesting without the prolonged love story. The action in the air is decent."
26071,-1,"Well Done Aerial Combat Sequences, Little Else","This is one of those films where more emphasis was placed on the aerial dogfight sequences -- little or no thought went into the plot or acting.What a lame excuse for a movie. My biggest complaint of this movie is that it's so cliche you could cut it with a knife. The role of Texan Blaine Rawlings, who flits off at a moments notice to be with his new love, is beyond belief or plausability. The rest of the acting ensemble, other than Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno), were window dressing in this piece of movie dribble. And the dreaded German Ace was hardly more than a voyeur who wanted to savor his victory by the sight of his victim's face before they died.Lame plot, poor acting, dubious historical accuracy, wrapped around some nice dogfight sequences. What a shame, as I had hoped for better than this.Don't buy this turkey. Save your money and get ""Dogfight"" -- more accurate, exciting, and historically true."
26085,-1,uhmmm,I forgotten how much inappropriate language was in this one. I unfortunately started this with my kids...Won't make that mistake again. Next time I'll check pluggedin even if I watched it before.
26089,-1,An example of silly science fiction,"Miss Pickerell is a spinster with a cow, a love of rocks and a very old car. The story opens with her taking her nieces and nephews to the fair and exhibiting her rock collection. There she meets Mr. Haggerty and gives him a ride. It turns out that Mr. Haggerty is to be the navigator on a space flight to Mars and the ship is currently parked in Miss Pickerell's pasture. This upsets Miss Pickerell, but her curiosity overwhelms her and in a major mistake, she replaces Mr. Haggerty on the flight to Mars.This story is generally silly science fiction; the crew demonstrates incompetence to the point where Miss Pickerell has to come to their rescue. I read this book for the first time when I was in elementary school and even then found it laughable. There are many books for the young person far superior in their descriptions of space flight."
26095,-1,This one's a loser,"Maggie Shayne can certainly write, but this one is a loser. It was difficult to warm up to the hero and heroine - Edie, a former lingerie model is cold and colorless, she returns to her home town and buys up the property that Wade has always wanted because he ticked her off. This is neither adult nor endearing. He, on the other hand, is your typical alpha male who, in this case 'jerks' off while looking at her layouts in lingerie. Not an attractive trait either. These two people are just not likeable and Edie is so dumb, it's scarey - while she's being stalked, she buys an isolated piece of property. The scene where her sister is being tortured is far too explicit for a category romance and more appropriate to a mainstream thriller. The rest of Edie's family were far more interesting than the main characters. Overall, disappointing and not nice."
26105,-1,Not happy. Read the book. Much better.,"Very disappointed by this movie. The book was great and so I anticipated the movie would be as well, especially after seeing who was going to star in the movie.Very disappointed. Slow moving movie - lots missing..."
26110,-1,All About Lene,"After reading Into Thin Air, I have read everything I could get my hands on regarding the 96 Everest tragedy. I have turned into an ""Armchair Everest Junkie"". Lene's perspective on her survival was of particular interest to me because I am such a chicken when it comes to taking risks. This book was more about who Lene liked and who she thought little of. There was very little credible information that shed light on what she went through. I found it distasteful that she took shots at those whom she accompanied and collectively staked their lives on the bid for the Everest summit. True, Anatoli was a fine mountaineer and human being but he was the only other person she respected. That pretty much sums up the book!"
26115,-1,Season Three Lacking,"Though it started out strongly, Season 3 of CSI quickly falls to the wayside. Episodes like 'The Accused is Entitled' show the strength of this show, but the middle of the season is weak compared to previous seasons. The episodes are tired and formulaic, and the ""surprise"" season finale is laughable. Continuity is thrown out the window and the storylines are fractured. Buy the first and second seasons to see the best of CSI."
26116,-1,not bad for a cheap knife!,"cheap, light weight, quite flexible, doesn't hold a sharp edge very well- but what do you expect from a cheap knife? I bought it because I liked the shape!Use it, abuse it then throw it away or sell at your next ""I'll never do it again"" garage sale."
26120,-1,"Great book, bad product","The story contained in this book is excellent, but the book itself is junk. It appears that is was visually scanned from and older and more narrowly formatted print and then pasted into this print with little to no error checking. The worst result of this is that every word that was hyphenated across two lines in the original text appears broken and hyphenated even though it is now in the middle of a line (e.g. hyphen- ated). You will also see occasional misreads such as a number 1 in place of a lowercase ""L"".Find another printing."
26123,-1,not happy,"great concept, however, tuning is imposable, you get some horizontal instability 98% of the time. but when you get it, it looks decent!"
26129,-1,A little too slow,"I found 1984 to be an intriguing book. The plot of the book was interesting. How the author went about telling the story was too slow for me. I found it hard to pay attention while reading it. Throughout the entire book there were bits of intereseting parts followed by several paragraphs of, what i found to be, random information. I though it was a great plot but the storyline wasn't to my liking."
26130,-1,"thing plot, boring read","Having grown up in the former Soviet Union, as soon as I started reading the book, I could tell immediately where Orwell drew his inspiration, as well as most details of peoples' existence. Reading the book was like re-visiting my childhood, as well as refreshing my mother's and grandmother's stories of the soviet life in the 1950's, all the brainwashings, terrible living conditions, propaganda, people disappearing in the middle of the night, etc. Basically, Orwell took soviet reality of that era, and then took it a few notches up, and then twisted it some. Art imitates life, so to speak. I'm not sure why everyone credits Orwell's imagination, then. Either way, the book is extremely boring, the plot is almost non-existent, nothing is really going on, the [unlikely] love affair took half-the book to unfold, and it wasn't even worth it."
26134,-1,An unrealistic book that dosen't make sense,"I think that this book is a bad book. Not only is it unrealistic, but also a boring book. Orwell has an imaginative mind, I must say, but thuis book talks about 1949, when he published it when there were such things as totalitarism. How could he know it would still be the exact same thing in 1984? This book also has strange events. The author skipped around too many times. At one sentence, he would be in the appartment in Winston's home, and without telling a reason for it, he would be some where else. The book is also boring. There is not enough action and suspense to make the reader willing to read it."
26146,-1,Boring and depressingly morbid at the same time...,"OK, maybe Mr. Orwell intended it to be this way, but it still doesn't hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the author's other works. I read this book because I remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding Animal Farm years ago, and this work was recommended by several of my friends. If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing, check this out. Yes, this is science fiction, and just because some people call it a classic doesn't mean I like it. If you want some of the best in this genre, I recommend 'Dune', by Frank Herbert, '2001: A Space Odyssey', by Arthur C. Clarke, or 'Enders Game', by Orson Scott Card."
26153,-1,Wait for a Better Release,"As someone that bought the first season of The Bob Newhart Show, I must say I was disappointed in the poor quality. I mean that while other series have character pictures and are one sided DVDs this set was two sided. There are still some channels broadcasting the series and even though they are the cut-up syndicated version, it was better than what I bought. Wait for someone responsible like Shout Factory to do it right.Try Hulu, it may be there."
26161,-1,Quite funny,"Deadly accurate too, especially the mother stuff. Incredible performances, but I'd rather curl up with the cat and watch 'Roman Holiday'. Life's too short to roll around in the John."
26164,-1,Need to proof read your work,This book could be useful if the examples actually worked. I have barely reached the 50th page and all ready I have found more errors than should be allowed in an entire book. The examples are mis-quoted and several don't work. The book might be more helpful if the proof reader knew enough on the subject to correct the more obvious errors. If you buy this book be ready to experiment with the syntax which may be close but not always correct.
26172,-1,Not what I expected,"This wasn't at all what I expected. Once I was done I understand what Anne was trying to do but while reading the book I was wondering what she was doing.It's not a bad book, just not what I expected.She spends lots of time spouting about why people become masochists. To be honest I wanted more of what went on in the club - not why they were there."
26179,-1,Not a fan of these,"I've tried all 3 Zoe Bars. (Are there more..?) My personal favorite is the chocolate-peanut butter one. I've purchased 4 boxes in the last few months of that flavor and love them as a between meal snack. They are the only thing I've found that can replace sweets for me and with no guilt after eating.BUT...The chocolate ones are not good tasting nor is it a good texture. Too dense, too strange, odd chocolate similarity but not really chocolate and bad aftertaste. Even worse, however, are the peanut butter ones. I gave those away. At least I'll most likely eat these eventually."
26180,-1,Didn't like them,"The first thing I noticed about these is they are very dense, with a very waxy but dry and gritty texture. And there really is only a slight chocolate flavor, with a strange aftertaste. They are filling though, but then again so is eating compressed cardboard!"
26185,-1,This book is hard to understand,"This book is hard for me to understand because most sentences doesn't make sense. Some does make sense but most of them no. Ray Bradbury should do more better then that. I've being forced to read this book because my 9th grade english teacher made us. When I start reading this book it is okey. When I'm on page 30 the sentence doesn't make sense. It just mostly say ""I burn bookee"". I would rather read Great Expectations instead. If you are a very good reader you may try it."
26187,-1,takes a wrong turn,"fahrenheit 451 starts off well, but definately doesnt end that way. besides the fact the some characters seem unreal and are impossible to relate to, at one point in the book montag and his friend have an incredibly insightful talk and end it in an idiotic plan, but i won't go into that too much. the end is boring and close to impossible to get through. read it, but be prepared."
26188,-1,Skip 451,"Basically, Fahrenheit 451 is a let down. The drop off ending cuts off the futuristic plot's potential. There is much colorful vocabulary, but some metaphors are so elaborate and sudden that one hardly knows whether something is actually happening or if it's just a figment of the character's imagination. It is more confusing that challenging to read. The main character, Montag, has a fairly interesting conflict. The only problem is that it is not resolved enough by the end of the book to leave the reader satisfied! Plus, the only moral or meaning from the book is given away early on, leaving nothing to motivate the reader. I recommend this book to nobody, because they will be disappointed."
26189,-1,Very SLLLOOoowwww...ZZzzz,"This book could have easily been summed up in 30 pages! Not that I don't love attention to detail in stories, because I do, but F. 451 just dragged. It was a great concept and good plot but there was certain scenes where Bradbury overevaluated and overexplained everything! I'm never touching this book again."
26190,-1,NOT THAT GOOD,Fahrenheit 451 was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover. This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader.
26194,-1,"Story good, reading is abysmal! Don't do it!!","I have Always preferred to hear an author read their own works because only they really know what was intended--until now. Mr. Bradbury has one tone and one tone only and that is carried out with a mush-mouth. It's just horrendous and painful to listen to. Go find another copy--trust me (I would quit but I'm trying to finish it for a book club). Mercifully @ 5 CDs it's pretty short.Amendment: So after finishing, I must say that the last CD is just an interview with the author and it's really very interesting. If you'd like to hear him talk about his life, the books genesis, etc., skip to the last CD. I did enjoy that and it's almost like a different person speaking. He's so much more gregarious when just talking."
26205,-1,The book shows a bleak vision of the future of the world,"The book although very confusing , as the author uses too much detail , was intruiging . One of the things that didn't make sense was the reason for the character of clarisse mclellan's dissapearance. The ending of the book is too sudden , as if he rushed to complete the book ."
26214,-1,Fahrenheit 451 - Not worth it,"This book is boring. Unless you are interested in science fiction or Ray Bradbury's work you probably wont like it. This book takes place in the future in a world where all books are banned. People spend a lot of time watching television. Montag, the main character is a firefighter who burns books. The story of the book is ok but it gets boring and there is no excitement. The book is easy to read and there isn't any very hard vocabulary. Don't read this book if you are in fourth grade or younger because it might be to hard to read, just stick to the movie if you are interested in this topic."
26215,-1,451 review by Jessica C.,"when i read Farenheit 451, my first impression was that this book is so screwed up. i mean like who would want to not read a book. thats just so wrong. the one thing i did like about the book was Guy's wife, Mildred. i liked her alot because she said that the t.v was her family. she was a little crazy though. i also liked the part where she called the firemen and told them that Guy had books. then she walked out on him. i also liked the mechanical dog. that was something very original. i gave the book 2 stars because i really thought that it was a waste of time to read it. but you know, that is only my impression of the book.Writen By:Jessica C."
26216,-1,Fahrenheit 451- Somewhat a flop,"I didn't really care for this book. Fahrenheit 451 is not far-fetched though. I think some of the material mentioned in this book really could happen in the future if we let it. This is a fairly good book overall, but I'm rating it a 2 out of 5 stars because I was just confused. I am a freshmen in high school and my whole Literature Pre-AP class had to read Fahrenheit 451 for an assignment. Now I know what you're probably thinking, well of course it's going to be confusing for a freshmen. But, I beg to differ. This book is written good I suppose, but the story jumps around too much and certain parts come up and it is just plain confusing (i.e. Dentham's Dentifrice). Well that is about all I have to say about this novel. I'm sure if I read it over again I would enjoy it more. But I don't think this book would be much more than 2 or 3 stars."
26222,-1,it was okay,"I had to read this book for school, and at first I hated it. The beginning chapter is hard to understand because of all the symbolism, however, it eventually gets better. (slowly) It is easy to miss some concepts if you don't read slowly enough. I felt that the ending was far-fetched and boring. I did enjoy reading about a dystopian society, but altogether, the book is tedious and slow-moving."
26230,-1,A bit on the dull side,"Bradbury has set forth some interesting ideas and prophecies in this book but as far as entertaining and suspensful goes I would give it about an ""F"" grade. It squeeks two stars."
26235,-1,Great Value for the Money,"I bought this charger for only a couple of bucks and it works like a charm. I don't expect it last forever so i purchased a couple of back-ups just in case. Each one of these Adapters failed after a couple months use, even light use. I would skip this one and seek another way to charge such as an using an inverter and home plug in charger. This year I switched to an iPhone."
26238,-1,A somewhat annoying companion,"This book may be of value to someone who really knows Virgil and Virgilian scholarship, but Horsfall's style is so idiosyncratic, and his approach so random, that students and other intermediate readers are best warned off. Ideas are presented, or hinted at, in sentences or sentence fragments overflowing with parentheses, exclamation points, question marks, footnotes, and cross-references. The text is poorly edited and in places doesn't make any sense at all. Overall, one gets the impression that Horsfall (who wrote most of the book, and translated two chapters from Italian into his own idiom) is a brilliant scholar who welcomes us into his brain but really can't be bothered tidying up before we come in."
26245,-1,The Adoption theme is problematic,"Adoptive parents should be aware of the problematic aspects of this movie for kids who were adopted. When Stuart's biological parents arrive on the scene and announce that they want Stuart back, his adoptive parents hand him over, no questions asked. There is no sense that adoption is permanent. If your adopted child sees this movie, be prepared to discuss it afterwards and assure your child this would never happen in real life."
26262,-1,Finnegans Wake Me Up,"One wonders how many of the positive (4 or 5 stars) reviewers here are either (1) intellectual poseurs who say they've read the book cover to cover but actually haven't read more than a little; or (2) if they have read it in its entirety, whether they have too much spare time on their hands.One thing it is not (contrary to what some pretentious reviewers here would have you believe) is a ""fun read"" or ""page turner"".Despite some glittering word play and demonstrations of great scholarship, Finnegan's wake is a hulking mess."
26266,-1,Less than impressed. Weak compared to his other works.,"While Joyce's Ulysses demonstrates his monstrous success with literary experimentation styles, FW does not. I find it poor by his standards. In academics (and among pseudo-intellectuals) the book is quite fashionable, and understably so - the style is unique. Its almost comical to listen to my fellow Joyce fans rave about it. But whenever I corner them, and beg them to dissect the work for me, the responses are as incoherent as the book itself. Perhaps it inspires creative thinking/translation from its readers, but nothing of the sort on my part, despite my repeated efforts to sincerely read it.I've read far worse, that's for sure, but someone thinking of dabbling with Joyce for the first time should seriously consider selecting one of his more substantial earlier works, or the frustration with FW may alienate them forever from an otherwise brilliant and often very powerful author."
26267,-1,Houston...we have a problem,"I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world."
26270,-1,Disappointing . . .,"I had read 5 or more rave reviews about this book and was excited to receive it. After reading it, I am sorry to say that it was not life changing, inspiring or even a good read. The book seems so childish to me. Maybe because I am 50 and the author is 29. Maybe the lessons she is trying to pass on I have learned a long time ago. Things like it's not O.K. to tease or take advantage of another person. . . Just disappointing. Maybe it is a good read for someone who hasn't done a great deal of living yet."
26272,-1,"Doesn't block the heat much, flimsy mouse pad","Unlike other reviews here, for me the lapinator and mousepad didn't work so well. Used it with a Toshiba Satellite laptop and optical mouse. After about 2 hours, the lapinator was almost HOT to the touch, laptop fan did not run less, laptop itself did not feel cool to the touch. Had better luck with other coolant systems. Maybe Toshibas run hotter than other laptops, so it could be a matter of that particular laptop not being well-suited for the lapinator. I run my new HP Pavillion right on my desk's surface, with no resulting overwarming of the laptop or the desk surface. Possibly, this particular cooling pad works optimally with only certain laptops."
26278,-1,Disappointing,"At first, I was happy with the product because my dog wasn't pulling nearly as hard as before. But then I noticed that the side strap pushes up into her eye, making it water and become irritated, when we walk. I tried fixing the problem but nothing worked, it kept going into her eye. The product was definitely a waste of money."
26285,-1,"Borrow, don't buy!","A very predictable thrown-together movie to make a few more bucks from an otherwise outstanding series. Better than ""Ark of Truth"",but not much."
26300,-1,Mr.Average,"and that is a reach.this Album has Easily His Best Music to date on it but the Cat can't Sing to Me&nothing every seems to change.now He is One Lucky Cat with all the Tribute Shows&Projects He gets to be down with.but as far as Being an Elite Artist?Don't Believe the Hype.thsi Album He is trying to tap into R.Kelly,D'angelo&Maxwell's World&Come up way short."
26305,-1,"Industrial, though not ""Professional""","I too bought this disc because Ray McVeigh is the guitarist. His playing on the Professionals ""I Didn't See It Coming"" record is incredible. The guitar tandem of Ray and Steve Jones (sex pistOls) on that record was, as far as I'm concerned, the punk equivalent of Keith Richards and Ron Wood. Tasteful, catchy, weaving guitar lines that are stuck in my head forever.There is none of that here. Like many industrial records, everything is so sludged in effects, you can't make out any style at all. There are also appearances by a few other artists I dig, but the same problem exists there.If you need another industrial record, this is better than Filter, or any of that nonsense, but it's nothing that's going to change your life."
26307,-1,What a disappointment,"My 16 year old daughter told me this film changed her life. I'm getting her into therapy soon. I suppose that as a study in film making techniques and creativity this film breaks some novel ground. Aside from that the characters held no interest for me, a 47 year old. The overdone running scenes comprise about 50% of what is a rather short-running film to begin with. Decent Dolby 5.1 effects. Look for something else!"
26311,-1,"Tried to like it, but bad music ruined it.","It was kind of an interesting film, but I found the music boring and monotonous. Some of you have good points about the technical merits and originality, but I just could not get past the music, so for me it was not enjoyable. If the director and producer both had tin ears, there are millions of cheap, underpaid musicians in the world. Or just leave some of the more obnoxious music out.Germany/Austria has given so much great music to the world: Mahler, Brahms, Schumann, Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, Handel, Bach, to name a few. It's a shame that this movie from Germany could not do better.The characters were difficult to identify with. Maybe that was intentional. It was difficult for me to understand why Lola cared about her worthless boyfriend.I have never rated a movie this low before, but there are some worse films than this. It would have been a decent movie if they had taken the care not to ruin it."
26312,-1,Ich weiß ja nicht !,"Also ich finde es ja toll, dass ein deutscher Film in den USA so gut ankommt, aber ich habe ihn bei uns in Deutschland im Kino gesehen und dachte mir ""wie lange rennt die denn noch"" und ""warum rennt die schon wieder"". Mein Freundin fand den Film aber echt klasse. Von den vier Leuten die wir waren gibt einer 5 Sterne, 2 geben drei Sterne und ich gebe dem Film 2 Sterne. Würde ihn mir aber niemals auf DVD oder Video kaufen."
26315,-1,"""Different"" kind of movie!","I bought the dvd of this movie after I read all those positive feedback from other viewers. However, this is not the type of movie that I'll be willing to wait for more than a month for viewing. As an overseas buyer,the movie, shipment waiting time, and the cost of buying it all doesn't meet my high expectation/anticipation level of the movie. I was expecting something more like ""Le femme Nikita"" not a story of 2 youngsters having three different ending of their problems. The only good thing from this movie, for me, is the music! Two thumbs up for the music selection..."
26327,-1,Tuner doesn't work well after 1 yr.,I purchased aiw 7500 aprox. 1yr. ago. I thought it was a decent card when I bought it at that point would have given it a 4star rating. Within three months the card started freezing my machine while using DVR. Then more reciently the video with the tuner started flashing bright than dark. It happens all the time making the tuner unusable. I have found no resolution to my problems from ati. I'm not angry just unsatisfied.
26333,-1,A disappointment,"Altman has moments. Early in his career, these moments came often: ""M*A*S*H"" and ""The Long Goodbye,"" ""Nashville"" and ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller."" But he also had disasters and disappointments. This lackluster, tedious picture belongs in the latter folder. There is an utter lack of narrative momentum, Carradine and Duvall are a real bore, and the use of radio bits fails to add much. No one needs to see this movie."
26341,-1,Biz JETS meaning jets with some piston aircraft in between,"When I bought this book I was hoping on getting a book covering only small jets! But what I got was a book including a lot of piston aircraft and a few airliners along with the biz JETS. Piston engine isn't a jet engine! Some informations that I would like to know on these ""jets"" are not there e.g. cruising alt. But the book has it's good sides to! The recognition part is very neat and I the thing that gives this book those two stars!"
26357,-1,The Audience Laughed the Whole Way Through...,"It was funny, bad acting, stupid scripts and over the top special effects! There was nothing else to do but to laugh at how stupid it was. This movie good be 1 hour shorter if it wasn't for all the repeated scences of just looking at the house from the outside. And no, Catherine Zeta Jones didn't save the movie."
26358,-1,This is not a horror movie.,"This is not a horror movie- it is an interesting science fiction movie. However, it is a science fiction movie with bad special effects and a bad dialogue. The acting is good, but that just doesn't make up for it. I didn't buy this movie- I went to see it once in the theatre, and that was enough for me. If you want a real horror movie, check out The Sixth Sense."
26359,-1,Expected More,"I thought this movie would be something more, but the teaser trailer was far better than the movie! I understood that it wasn't a jump out horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller thing, and still, no good. Maybe the only thing good in it was Catherine Zeta-Jones that neat merry-go-round / mirror room, and the special effects.. I also found the other characters in the movie quiet boring, and the plot confused me until the third time I watched it. But if you like slow-paced movies that eventually end, then this is for you."
26375,-1,APCIKJC by White,"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a Catholic vs. Fundamentalist Christians story. Michael, the main character who went from Philadelphia to Kentucky, defended Catholic views and procedures. He tried to explain new ideas to the Fundamentalist, but they where not open to these ideas. I personally felt it became better towards the end of the novel. At first it was slow-moving and hard to keep track of all the characters. The description became hackneyed, along with the plot. Also, reading about the farm life was hard to relate to. After the heated bible discussions began, the story was easier to read. Overall, this book was better than I had expected."
26379,-1,too small for a newborn,I ordered this bag without any knowledge of how big it was. I wanted to use it for a wkend trip I was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was. I have a 3 month old baby girl and it was way too small for me to carry all of her things in it. I was only able to fit a few diapers and wipes and the other small items. I wasn't even able to fit a change of clothes. I tried putting a change of her clothes in the back pocket but it made it way too bulky. All in all the bag was adorable but way too small for a newborn. I wouldn't recommend this bag to any mother with a newborn baby.
26385,-1,Few Errors,"If you read a ""Dummies"" book before then you know the format. The first part of the book is divided into lessons, then there are three sample tests in the back.I thought the lessons were good, but not great compared to some of the other ASVAB books out there. The book did a great job of telling you upcoming changes to the ASVAB as advertised.What really turned me off from this book was when I was doing the sample tests and there were a couple answers that were clearly wrong. For instance, the question for General Science was what Chromosomes does a female have. The answers in the back said ""XY"" while it should have been ""XX"". This was just one of a few I found.While the style remains the same as most dummies books, I cant recommend this to anyone based on the errors in the sample tests. If you dont plan on doing sample tests then this book might be for you."
26390,-1,zero durability,"the felt top is so thin, my dog tore into it instantly! Next came out the foam bed, which she shredded into a million pieces, then she got to the inner cedar beds. Well you can imagine the mess it made.this bed lasted her a whole week. I cannot find anything for her. If you have an older, mellow dog, this would be a great bed. It is quite comfortable. But if you have a pooch that likes to destroy, this won't hole up at all."
26398,-1,What's all the fuss about?I had to force myself to finish it,"This is just a warning to those of you who think you may have found a new, great author to read: forget it. I completely disagree that this is one of the best books of all time; the book was boring, and its characters were difficult to keep straight due to the author's annoying decision to name them all similarly."
26399,-1,What's the fuss all about?,"I was cajoled into reading this ""required reading for all of humanity"" masterpiece. I had to fight to finish this novel - I thought that at the very least, it would be as magical as Allende's House of Spirits, but I was severely disappointed. Unlike everyone else (or so it seems everyone else), this book did not change my sensibilities. The best part of the book was the last 40 or so pages, which ALMOST, almost, made the other 400 pages worthwhile. I do not doubt Garcia Marquez' talent -- what I do believe is a lot was lost in the translation!"
26401,-1,Middle of the Road,"My experience with 100 Years of Solitude has been that people either love it or they absolutely hate it, but I'm apathetic about it. I had to read it for a world cultures class in college and not even the teacher could tell us how it was relevant to what the class was about. The repetition of the men's names makes for a very confusing story line, and the son that was born with a tail? Weird, to say the least. But apparently this book inspires a lot of people judging by the previous reviews. I would suggest that you read it if for no other reason than to form your own opinion about it."
26418,-1,One of the few books I have stopped reading,"I even finished Brothers Karamazov and Bleak House, but this one I quit. I felt like I was wasting my time trying to remember the characters and their relations and what in the world is occuring in this make believe town of Macondo. Marquez may be a skilled writer and storyteller, but this book confused, bored and frustrated me without offering entertainment or insight.So what if Oprah picked it and if it has been labled a classic...it is not enjoyable or remarkable to me. I think I made it to about page 150 or so.With so many books to read, why waste time trying to decipher this one?"
26419,-1,"Great Discussion Book, Bad Airplane Book","I think that Mr. Marquez is a far superior story teller than he is a writer. It is too bad you can't sit around a fire listening to his stories instead. This book basically has no overall plot, but many smaller plots for each little story within it. I thought the sheer number of characters who names were similar (if not the same) was very annoying. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters due to the weaving in and out of other characters. I know that there was a family tree in the beginning, but I just got tired of flipping back to the point that I just did not care.To the average reader, without a discussion group or a literary expert, many of the ""hidden gems"" will be missed if there are any. On the whole, I just couldn't shake the vibe that I was reading an extended version of the Old Man and the Sea.It was interesting from the point of reading a Mexican writer."
26434,-1,And the point is?,"The book jumps all over the place, and the point is? Magical? I suppose so. Depressing? Oh yeah. Why does Oprah pick one depressing book after another?"
26435,-1,A book that left me indifferent,"This was my second try after 30 years to read this book. First time I abandoned after some 20-25 pages, this time I got as far as page 150.And I got this far because I thought that maybe I'm missing something, it can't be that so many people praise this book and I am the only one who doesn't like it. But after 150 pages and three generations of Aureliano and Accadio, in which almost anything happens, in which you hear love stories and war stories and fantastic stories and so on,suddenly I didn't feel curious what's next.First time I abandoned this book because the magic realism wasn't my cup of tea at that time. This time I quit because the book wasn't catching me , didn't make me feel any emotions about the characters, didn't make me curious about their fate.Someone said about this book that you either love it or hate it, well, to be honest, it left me indifferent.In another 30 years I'll give it another try and I will let you know if my perspective changed..."
26444,-1,"Futuristic sound effects, no steady beat","This is not an album to dance to, nor is it one to work-out to. There is no steady beat/musical-rhyme to this album (except for Papua New Guinea, which is the saving grace of this album in my opinion). I can't seem to fit this music to any mood, so unfortunately I have to rate it down."
26445,-1,Helpful ? Not so much,"Myself being a second (father's side)and third generation (mother's side)Swedish-American, I find the suggested pronunciations to be inaccurate. Some of the sounds described in this book are not as my parents tried to teach me.Disappointed in Dallas."
26450,-1,For Simpsons fans.,"If you like the television series ""The Simpsons,"" you will probably like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. They reflect the same vulgar approach to entertainment which, instead of making us rise above the gutter of everyday life, brings us to the lowest level of crudity. There are some redeeming tales however, such as the Knight's Tale, but as a whole, this book should be avoided by anyone with a sense of honour and decency."
26451,-1,transliteration makes lao even more complex than it is,"The Lonely Planet phrasebooks are usually a great help travelling around the world. This one however turned out to be creating more problems than solving them. The transliteration is so weird that you actually have to learn two new languages before pronouncing anything closely right. I tried the book with several english speaking lao persons and lao speaking native english speakers while travelling around the country and all had problems with the transliteration. Nothing is like you would naturally pronounce it. For example who would say Khoj if you see Khawy?Helpful is the lao bit so you can point, in the end its how I got around. A pity, there are much better transliterations around."
26455,-1,The only reason I give it 2 stars is.......,"The fact that this book is about Titanic (well sort of anyway). This book is not a true work of history. The research is faulty, the words and thoughts of the various characters is bogus fiction. After being a student of Titanic history for almost 40 years, this is a book that I have dismissed lightly, very lightly. If you want to know Titanic and the disaster that befell her, this is not the book."
26461,-1,A selection---we need a complete set of all they did.,"The Searchers are still touring and I saw them last year in Bay Shore, new York state. This album here is fine, BUT the group's work is much more worth getting INTO. We need the biggest most complete set possible. It is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs: The World is Waiting for Tomorrow, Lovers Will, All a Dream, Till I Met You, and so many more. Buy this if it's the best in your price range and then join the groups on the web where you can expand your Searchers appreciation! And don't forget to read Frank Allen's memoir of the group's history. It's fun!"
26464,-1,pure formula junk,"This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. It is such silly schlock that I marvel at how the Hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money - it's really an industrial production process, geared to superficial viewers.This is one of the basic plots. THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk. Why do we keep watching this junk? A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.OK, here goes: beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows. Oh, and then succeeds on her own terms.Not recommended. Admittedly, the acting in not abysmal, but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist."
26470,-1,Iz love Tira but this is still abd,really boring dull cjhick flick that is awful. i lov u tira but this isn;'t a ggod movie. i didnt wantt o watch thers people at all. but i do want to go into this club.
26484,-1,Yoga For Sufers Review,"As far as yoga instructional DVDs go, this is not one I would recommend. Particularly if you are not familar with yoga already. The poses are not explained as well as in most not-for-surfers DVDs. Often times, you can not see the feet of the instructor, so you do not know how to place your feet unless you already know the pose. I think Peggy is probably a good instuctor, but this DVD isn't a good example. The best part of this DVD is the advert for Rochelle's surf camp, which includes a cameo appearance of Minnie Driver. I found this portion of the DVD to be inspiring. If you are looking for some instruction on yoga poses, this is not a good choice."
26486,-1,dont do it,"If you know anything about yoga, do not buy this cd. The only positive parts is the location and view of the waves. This is more a novelty than useful. Honestly who does yoga in a wetsuit at pipeline..Try Ali McGraw's Video for a great intermediate yoga tape."
26488,-1,no book key,"I purchased this book under the impression it had a book key for QUIA, required by my profesora.It didn't have any book key... so now i have to return it. And just buy the one from the bookstore, like I should have done from the beginning.Also UPS was a day late, and didn't leave the book as I requested by signing the ""LEAVE PACKAGE"" form left by the delivery man. I had to go pick it up myself because I'm never at home."
26492,-1,Ray Charles early years,I am very disappointed with this CD set. I hardly recognize the sound on many songs. My favorite is Georgia on My Mind. I never heard a rendition like the one in this set. It is terrible. I am sorry I made this purchase.
26494,-1,One of those addicting Xanth novels.,"Once you start reading Xanth novels, they become addicting. This one is not as addicting as some of the series"
26501,-1,"Started well, then...","turned into a totally different story. I liked the beginning, but closer to the ending i could not believe that was the same book. There were good ideas that were abandoned by the writer, and the characters acted stupid most of the time.I do not reccomend this book."
26507,-1,sloppy,"I get that they want a standard for fitness classes, but if you dance the techniques correctly it is a workout. But just to move quickly with poor form is crazy. The more precise the movements especially the figure 8 movements the more tone on gets. The hands are ""Sloppy"" and the arms are dead weight. Shoulders are not kept away from the ears correctly. I just think you are better off buying a technique dvd with a dancer of professional performance status and drill the sequences.I found the transitions, sequencing, foot patterns and overall energy ""Sloppy"""
26514,-1,It's great when it works,"I specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose. It was to be taken on a trip to visit with my 5 year old grandson. What fun! We laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns. Well, after less than a day the only tooth that would cause the jaws to snap was the center tooth. Not too much fun there. I feel I wasted my money."
26521,-1,Boring...,"the title says it all. My 2.5 yr old son was not that interested in the first place, completely stopped playing with it after 30 minutes. It now sits with a pile of toys collecting dust."
26525,-1,NOT the Crocodile Dentist you think you're getting. China replica.,"I'm very upset after receiving my ""Crocodile Dentist"" game. Once I got it out of the Amazon box, I realized right away that this was not the game made by Hasbro sold in the US. It's very obvious just from looking at the game box, which is cheap, says ""CrocoDileDentist"" on it, and is full of oddly-phrased sentences with typos, punctuation errors, and grammer mistakes. The toy does work, but it is VERY cheaply made. If I wanted this toy, I could have gone to alibaba.com and ordered one from China myself for 1.75. Instead I paid 11 dollars for the REAL toy, and got this one. As another reviewer said, it does have a ""used"" look about it right out of the package. Especially on the bottom of the toy. I am very disapointed. I've never had an experience like this on Amazon, and I've bought hundreds of items. This seller gives this sitea bad name."
26527,-1,"Don't Get Me Wrong, I Still Love Bowie","The fatal flaw of this video is not Bowie's performance (he is brilliant), but its inferior production quality. It appears to be a pathetically low-budget production, a pity considering that it was done by the same man, D.A. Pennebaker, who wonderfully documented Bob Dylan's 1965 British tour in ""Don't Look Back"" (1967). As it is, the sound quality of this Ziggy Stardust performance is quite poor, as if all the mics were positioned 250 yards away from the stage. Moreover, the camera work is at times annoyingly erratic and inappropriate. The whole production, strangely, reeks of amateurism. If this movie would have been made with, for example, the production quality of Led Zeppelin's ""The Song Remains the Same,"" it would be well worth watching. Unfortunately, the bizarre sight of Bowie himself in action is its only saving grace."
26529,-1,Color is not expresso!,We ordered the expresso - but the color is quite different. The lighter shade is greenish grey! and the darker in almost black. Will do better in a black/grey scheme rather than expresso scheme. - So upsetting!
26531,-1,Falls far short of expectations.,"The author in the preface says that he expects this book to be a complete reference for Tomcat. I would say that it falls far short of the objective.I had expected a meaningful look at Tomcat. Most of the information presented is already available with the standard Tomcat distribution. There is no attempt to go beyond the surface. It seems the author was in a rush to get a book published, rather than spend time providing some insight into Tomcat.There is no proper introduction to the terms or concepts related to Tomcat. I don't expect an introduction to servlets or JSP. All I ask for is clear concise definitions of the various Tomcat components and a breakdown of the config files.If you are intrested in finding more about Tomcat stick to looking for the information online. It will be time well spent."
26533,-1,This book could have been something special...,"It's a shame this book was so poorly written, and misleading in its title. The Java/Tomcat community has been struggling for some time with Tomcat, trying desperately to gain some sort of useful insight from the horrid online documentation. Then along comes this long-awaited manual that could have easily saved the day for thousands of sysadmins.Problem is, this book provides next to no useful information on the integration of Apache and Tomcat. It's bad enough that this information comes at nearly the end of the book. What's worse, the integration chapter is only a few pages long, and goes no further (in fact, doesn't even go as far) as the documentation that's provided online.This book is a huge disappointment - you are far better served by picking up a good O'Reilly book on servlets/JSP/etc. and figuring out the Tomcat installation/webapp deployment issues on your own."
26538,-1,Why?,"I often Buy having not seen a movie, especially when the reviews are glowing. Thankfully, I rented this first. I just don't see what was so special about this movie that was not family friendly, boring and drifted. My tastes go more for the movie that i can watch with my large family. This one doesn't qualify.Moreover, I don't see any of the usual devises that make you sit back and say, ""wow, well written"". I only rented this because of the academy award. I don't agree that it should have gotten the award over some of its worthy competitors.Rent it first as I did, maybe you'll agree with the professional reviews."
26548,-1,Material too flimsy,"I bought this bed recently for my 9 year old lab mix. He doesn't dig, chew or abuse things in any way, so I wasn't concerned with getting a super abuse-proof bed. But after a couple of weeks of limited use I found a hole in the soft side of the bed. The fact that this side attracts hair is unfortunate, but a hole being made almost immediately makes this bed not worth buying. It may have been a decent design if it was made with sturdy materials. Very disappointing."
26550,-1,"Great group, poor dvd",Dvd was dissapointing. It was not a 2007 concert as you could be lead to believe on the way the dvd is advertised.The dvd was released in 2007 but was of a 1982 concert. Parts of the sound track are not in sinc with the video.
26564,-1,Its all shell.,"This magazine has great covers and gets your attention right away. I was was drawn to the cover because it claims to have great article inside, but the articles are very short and pointless. It was a good magazine few years back but now it just seems like they don't know what their doing."
26579,-1,"Good overview of breads in the world, not a good recipe book","This book starts with the usual 'bread book' introduction--explaining different grains, various methods of making bread,equipment etc. Then half of the book is devoted on introducing breads in different regions of the world. The rest is bread recipes from each part of the world.The pictures are nice and gives us an idea of what bread is in Germany, in France, in Japan, in the middle east. However, when I tried a couple of the recipes, they all turned out below average--and I am experienced in bread-making. I would suggest people who want to 'bake' to look somewhere else, such as 'the village baker'"
26582,-1,Did Not Work For Me,"Not at all what I needed because it did not fit. I expected that it would be a general universal RV water heater drain valve wrench, but I was wrong I guess. I have a Minnie Winnegago, and have a water heater that is a very common one used. I wasted my money. I had alreay thrown away the package so now I can't return it. Wish I would have known it would not work. The product itself isn't bad quality, but I thought the title and description of this product was not accurate."
26584,-1,Should put his talent to better use....,"Larry Carlton is one fine guitarist, and fails to show off his talent in this latest release. The session musicians and far to prominent and mask out his playing. I would love to hear Larry Carlton solo, or with bass and drum only."
26589,-1,"Not one of Rinaldi's ""masterpiecies"", yet not so bad","Well, to be really honest with you, I didn't like this book. Personally, I though Ann Rinaldi could've done a little better. Some parts are interesting and maybe even suspensful, but the rest is kind of dull. At some points in the book, Emily, the main character, is lying so much to her Uncle Valentine and is being so selfish, it's like, ""okay, so when's she going to tell the truth or at least realize what she has done?"""
26595,-1,Not the best choice...,"Was received promptly, but the quality of the item is rather shoddy, barely lasted a week. Not the sellers fault but still to be noted."
26597,-1,Weak Signal,"I purchased this because of the good reviews.. but I didn't have a good experience. Putting the card in was easy enough... but once I got it in, the signal was 14% ... so I thought... ok.. we are 2 floors away... maybe it's not close enough. So I moved it to the room 10 feet away from the wireless router.. and I still only got 14% and it kept dropping connection. I messed with the settings for several hours and couldn't get any better connection. Uninstalled, returned to Amazon at their expense for a prompt refund.. and purchase the WRT54G. I get over 80% with that!"
26600,-1,"Works, but with limitations.","This PCI card is easy to install, and so is the software. The interface of the software is also good. However, the cable connecting the antenna and the card is too short, making it difficult and often impossible to find a good location for the antenna to have stable strong signal. This is especially true if the PC is located under a desk. The cable is too short for the antenna to reach the desk. My desk has metal legs, which may interfere with the wireless signals. I used this card for a year and was often irritated by the need for tweaking the position of antenna to get stable signal. Since PCs are not to be moved around, if possible, installing a network cable will be a far better solution than wireless. I finally bought an RJ45 crimper, connectors, and cat5e bulk cable (for about $80 total) to connect several rooms to my router. I wish I had done this at the beginning to save the money on this card."
26602,-1,"Lots of Basset photos, short on Basset specifics.","I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book."
26604,-1,ONLY FOR PROGRAMMER,I got this book for my programming class and I had no programming experience before. I hate this book! Maybe some people who have a little background would like it better.
26605,-1,Vague,"This is not a good Java book. It goes too fast over topics that should be covered in more depth, lacks examples, mentions concepts never explained before, and the teaching style is horrible. If you want a thorough introduction to Java, with plenty of examples, and a well-organized method of teaching, do not buy this book, instead get ""Beginning Java 2"" by Ivor Horton. ""Just Java"" seems like was written to simply let you know that the language exists and it has this and this feature, but it doesn't teach how to use them. I don't even see it as being a good reference book. The 5-star reviewers must have been paid to give such good comments on this book."
26607,-1,NOT so good,"Not a very good book to learn Java. I found that the book doesn't organized very well, and you will still get confused if you are a beginner even after you read the book throughly."
26612,-1,Missing substantial passages on Kindle version,"I would give this Sherlock Holmes story 5 stars, the low rating is due to the poor Kindle formatting. I know it is free but there are substantial passages missing... parts that are very important to the story... such as the actual legend of the Hound of the Baskerville. If you are truly interested in reading this story, there is a version that is only $1 to download and is complete."
26614,-1,Paranormal forces in my mystery?,"I expected to find it a little dry, but overall likeable. Instead, I found the story a little too far to the supernatural, and Sherlock Holmes turned out to be one of the most unlikable characters I've read in a long time! I really felt for Watson, who did not come across as the dumb, stumbling sidekick. I had a hard time slogging through the book, and it didn't make me want to pick up any more Holmes anytime soon. I guess I expected a little more ""Basil of Baker Street"" from The Great Mouse Detective."
26625,-1,Where did the tutorials go?,"I played the game through all levels of the tutorials and advanced to 'one-on-one' with D. Trump... I did okay. Then I didn't play the game for while and when I went to play it again and get a refresher from the tutorials they were ""GONE""! Now the game will not play at all...... No help from the 'Website' either.. That is just an order site only. So I would not buy this again."
26633,-1,Bad ink?,"Item arrived with black powdery smudges on the cover and edge of paper. I don't know if it's from the laser ink powder of the packing slip, or if it's from the printing on the cover. It is acceptable but messy. Also, the photo clearly shows a set of 2 books, but there's only one as detailed in the description."
26635,-1,thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high,"I thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high.... this was just a waste of my time and money, now I will have to drive to town and get these items so I can get the project done in time!"
26636,-1,lame photos and dreary topic,"This book should be called ""white girl culture""... there is hardly an ethnic looking girl in the book! Lots of suburban teen-age girls looking like they are trying to be fit in. Nothing really insightful, new or surprising. Some photos are a bit interesting but most are overly self-conscious from subject and photographer... sorry but these images are easy to forget,(and border on teasing male viewers)... save your money and wait for the video!"
26638,-1,Lack of Sensitivity,"Some funny talk, yes. But this movie is the opposite of sensitivity, to say it politely. The film of cause has a bigger concept. If you want to be surprised, stop reading right now. Two strangers meet by looking at the same vacant apartment in Paris. Skipping the romance, he suddenly decides to get physical with her, and she goes along. At this point, I should have stopped the movie, which went downhill until the end, which was the most disturbing scene. All in all, one might ask the question if the fact that two famous actors are the lead characters, can justify the so-called critics praising this movie. They might have both done it only for the money, being ashamed for it later on. Let's hope so."
26641,-1,They Say Its Rated NC 17...WHY,There Was Not Really That Much Sex In The Film. There was some brutal language Butr Not that much in sex. This film was not at all what they all said it to be. I myself is into love stories such as this and if your a fan like me...dont get this. but dont take my word for it
26672,-1,great movie massacred by tape quality,"One of my all time favorite movies has been edited for television recorded extended long play, and packaged as though nothing was done to it. don't buy this tape wait for the dvd version that should be coming out soon."
26674,-1,Interesting Subject; Poor Presentation,"You'd be hard-pressed to tell a boring story about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to 'em. But this author has done it. He says the book is an adaptation of his doctoral thesis. That fits. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not like a dramatic novel. It strives to identify key historical facts at the expense of the reader's interest. With a modest amount of effort, it could have been reworked as a compelling autobiographical novel bolstered by its remarkable display of features of midwestern life during the first half of the 20th Century."
26676,-1,"Not Mac Compatible, broke before printing a few thousand pages","This printer, though mostly functional when connected to a Windows box, did not work without significant amounts of effort when connected to a Mac. Customer support at HP was not helpful in resolving my Mac connectivity issues. I eventually got it working with some 3rd party tools, but then the printer power supply died. I called HP customer support again and was told to buy a new HP printer.Needless to say, this is the last HP printer I will own. I suggest looking at some of the Brother models instead."
26682,-1,Great Saint - Movie a bit slow - drawn.,Indepth information about PadrePio - but the story could have been told in the usual 90 mins.This man suffered with the stigmata for 50 years ! Locution - Read hearts - Heard confessions for 18 or more hours a day - people waited days to have him hear (read their hearts) confession.
26683,-1,B rated film,"This is a very, very long film, but poor performances make it longer. $24 is a lot to pay for an incomplete story line."
26696,-1,This is NOT the current edition !!!!,"Well, who'da thought it? Bought this, thinking it was somewhat akin to the current edition and what to my surprise, it is the 1906 version and it isn't worth BEANS. What a waste of time and money.Now the current version of this book would be a good addition to anyone's library."
26704,-1,big name - low rating,"I purchased the 350 wireless adapter as a second adaptor for a second laptop on my wireless LAN. My first laptop has a Compaq WL110 PCMCIA adaptor which out performs the Cisco hands down on range and connectivity. The Cisco comes with some fancy disgnostic tools which states signal to noise ratios with no loss whereas a simple ping test clearly displays packet loss. I am disappointed as a IT proffessional and someone who thought that a cisco card would be the best. Not the case, buy Compaq or 3com."
26705,-1,"An adequate, but enjoyable look at grown stanford frat boys","Willie Williams and his fraternity brothers from ""the University"" (Stanford thinly disguised) go through the second world war and return to pick up their lives. Their problems are as expected: the cold war, the Vietnam War, their alienated offspring, and -- par for the course for Drury -- latent homosexuality among some of the brothers and marital problems (usually boredom and the greener grass syndrome) among most of the others. Trite as it sounds, the book will entertain you, especially if you formed an attachment to this group whom Drury first introduced in ""Toward What Bright Glory"". Even though it is a distinctly mid brow read, chances are if you start it, you'll hang on until the not so surprising end."
26708,-1,Coffee Never Hot Enough,"My coffee cup just barely fit on the plate. I thought I would try a different manufacturer of mug warmers. I already had one that worked. Both products worked the same. I realize that the voltage has a limit on it, but it just doesn't keep the coffee hot enough unless you can drink your cup of coffee in 30 minutes. I sip on mine for 2 hours and get very tired of continually having to zap the coffee in the microwave just to heat it up while still using the coffee warmer.Can the manufacturer's come up with a better idea that actually works?"
26721,-1,Overheats the liquid,"I am on vacation and purchased this product as I love another brand (forget which one) at home. I am finding it is making the coffee taste burned when it gets down to less than 1/2 mug. Am wondering, after reading other reviews, if there is a lack of consistency in the manufacturing."
26722,-1,Not worth it,This warmer looks better than it works. Does not keep beverages hot....only slightly warm. Might be ok for kids drinks but not adults. Wont buy another one.
26727,-1,Disappointed with the finish,The unit I received is full of scratches on the surface. I am not sure if it's a brand new unit or not. since it works fine I just didn't bother to exchange for another one.
26728,-1,Needs an AutoShutoff switch,"I like the Mr Coffee cup warmer in most respects. However, a couple of features that are sorely missing and I am surprised that this product can be marketed without them.There is no auto shutoff switch. I have had other cup warmers in the past that would shutoff after an hour. They also had a sensor that would shut off if no cup was present.I have left my cup warmer on with no cup sitting there a burning all night when I was sleeping. How much more would it cost to add these important safety and energy conservation capabilities.I would gladly pay the difference."
26729,-1,Fair at best,"I agree with the others. You have to use a flat bottom mug. I looked through my large collection, and they all have a small lip on the bottom. This is the only part of the mug touching the hot plate, and that tiny amount of surface will not keep the beverage hot, unless the cup is nearly empty. My old one worked all day, everyday, for 14 years. I never paid attention to the manufacturer. Too bad. Now I still have to go to the microwave every few minutes to heat my drink. I wish I could find out what kind of cup the 4 and 5 star reviewers have."
26733,-1,Barely warm,"As usual Amazon service and delivery was superb. The product however, the Mr. Coffee cup warmer is barely that...that is it's barely warm. These are supposed to keep your coffee, tea, or other hot drink hot. Not scalding, but hot enough to enjoy as a hot drink. I'm sorry I made the purchase."
26736,-1,Fur coat and no Knickers,"The warmers don't keep fluid warm. I read my comments and in trying to be humorous i became inarticulate. As you can see. I purchased three of Mr. Coffee mug warmers. As one of the last of the big spenders I expected to keep coffee warmer than tepid. I know that burning houses down is not good for the Mr. Coffee image but in ""She Who must be obeyed's"" dressing room, She who rules, bedside cabinet and subserviant he, lukewarm isn't what we wanted - so she tells me. I intend to try one of another brand and see if there is a difference. Want to buy nearly unused coffee warmers - well known brand?Is this the hyper link? [...]"
26744,-1,Don't buy it,"Don't buy this product. It keeps the liquid only tepid, not warm at all. The cozy warmer is much better as it keeps liquids warm. I bought this one because the on and off switch was easily accessible. Big mistake."
26745,-1,Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed in this thing. I would say it needs an auto shut-off but it would be a waste of time and energy. This warmer keeps the bottom of the cup nice and warm but the liquid inside remains tepid. The warming surface is too small for my large, ceramic mug. The price was OK but I'm shopping for another. My advice, don't waste your money unless you want to warm anything larger than a demitasse."
26753,-1,Would Not Recommend,Bought this for my wife to replace an old cup warmer she had that died. She was totally disappointed with the product. It was not effective at keeping coffee in her mug warm.
26757,-1,Really... get rid of Bradley...,"The ONLY reason I am giving this book a MARGINAL 2 stars is because it is entertaining in how bad it is. The plot is contrived, the characters are one sided and annoying and the writing is wretched. And no... it's not even funny. I didn't even crack a grin.But probably the biggest annoyance with the book is how annoying the characters itself are. Lucy tries so desperately to assert her ""independence"" it's irritating... and the bad boy sexy mytery cop? The whole mid-life crisis thing made him not so mysterious... and defiantly not sexy...Honestly there were times when I had to stop reading in the middle of a chapter and just walk away because it just raditated with... stupidity.If you want to read about a smart, funny airhead, with not one but TWO sexy men than please check out Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum series.Trust me, you're wasting your time by reading the title."
26758,-1,Reads as a rush job,"This book was a disappointment in comparison to other Crusie books. Her books were my first foray into contemporary romance. The plot is not too developed or very interesting for that matter. And the main characters, they come off pretty flat."
26763,-1,what you will need to begin to sew,"Boring, speaker very unenthusiastic, not enough sewing information"
26764,-1,"Baby Loves It, But I Don't","This book is a series of photos depicting a baby and a grandpa sharing an activity such as painting or eating. My two-year-old daughter loves going through page by page and naming each activity. My problem is that, except for one Asian, all of the babies and grandpas are white. It doesn't reflect the ethnic mix of America at all. I don't want my daughter assuming that all grandpas look the same. It bothers me every time we read it."
26768,-1,Smallville,"I have a strong connection with excellent speed. The show stopped at least 4 times due to signal disruption. I have no problems with connection at any other time. When the video did play, the video was high-def half of the time. I purchased high-def, but it was not good sound or video quality. The price and availability are the advantages."
26769,-1,bad review,It was so low that I could not hear it.I turned my volume up as loud as I could get it but still had toreally listen to get what was going on. also very dark . I loveSmallville & had watched it last night on t.v. but still did notenjoy this cause I could not hear it.
26773,-1,Disapointed,"I recieved the product in a timley manner but when i played the discs they skipped and there was distortion on the screen, mixed up pixels. Im not sure if it was the DVDs or my DVD player although the rest of my DVDs play ok.."
26774,-1,The worst movie I've ever seen about these 2 great pilots,"too phoney, lots of errors in the way the movie was made, also bad lip syncing from the woman singer, they played them off as ruthless killers when in fact all other stories tell otherwise. One part shows the bullet shot to the top of his head while flying, but yet when you see him with his head bandaged up its wraped around the side of his head for a wound to the top."
26775,-1,It's no longer the worst movie on the subject,"Quite aside from the historical gaffes-- which are many and well documented by others-- it's a really lousy movie because the characters are so clumsy. Everyone is nasty to everyone else. Bad attitudes pass for 'drama.'I thought it was the worst movie on the subject of all time, but have recently seen the newer ""The Red Baron."" While that movie has much nicer airplanes, it has its own long list of historical absurdities-- I think it 'wins' the race to fairy tale.But on top of that, the dialogue is so silly and the editing so chopped up that you can't even follow the storyline.So ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" is only the 2nd worst movie on the subject. Still awful."
26776,-1,Why isnt this movie in Widescreen?,This is a fantastic movie....I would buy it in a second...all those features and commentary sound wonderful but I wont buy this DVD until it comes out widescreen.
26781,-1,"Great movie, bad DVD treatment.","A cute, romantic comedy. Great scenes of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Very good character development, and Cher and Nicolas Cage work very well together. Olympia Dukakis does a great job as an emotionally deep, morally strong mother with a sense of humour. Great music too, though the 5.1 mix was not very dynamic. Sound stays mainly in the center channel, which itself was muddy, making dialogue difficult to follow at times. The video was pan and scan, which ruins it in my book."
26783,-1,Brilliant Movie - Poor DVD,"Serves me right for not checking the viewer reviews first! I absolutely love this movie and gave away my VHS version after I ordered the DVD. So, I *still* have 4:3 screen format, not the Widescreen format I was so looking forward to. Focussing on ""content"" only would be misleading for DVD buyers, Amazon, and I'm tempted to return it. Subtract three stars for a really irritating studio decision."
26795,-1,cheap diapers,I typically use the pampers swaddlers and thought this would be a good cheaper alternative. These diapers tended to give off gel balls more and worst of all did not have a wetness indicator. Although the swaddlers are more expensive they're definitely worth the money.
26797,-1,They have changed the design!,"I'm a little peeved I been using Pampers Nany-Dry for 2 Years, unannounced the company that makes Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers has made a major design change to Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers (they seem more like Huggies) - much more elastic, narrower straps and much less absorbent material. It's hard to make it thru the night without a diaper change now!"
26798,-1,Wish I bought a smaller pack,"I bought these because I had a really good deal. Unfortunately, the deal was too good to be true. My daughter consistently pees out of the front when she wakes up in the morning. During the day, these diapers are fine because she lets us know when she has peed. I wouldn't put them on at night. They tend to leave little opaque pebbles on her butt. As for the sizing, they tend to run big with tabs made for newborns. I would use these at daycare or in the diaper bag because you can get 5-6 diapers in a small bag. Right now, I would rank generic diapers from HEB (I live in Texas) better than Pampers."
26801,-1,Waste of money,Buying Pampers or Huggies is flushing your money down the toilet. Luvs work just as well at a fraction of the cost.
26805,-1,"The bigger the diaper, the less it holds...","In the past year, I've come to appreciate and only purchase the Pampers brand for my growing daughter's needs. After reaching 15 months of age, however, the diaper wasn't able to keep hold up to overnight use and I started using a nighttime diaper from a different manufacturer. As grandmothers and others watch the baby, they don't know which diaper to use at which time, so I've completely switched from Pampers to another more sturdy brand that doesn't leak and doesn't cause wet mornings."
26813,-1,Was not impressed by this product,I saw that Pampers had a good deal on subscribe and buy so I decided to try it out. Unfortunately it did not work out for us. We had a lot of leaky diapers. We have tried out Huggies and Kirkland brand diapers and are happy with those. My first preference would be Huggies and then Kirkland
26814,-1,Pampers Baby Dry All Wet,"I purchased 204 Pampers Baby Dry Diapers. They are different from ones I have bought in the past. The first week we used them, my 10 month old son peed through his diaper two nights (which he had never done previously) in the middle of the night. They are thin and do not stand up to wetness the way other pampers do. Now I have to go out and buy night diapers to get through all these diapers. I will never buy these again."
26822,-1,Dry but not the best choice for size 1,Props:- The diaper actually does a good job on dry out.Cons:- It is too thin to hold watery poop- It does not have a wetness indicator.Definitely not a good choice for new parents. I will probably buy it when the baby older than 6 months because it's cheaper than others.
26828,-1,no,We Liked the swaddlers. Now that my daughter is older we needed protection and switched to huggies snug and dry.
26830,-1,Gave my baby a rash,"We have always used Pampers Swaddlers and loved them, but they only go up to size 3. Now that my daughter is 14 months old, we needed to move her to size 4. I ordered an economy pack of Pampers Baby Dry diapers and she has a terrible rash. I don't think she has particularly sensitive skin, either. We've tried Pampers Cruisers before and will definitely be moving back to those. Although, I don't like this particular product of Pampers, it's the only brand that doesn't leak for us!"
26831,-1,Buy CRUISERS instead; these leak too easily.,"I bought a pack of the Baby Dry diapers for what I thought would be for night-time use and use our Cruiser subscription for day use. We have a 20-mos boy and we do not like the Baby Dry at all; my son has woken up a few times with urine soaked shirts and shorts so aside from being unhygenic, these diapers just lack the quality or thickness that the Cruisers are so we'll be cancelling our subscription for them. LOVE CRUISERS for day and overnight use though."
26833,-1,Pampers vs. Huggies,"And the winner is......... Huggies.Pampers overnights makes a promise it cannot keep - '12 hours of overnight protection'.Not long after I began using pampers overnight I noticed my son was waking up wet. The kicker - when he wetted himself and his dad after a mere 5.5 hours with no diaper change on a long road trip. (Oops). I even tried plastic underwear - but even that could not help. .I finally figured out if my LO had more than one bottle the diaper merely could not handle the output. Yikes. I thought I would take a chance and try huggies. It's been a week and so far no complaints. He has even woken up dry after having a second bottle in the middle of the night with no diaper change. (tsk tsk but as any mother can tell you, do not mess with a sleeping baby or you will live to regret it). I will keep you posted on any changes!"
26834,-1,It leaks,We used Swaddlers size 1 and thought would changed to this for size 2 to see what's the difference. We found that this one leaks! It also has a little chemical smell and the size isn't as big as Swaddlers size 2. Pamper Swaddlers is much better in our opinion.
26838,-1,Not an overnight diaper,"I have used pampers cruisers consistently and mistakenly bought these baby dry ones this time around. It was a mistake. My 21-month old (21 pounds) sleeps 12 hours a night and with these diapers in size 4 (up to 37 pounds) she wakes up with pee having soaked through the diaper onto her pajamas. She ever peed through the diaper on a 2 and a half hour flight. Not sure why they are called baby dry, but they sure don't keep her dry at all. I just placed another order for the cruisers, but now I'm stuck with 150 of these poor diapers too."
26840,-1,bad,"Used pampers cruisers,just loved them, for over 2 yrs.....then they just stopped making those and started baby dry. I hate these. Leak all the time. I dont understand pampers,why fix whats not broken??Now have ordered huggies,hope they are better.neeta.doc.nita@gmail.com"
26842,-1,Incomplete Shipment,The diapers were fine except my order was for 124 diapers and I only received 112. I also didn't have any way of contacting the shipper to let them know that my order was incomplete.
26850,-1,Not a Fan!,I have been using Pampers Cruisers and wanted to try Baby Dry to see how they worked. They are fine for during the day but horrible for at night. My little girl woke up cold due to her diaper didn't hold in what it should have overnight which made her onesie soaked in the morning. Will NOT buy anymore Baby Dry...Wondering if maybe I can exchange????
26851,-1,Ok product,Not the latest product. Does not have wet line indicator like the new ones. You need to keep on checking at the diaper to find out if it is wet.
26853,-1,Not that great,"Will not buy again, save your money and just buy LUVS, the only advantage the baby dry have is that they smell good. We went thru almost twice as many diapers trying to keep our baby dry.lol"
26857,-1,They leak :(,"I loved swaddlers but they are only in small sizes so I moved to baby dry. Well with teething there is diarrhea and even when I ran to the changing table to change him after an audible bm it was on it's way out of the top back of the diaper and the sides, also I bought them thinking they had the flexible side panels, which are wonderful because you don't feel like your cutting off your babies circulation if you want them snug. I must have received an older box and it did not have the flexible sides. I have since switched to cruisers and love them."
26865,-1,bad pampers,"I have used pampers primarily since my son was born. THIS box has REALLY disappointed me!! More often than not the left side tab TEARS OFF as I am putting it on, which then makes the diaper USELESS!! I called pampers and they sent me a $5 coupon, BUT more than 50 of these diapers has been wasted!! I don't think i will EVER order this again!!"
26866,-1,Baby dry diapers are NOT for us.,"I decided to try the cheaper Pampers Baby Dry instead of my usual Pampers Cruisers. I figured there couldn't be much of a difference, but boy there sure was! I HATE the Baby Dry diapers! Every time my son urinates there is such a strong pee smell that I assume he has peed right through the diaper. However, I check him, and it's not through the diaper - it just smells like it! I can't stand that! I've never had a diaper perform like this one does. I WON'T be ordering this kind again, that's for sure!"
26867,-1,Leaky,My baby wakes up everyday with wet clothes in front! Not something we have every had in the past 13 mo's with other brand diapers. Would not buy these diapers again. The fabric is soft and the diaper is not stiff I do like the texture and overall feel but when the baby is waking up wet and mad this needs to be addressed. Defiently not Baby dry! Overall not satisfied.
26873,-1,LEAKS GALORE!,"These diapers crack and leak all over! On the bright side however, baby never has a rash with these. So they keep her bum dry and her onesies soaked. hmmmm... Is there a happy medium?"
26875,-1,"bad fit, many ""blow outs""","I don't know if this a ""2nds"" product. When the same product was bought at Target, the fit was great, no leaking, no blowouts. When bought through Amazon....nothing but problems. The only reason delivery continued is because I forgot to terminate it, then my baby was on to a different size."
26886,-1,not so dry....,"Diaper didn't last through the night. My 2 year old woke up multiple times needing to be changed (totally unusual for him). The gel beads inside the diaper became really cold when wet and the diper completely ripped open, allowing the wet, cold gel beads to spill all over the place. I'm going back to my normal pampers and just getting the next size up--hopefully that works."
26895,-1,Beware,Its not what is expected. I really did'nt like Pampers Baby dry.I have been using Pampers Swaddlers dry max since my baby was born. I had no problem with it. It was really soft and feels good. But comparatively Pampers Baby dry is not good. It looks like plastic.By seeing the price i ust got fooled..So Beware before purchasing this product.
26911,-1,Not absorbant enough,I liked these the best when my baby was 16 lbs. but now at 20lbs he leaks through every one of them in 2 hours or less. The 4's fit a little too big and I know he's almost ready but these are supposed to be good to 28lbs and they are not. I have almost an entire case of these that I am donating because I don't trust them. Size 3 of Sam's Club brand is working WAY better than these and cost less too.
26912,-1,Ok ...,Not Worked on my baby.... he drinks plenty of water.. so obviously tooks more diapers at night times...i was keep on changings 2 or 3 times every night ...it didnt set for babies who takes plenty of water
26917,-1,Difficult,I wish this was broken into sections like the copy I borrowed from the library. It's kind of overwhelming the way it is printed without any breaks.
26926,-1,"Difficult to find events, and some events ignored","It is difficult to find specific events in this DVD -- partly because the Main Menu is organized by Olympics Day 1, Day 2, and so on; and partly because some events simply aren't there. Kim Yu-Na, for instance, is on the screen for only a few seconds. So don't look here for her world record-setting performances (or any other figure skating performances, come to think of it). If you know what day the event you are looking for took place, that would help. But there's still no guarantee that it would be included.It seems that this DVD is meant for casual viewing. If you would like some sports rumbling on your TV, and you aren't particular about what, then this might be for you. It does include highlights of the opening and closing ceremonies, and of performances by Lindsay Vaugn, Shaun White, and Apollo Ohno. But they are just highlights, and you have to take them as you find them -- that is, IF you find them."
26934,-1,bad power suplly,i bought this 18 months ago. i purchased a refurb unitwell about 2 months ago the ps started to act up.$90.00 later it's working again. Many people have experienced this problem with the ps

26937,-1,Well...,"The writing style was fine, but I didn't find it interesting in the least. It may be a classic, but it really didn't do anything for me."
26939,-1,Jennifer Love Hewitt flops as Audrey Hepburn,Jennifer Love Hewitt doesn't look a thing like Audrey Hepburn. I truely believe that the producers and casting directors made a terrible call casting Hewitt. The actress who I believe reminds people of Audrey as well as looks like her is Natalie Portman (who is an exceptional actress). Natalie would have made a much mcuh better Audrey Hepburn.
26940,-1,Not at all Audrey Hepburn,"JLH did a terrible job at portraying Audrey Hepburn. She seemed depressed most of the time and the insecurity depiction was too much. JLH looks NOTHING like Miss Hepburn so I don't konw why she was given that part. She does not have the elegance or the grace of Miss Hepburn, and she did this head shaking thing waay too much. Her accent was off most of the time, and her singing (although it's good) sounded nothing like Miss Hepburn. They should have played a recording instead! Overall, I was disappointed and, as others have already said, Natalie Portman would have been a much better Miss Hepburn."
26942,-1,curious explanations of behavior,"Too many statements of duratiion of time profiling with clear poor grasp of human behavior. ""No mother would act this way."" Vain, aging beauty queen mothers facing their 40th birthday with a history of dolling up in tights and rouge their preschool age children can probably be suspected of behavior slightly different from the norm. Interesting cases presented, but interpretations of behaviors are superficial, lack insight, lack curiosity. Why did Patsy Ramsey sit unmoved on the sofa while others with her reacted to screams from the basement--Duh.. No clear answer to who would sit and compose lengthy note without worry of discovery--Duh. I am inspired to seek other authors for insights."
26948,-1,Not as Good as the 2nd Edition,"If you liked the 2nd Editon of the Standard Catalog of Cadillac, you'll undoubtedly be disappointed in this edition. This edition trades LaSalle information and price guide for a few more color photos of Cadillacs. While the LaSalle price guide is gone completely, the Cadillac price guide is unbelievably incomplete, leaving out pricing for 1921 through 1925, 1927-28, 1931 through 1935,38, 1940,46, 47,1950,51,52,1954 through 1958,1960through 1962 - and more. This edition leaves a lot to be desired for the true Cadillac/LaSalle aficionado."
26952,-1,A BAD RISK,"Got this camcorder for christmas 3 yrs.ago.After storing the camcorder for about 1 yr. I charged the battery and when I went to check a tape that I had recorded 14 mos. ago there was no picture on the monitor and the viewfinder.I had sound but no picture.I called the JVC service division and they told me to ship it to them and they would check it out and tell me how much it would cost to fix it.I also went to an authorized JVC repair shop and was told that this was a problem that JVC had know about and that if I send it to the JVC that they would fix it for free.The JVC service division person I spoke to told me that I would have to pay.I am confused and very upset that JVC doesn't standby their product.If I have to by another camcorder,I'd never buy a JVC."
26953,-1,Less than average product,"The product works fine, but the quality of the material is pretty cheap. It doesn't have a nice feeling while holding it in your hand.On top of this, the battery compartment door broke the second time I had to replace the battery, so now I have to use it with a scotch tape around it.All in all, I believe there are better deals out there. In particular, try to get a presenter that uses AA or AAA batteries. You can find them anywhere."
26957,-1,Doesn't Make It,"The intention is good but the book is spoiled by using gray scale pictures (except for a four page color section out of 700+ pages)which do not illustrate the authors results. One bright note, the author does explain the basics tools and features of PhotoShop Elements clearly but the lack of color detracts too much to make this book worthwhile. There are a lot of books on the subject which do an admirable job and this one comes up short."
26962,-1,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD because I missed seeing it at a local theatre that features old films, but I was disappointed in that the story wasn't good or interesting. However, I wanted to see the dancers, the Step Brothers - I think they were called, where they did that fantastic dance down the stairs. That was unbelievable! Also wanted to see beautiful Lena Horne, but disappointed that they didn't have her in beautiful gowns. So, other than the Step Brothers dancing, I was bored."
26968,-1,The Last Days of Patton,"I found this movie very disappointing. I guess after Patton anything else would be hard to compare. That said, I had high hopes given the fact that I enjoyed the original so much. I did not even get half way through it before becoming bored with the plot. Stick with the original, you will not be sorry."
26969,-1,I guess this could be an appropriate title...,"While there are juicing recipes in here there are a lot of recipes that are more appropriate for blender or food processor. As part of my resolution this year I bought a juicer but many recipes make very large quantities- Like 3 quarts or even a gallon! Um, if I need to feed juice to that many people I doubt I'd ever use my juicer and would instead by concentrate or the prepared stuff from the market. Not really helpful for the novice juicer."
26973,-1,"Shoddy piece of work, notable only for the presence of Gwynne","Anne Gwynne was one of those Hollywood supporting players who appeared in a lot of movies, but was seldom recognized. She normally ended up playing romantic leads in B-movies - often a weak person, but with a feisty streak in her that made her too hot to handle for her insipid male co-stars. Made later on in her career, TEENAGE MONSTER has very little to recommend it, except as a poor imitation of I WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN. Gwynne tries her best as a parent, but has little to work with."
26975,-1,"Uh, well...","Really mediocre romantic comedy featuring a brown-haired Helen Hunt before Mad About You and As Good As It Gets, Kelly Preston before her career surge, and Andrew McCarthy on the downside of his Brat Pack run. Shows up occasionally on cable, and best left there."
26979,-1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I've had this book for over a year and I must say that as time goes by, I am less and less impressed with this book. I have no problem following instructions yet it took me three tries to get some of these recipes to turn out. I never got her sweet nut crust to work. I used the recipe from ""In the Sweet Kitchen"" instead and the crust came out perfect.And some of the recipes are not nearly as imressive as they look. The only recipe that I've made that received any ""wows"" from my guests was the tiramisu tart, and that wasn't until the third time I made it when I made significant changes to the recipe. A few of the recipes were huge disappointments.I would highly recommend ""In the Sweet Kitchen"" or the Cindy Mushet book instead."
26980,-1,Devil's in the details.,"The recipe instructions are inconsistent and ridiculously overcomplicated. ""Great"" pumpkin pie, for example. The instructions say to bake the pie directly on the oven floor. If you have a gas oven that heats from the bottom, you are getting nothing but a burnt pie (thanks for a Thanksgiving failure, Rose). Designer Apple Pie is nice, the trick of boiling down the apple juices is slick. But the cream cheese crust? I've had better results from the Joy of Cooking recipes. Her recipes are too fragile to be reproduced consistently. If you are off by a degree in the oven, or off by a minute in the timing, forget it, your pie is ruined. Other pie recipes are less sensitive. Working with her crust recipes is like walking on eggshells.I've been making pies for 20 years. I can't say the details that make Berenbaum's recipes so complicated make her pies much better than ones I've made in the past from other cookbooks. Very disappointing."
26981,-1,Sigh!,"I've had this book since year nought. But I have never made anything from it. Having said that I currently have cubed butter and a flour mixture in the freezer. My first stab at making pie from this tome. Obviously my rating of 2 stars does not reflect the quality of the recipes. It's reserved for the wonderful folks at Scribner. I think Ms Beranbaum might be the world's most gifted cake/pie/bread maker but she certainly needs a bit of help when it comes to picking a publisher. My 'Cake Bible' fell apart very quickly as the pages couldn't wait to detach themselves from the feeble spine. This has not happened to my pie bible coz as I said, I've never used it. The sections are not very well organized and having to refer back and forth is annoying. A couple of those built-in bookmarks (like the Gourmet cookbook) would have been so helpful. Anyway, I can go on all day but other reviewers have beaten me to it."
26982,-1,Not for the novice,"After reading just a couple of her receipies, I discovered this book is not for the faint at heart when it comes to baking. Although when I watched her on an early morning program, I gathered there was a more balanced experience of receipies. Her citation of types of flour is simply more information that I was interesting in having and boardered on what one might call flour snobbery. So far, the only method I have regularly incorporated in my pastry baking is her reference to chilling. So as all is not down the pastry funnel, I will pick and choose a few more receipies now and then to try."
26983,-1,bad recipes--buyer beware,"This book has some good baking TIPS, but many of the recipes simply do not work. I'm a fairly experienced baker and don't seem to have this kind of trouble with other books."
26987,-1,Not 8 just 4!,They are good but it's not a set of 8 just 4! So I was dissapointed because wanted to use all 8 and because of the price (twice more expensive that it seemed).
26991,-1,talk about navel-gazing...,"Okay already, I'm convinced you have chops! You don't have to keep trying to impress me...or each other...or yourselves...This album encapsulates the fatal flaw of jazz music, the element that is relegating it to the dustbin of history: form over substance. Nobody will care about the technical achievements of these guys in 100 years (not many do now except those who confuse self-obsession with depth). There are moments, especially the middle section, where Coltrane and co. hint at some melodic structure, some level of aesthetic appeal, but inevitably a stylized flourish ruins everything. I suppose it's good that someone pushed the 'repetitive droning and squawking' envelope, but do you really want to listen to him do it?Art reaches out, speaks to the universal, appeals to the heart. Jazz excludes, speaks in code, demands analysis. I prefer art."
26993,-1,Lassie fans are learning not to get their hopes up,"When I first heard there was an upcoming Lassie release I got my hopes up. I hoped it was the beginning of proper season sets of the classic Lassie series. Of course, like most Lassie fans, I've learned to hope for the best but expect the worst. There's not many details on this listing yet, but from the cast list it appears to be the 2005 movie. So, instead of what I was hoping for, Lassie fans get a release of a recent movie, which is already available on DVD(ASIN: B000ICL3ME), with an impostor playing Lassie. Please Classic Media, start releasing full season sets of the classic series with complete uncut episodes in chronological order!!!"
27001,-1,SONY loudness,It plays fine but the rewind and fast forward is a loud motor running. I'm going to return it for perhaps another SONY or Panasonic.
27005,-1,Doesn't do timeshifting with my Mitsubishi,This product I got yesterday doesn't do all its features when connected to my Mitsubishi 62525. It seemed to work ok but when I actually tried to record something it would lose its connection. Will probably return it if I can't get it to be stable this weekend.
27008,-1,Not Happy,As soon as I opened the package I knew something wasn't right because there was sand inside. I put them on later in the day and there was sand on my arm. I finally found the hole in one of the weights. Not happy to say the least.
27010,-1,Too Small,It hurts my wrist to slip this on and off. It would have been much better if it had a velco strip or something where you could wrap it around the wrist instead of having to force it on.
27012,-1,Good only for the first few days,"So i purchased these weights a few days ago and they appeared very comfortable. But after a few days, the cloth started to expand and then sand started to seep through. This product was only good for teh first few days of purchase."
27019,-1,Damnation by Disjointure,"I enjoyed the storyline and charactor development. It should have been a 'good read' but was, for me, spoilt by cumbersome presentation and 'arty' expression. I was looking for a story which the theme promised but it got lost in the litteray world. Why can't these writers present ideas and thoughts simply? Complexity does not equate with 'quality'. I also deplore the trend of many a horror novel nowadays having to have a statutary gay component. What's wrong with a bit of plain old spine chilling with a touch of straight on the side?When I finished this story I was not desperately looking for another by the same author! Compare this to ""The Stake' or ""Crota' which where fun reads."
27021,-1,The Day That Sunny Day Died,"When I bought this album, I felt like crying. My favorite band, Sunny Day Real Estate, had reformed and I was thrilled. Then when I actually heard the CD, it was just a slap in the face. Sunny Day sounds nothing like they did in ""Diary"" or ""LP2"" anymore. They are more of a rather watered-down alternative rock. ""Every Shining Time You Arrive"" is definetely a great song, but there's no other song on the CD that would make you want to buy it. Let's face it...Sunny Day is dead, but what they did in their first two CDs makes them legendary."
27022,-1,I'm sorry,"This album is just plainly a dissapointment. Half the album is brilliant and the other half, well they should have just put this out as and e.p. with only half of the songs. Sure Pillars, Every shining time, and How it feels to be, are brilliant. But they are ruined by 100 million, Two Promises, and Roses in Water. I expected this to be their best album (after hearing Jeremy's solo album, which is a must buy) but it just turns out to studio, which means not that much emotion. Sure Jeremy is screaming, but there is nothing in his scream. Maybe Nate was more important than they'll admit. The emo is only slightly there and that is what they are EMO! Not alt-rock. Don't start with this one. Buy Diary, and hear what one of the most promising bands of all time used to sound like. Maybe they shouldn't have gotten back together."
27023,-1,A great disappointment,"A am a huge SDRE fan, but to tell you the truth their new CD wasn't all that good, their old stuff was way better. SDRE has lost their style and emotion. This CD isn't worth buying."
27031,-1,not for the kids...,I was excited with the release of the new movie but very disappointed with the soundtrack CD. Keeping the kids attention beyond the 3rd track just doesn't cut it. I like the instrumental tracks personally but this should have cut and released as CD-Single containing the 3 voice selections.
27035,-1,Absurd Plot,"The author is quite talented; the book well written. The religious history very interesting. There is sufficient adventure, intrigue and excitement.But the central theme, that many core beliefs of Catholicism are at odds with the God it purports to serve, that Mary herself has repudiated such beliefs, and that a progressive pope will shortly put an end to these beliefs, is more than a stretch, it devolves into an anti-Catholic message that is wrapped around a good yarn. This is exacerbated by the depiction of high church officials as evil Mafia type figures who readily engage in heinous acts, including murder and extortion. Yes, some church officials have in the past been guilty of deceit and cover ups to protect child abusers, but this is a far cry from high church officials engaging in conduct rivaling that of the characters in ""The Godfather"" series. But if comparing the Catholic church to the evil demonstrated in those movies is your cup to tea, then this book is for you."
27046,-1,You have got to be kidding,"The book was pretty well written, but is typical in that the conservatives are the evil ones and the liberals are the good guys. How tiresome that plotline is!! But the unforgivable sin is the third secret. It is just plain stupid. Any one who knows anything about Catholicism will just laugh off the third secret. It is just wishful thinking by people who want their Catholicism in the cafeteria style. I stopped reading it after that."
27056,-1,A few minutes of horror,"There's about 15 minutes of horror film. But the rest of the 2 hours is made up of 2 confused people trying to come to terms with their histories which are related to the horror story portion by analogy (and the man's brief contact with the dead children). There was supposed to be a psychological reason behind the horror -- but it didn't strike me as particularly insightful. Instead it was dreary. The acting, even by Jun Ji Hyun, was dreary. The actions by the characters were dreary. The only sign of life comes from the fiancée -- a strong, dynamic performance by attractive Yu Seon.TO see Jun Ji Hyun at her best, I recommendMY SASSY GIRL,DAISY, orIL MARE."
27060,-1,Terrible compared to other volumes in the series,"I love history books and have read just about all the books in this series.This one was very weak. It starts out okay, but as you go along, it just becomes what other reviewers have noted - a very opinionated, biased piece. But even more than that, the book stops reading as history and more as narrative mishmash of events with the ever present biased commentary.I hate putting books down once started but it took me the better part of two years to get to the end of this. I could only take a few pages at a time and then I'd have to set it aside for a while.Anyway, all I can say is this was a major disappointment."
27062,-1,Limited surround sound support,"This Tivo series2 Dual Tuner has limited surround sound capabilities. If you are NOT using a Cable or Satellite box, chances are you will NOT get surround sound from this device.I was running the coax cable directly into the TiVo, with the outputs going directly to the A/V processor, similar to my VCR and TV. My VCR and TV are both producing surround sound. The TiVo was only able to send a 2 channel signal.I spent almost 2 hours on the phone with TiVo customer support and they were not able to help and just continued to claim that TiVo supports surround. However, on TiVo's own website in the customer forum, I found dozens of entries with issues supporting surround.This appears to be a design flaw."
27063,-1,TIVO,The TIVO arrived in good condition and was easly to install. However to use the device you must have Internet access for your tv and subscribe to a service with a montly fee. I was not prepared for either and have returned the device to the original shipper.
27065,-1,The point of Tivo escapes me!!,"I bought this so I could share movies and vids from my computer to the tivo and play them on our TV. You still need to pay for a monthly subscription thou. You also need to pay for some software to enable you to do it. I realized it was easier to get a wireless video/audio sender and and send the movies wirelessly to the tv for $0 per month. However, I suppose there is a market for this somewhere its just not for me and my house."
27072,-1,repetitive and boring,"this comes from someone who knew nothing of the legend of lord lucan.. but still.. from the opening of the story i was intrigued by it. however, the book is constantly repeating the few details that it shares with us on the crime and lord lucan's disappearance over and over again. i felt the book to be very incomplete. the key word here is repetitive. It's just a bore! Pass it! (the last two sentences being the only in need of capitalization)"
27073,-1,An exquisitely-made little jewel-like box-- unfortunately em,"I kept getting the feeling as I read this book that I was supposed to be impressed by its elegance--an elegant, exotic heroine, living in Paris. Not one, but two men claiming to be an internationally-famous criminal. Spare, sophisticated prose and dialogue. But I just couldn't make myself be interested in the characters or the plot.I can't be more specific without revealing more of the plot, but I just couldn't feel that the plot was interesting or believable. The characters were so sparely drawn that I just couldn't care about them. Perhaps if I were a Muriel Sparks junkie, I might be more excited, but I just wasn't."
27076,-1,*Thumbs Down*,"This cd isn't TOO bad but at the same time I wish i hadn't bought it. I think the singer said to himself ""Let's see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally"". (And in a realllly bad way) Oddly enough, the absolute best song these guys ever put out isn't featured on either of their cd's. (Sweet Summer) Besides the fact that this is missing that gem of a song, it's nothing like the first cd. Nothing quite like the cathy pop rhythms of Don't Stop on this cd. Just kinda BLAND soft rock. I recommend downloading Sweet Summer as it is their best song by FAR and perhaps possibly buying the first cd, but don't waste your time on this one."
27080,-1,I was a little disappointed...,"It had been a while since I had heard his jokes and standup show. But I did not find this DVD as funny as I expected it.Yes, O'Connolly is unpredictable, but not ""Robin Williams"" umpredictable. It seems more as if he rambles around, goes on the tangent and forgets what he was talking about, and then his jokes lose momentum.Something no one has mentioned is that the producers did not put a lot of effort in the CD. There are no ""Chapters"" to identify the main themes of the show. For foreign speakers or hearing impaired, there are no closed captions. There are no extras. Nothing. It's just a DVD which says ""Play"", and there you go...Hopefully this helps you in your decision."
27081,-1,Odd fit,"The overall idea of the body suit was good however the fit not so much. I am about average hieght 5 6"" and weigh 130 but it seemed like it was made for a person smaller in stature. My guy was pleased with my appearance but the odd fit didn't make me feel as sexy as I wud have liked."
27082,-1,I can't use this in place of parmesan cheese,"The taste is not what I expected - I expected it to taste good and I didn't like the flavor. I mixed it with pesto because I normally use parmesan. It ruined the pesto. Not a big fan of it as a cheese replacement, however, I'm using it as a nutritional supplement for home-made bread - the flavor doesn't come out in the bread. So for nutrition it's good, but not so good for taste."
27086,-1,Not Impressed with Dallas,"I love comedy, but this particular video, in my opinion, has overplayed the use of foul language/cursing - no cussin. There was more cursing than real jokes. I was mostly disappointed with the host, Mo'Nique. The best comedian on this series by far was Paul Mooney, and Corey Holcomb bringing 2nd place. The others were ok, again in my opinion."
27088,-1,The point,"I totally missed the point of the novel. Maybe I need a professor to explain the satire but I did not get it. I kept waiting for the story to tell me something about myself or about society - it never did. After reading some of your reviews, I am led to believe that I totally missed the boat. Did I really?"
27092,-1,Needs to be written in new style english,"I disliked the book very strongly. If it was in new style english and brought out the meanings in plain words it would have been so much better.It took me reading somethings 4 or 5 times to understand its real meaning, and sometimes after that it still didn't make sense to me. I did find it weird how the story from way back at that time is really close to a lot of stories on the Jerry Springer show.To end my review you would like it if you were into old english literature, but thats just not for me."
27097,-1,The Kindling needed more sparks,"This is the story of a group of children left to survive on their own after a virus (hence the series title ""fire-us"" - which is virus in baby-speak)has killed most of the human population.Some parts of the story are interesting. One of the older kids, Hunter, spends a great deal of time searching for food in old stores and houses. The dialogue between the kids, however, is tedious and boring. It is also very difficult to believe that children would end up acting the way the main characters do in this story.If you want to read really good survival stories, then try reading Philbrick's Last Book in the Universe or Robert Swindells' Brother in the Land."
27106,-1,A lead balloon,"As a child we lived in the Yakima Valley. Some summer afternoons my father would take me with him to buy vegetables from a Japanese farmer. My father, normally outgoing, was reserved and deferrential. Dad explained that the farmer before the war had been a successful engineer, but had lost everything when he was forced to go to ""the camp"" - a tragedy and great waste. I've been haunted by that guiet farmer ever since, so it was with enthusiasm that I began Stubborn Twig, the story of a Japanese family's American experience.Stubborn Twig is well researched and chock full of details about the Yasui family. Reading their story should be compelling. It's not. It's repetitious, tedious and a slow, difficult read. The last 50 pages, the third generation, is a mix of biography and sociologist psycho babble. So why read Stubborn Twig? Because it's an important story, an American story that has much to teach us, and one that shouldn't be forgotten."
27113,-1,Cat Claw Scratcher,"Could not get our cat to even think about using it. It just sits there taking up space until I decide to throw it out, or maybe find a neighbor that I could give it away to who has a kitten that could figure out what it's for and use it. But sadly, my older cat won't."
27115,-1,"Very interesting subject, horribly written","I was really interested in reading this book, honestly. But it is so poorly written that I gave up after 30 pages or so. I don't care if it's important stuff, true or whatever. If the writer can't get the job done of explaining it he should leave it to somebody else. It seems he just poured his notes from his journal on the paper in a chronological order, with no overall plan.I give it a second star for the subject matter. If it was for the telling I'd want my money back."
27118,-1,alright,"I bought this pillow after finding out a hotel I stayed in used the same. I don't if it was the product I received but it wasn't as comfortable as I remembered in the hotel and after few washes, the comfort level started to plunge as the feathers started to poke. I won't spend my money on this ever again!"
27121,-1,"Paris, Wyoming","First off, my copy, Hudson House Publishers is a subsidy and self-publishing company. In old terminology, ""Vantage Press"" publishing. James paid to publish his novel. PARIS, WYOMING came as a gift as I generally do not purchase subsidy or self-published books or novels. Most do not exert ""tight"" editing and consist of numerous passive voice verbs and common writing errors. Secondly, I will finish this novel as my ""thank you"" to the one giving this gift. To complete reading PARIS, WYOMING, Wyoming will take forever. Lastly, whatever is the ""Wyoming Writers, Inc. 'New Horizons Award'"" as Jim James is a recipient?"
27127,-1,Do not read this book!!!,"If you enjoyed the rest of the series, stop and don't read this book. Yes, you will be left wondering what happens to the rest of the swords, who is the Emperor, what happens to Mark and the rest, but live with the curiosity. This book goes beyond anticlimactic, it is just awful. The ending and the explanation of the Emperor is so...I can't even find words for how disappointing it is.I'm left wondering if Saberhagen didn't outgrow the series and quickly wrote Shieldbreaker's story to bring the series to a close so he could move on to other endeavors. I can not believe that he actually thought that this ending would satisfy his readers.I can not stress enough how thoroughly disappointing and frustrating the ending of this book is. Saberhagen should personally apologize to everyone who read this book"
27131,-1,Hackneyed commentary by a johnny-come lately,"Not very interesting or informative. Better to buy a year's subscription to INC Magazine or Harvard's Entrepreneur Book.There is very little new information provided here. In fact some, of the information is leads the reader astray from 1999-2000 issues (LLC's, tax implications, true cashflow analysis)"
27138,-1,Paper feed problem,"Paper feed is definitely a serious product defect. I called the HP tech support, but they were not aware of the paper feed cleaning kit that some reviewer mentioned. They only suggested cleaning the roller with dampened cloth.Thanks to Michael C Garrett's ingenious solution, this printer is more or less reusable again."
27143,-1,Problems printing in color after about a month of use,"Things I like: wireless printing to Mac and PC, scanning, and copying. My paper never jammed. I bought this printer and used it for about a month before the color stopped working. I called support numerous times and it was a time-consuming endeavor. Each time, we would get the printer working only to have the color stop working a couple of days later. Due to the time it took to work with support and my busy schedule, I was unable to stay on top of it before my warrantee ran out...maybe that is the HP plan? Anyway, not only does the color not work, but if I don't set the documents to ""black only"", it will print blank space where the colors were. Very annoying. I also do not like how HP software installs all sorts of ""helpful"" stuff that pops up all the time. The only way I could see to avoid that was to only install the driver, but then I couldn't use the scanner."
27152,-1,"Top film, very poor DVD","I have loved this film ever since it was first made, but this DVD really does not do it justice.Despite being called a 'special edition', it contains not a single extra feature. The widescreen format is not anamorphic, which means that the MPEG aspect ratio is 4:3 and the picture resolution of the viewable area is lower than it should be. The quality of the film print used is poor and contains scratches and white speckling. The film has also had some bits edited out, so I suppose you could say it contains a negative number of special features: i.e. some normal features taken out. This is a shocking misuse of the format because the DVD standard contains the possibility for having optional scenes which can be shielded from young viewers, so why wasn't this used?I doubt it will be long before the next version comes out, the 'collector's special edition' or whatever they will call it, so my advice would be to wait for that."
27155,-1,Hey Bob Hoskins...what do you think of Super Mario Bros.?,"The following is excerpted from an actual interview with Bob Hoskins, star of Super Mario Bros.:Guardian: ""So, what's the worst job you've done?""Hoskins: ""Super Mario Bros.""Guardian: ""What has been your biggest disappointment?""Hoskins: ""Super Mario Bros.""Guardian: ""If you could edit your past, what would you change?""Hoskins: ""I wouldn't do Super Mario Bros.""Don't mince words, Bob...how did you REALLY feel about Super Mario Bros.?"
27177,-1,Not good---at all!,"I bought this figuring I got a good deal on a CD player, turns out I just wasted my money. The headphones were horrible, they had a lot of static. And the player itself, well it had to be on a completely flat surface. In a car is not a good place to listen to it. It skips often, and it broke only after a month of purchase."
27178,-1,low volume,"While I expected the CD to occasionally skip, I was disappointed in how low the volume was.I had a Sony Discman and the volume was low on that, but with this player it's ridiculous."
27184,-1,Not Blue Topaz...,"I purchased these earrings for myself, and when they arrived I knew right away they did not look like blue topaz. They are a very pale blue, and look like aquamarine instead. Also, the posts are unusually wide, and are difficult, and somewhat painful, to insert in the ear if you're used to the more common thin posts."
27191,-1,I thought this book had too much irony in it.,"The Mayor of Casterbridge was a very interesting novel. In my opinion Hardy uses too much irony, and this kills the fun of the whole topic. It is true that every day is filled with irony, but it shouldn't be in somthing someone is reading. the novel also shouldn't be too predictable, I guess that's why Hardy likes irony. If you are a reader who likes suspense and tragedy then this book is for you."
27192,-1,Free Kindle Edition is missing a significant portion of Chapter 20.,"The book itself is excellent. Thomas Hardy was a master writer, and look no further than the fact that he makes a story about a person that buys and sells corn interesting. But, the kindle edition is, like the title of the review says, missing a chunk of the text. There might be other parts omitted, but that's the only one I've caught.Perhaps this is evidence that you get what you pay for."
27195,-1,Totally confused,"While I would give the singers somewhat higher marks than Mr. Morrison, he is spot on with everything else. I saw a production of Onegin 2 yrs. ago in Munich that I absolutely hated. Although I disagreed with it's point of view, I understood a great deal of what the director was doing. However with this one I was clueless, time and time again. I must say that I am a big fan of Kwiecien having seen his Don Giovanni (San Francisco) and King Roger (Paris). He is definitely a rising operatic star! Luckily, I was able to see it televised so I didn't waste my money as others have."
27197,-1,hmmm...,"This film is shot beautifully and I liked the way the actors were allowed to meander around in their character to sort of ""make the movie themselves"" as they went along. Unfortunately the movie is made to be ""About"" the ""last days"" of Kurt Cobain. This movie is not accurate and falls short in paying ANY kind of tribute to the memory of Kurt. It distorts his memory if it does any thing which is sad. I enjoy the quiet scenes and all the mood shots, it's a neat reflective film and is actually comedic at times once you take away any reference there might be to Kurt Cobain. I had to MUTE the volume during the scene where the character tries to sing and play like Kurt. Other than that, like I said I like the way the film is shot and made and would have enjoyed it if it did not have something supposedly to do with Kurt Cobain. Any way, that's what I have to say."
27199,-1,What went wrong here?,"Sadly, Gus Van Sant has stopped directing movies. Instead he has become a supervisor of filming. In the DVD supplemental documentary, the cast goes on and on about how wonderful it was to get to be so creative and work without a script. They rave about how much they loved the improvisation and about how great it was that they were CREATING a work of art. In the end, they didn't create anything but a nauseating bore.I turned the subtitles on just so I could understand what ""Blake"" was muttering (it wasn't worth reading so I turned them back off). The film tries to offer insight into the Kurt Cobain like character but I fail to see how watching him make Macaroni and cheese or crawl around on the floor for five minutes or mumble unitelligable monologues offers an audience anything. GET OVER YOURSELF GUS and start making real films again instead of trying to pass this garbage off as 'ART"""
27201,-1,Last Days,"I can't make up my mind, this is an awful movie to watch, but in reality probably quite close to the truth of how the last few days of a man about to kill himself is likely to have been. There are no suprises, no meaningful insights. If Gus Van Sant was trying to guess what the last few days of a drug addicted, depressed man may have been like, that being: depressing, dull, meaningless, lonely, then he succeeded. Its unlikely that anyone would enjoy this film, and maybe you aren't supposed to....."
27204,-1,TRUST ME - DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE - THIS IS JUNK,"Maybe this is how Kurt Cobain spent his ""last days"" but this does not mean it is a good film. This is just another stylish psuedo-intellectual art-house film. Gus Van Sant is quickly becoming like Stephen Sodenberg. A guy trying to make cool artsy flicks that seem really deep in meaning to the very niave watcher, but, like Sodenberg, anyone who even bothers to tread deep into an analysis of this film is apt to feel cheated and tricked. Gus Van Sant even attempts to lift the whole significance of the grunge-scene but this movie just seems so contrived and silly. Like it is looking for some significance to everything when there is none. Just buy another Nirvana album. Don't even bother."
27219,-1,You get what you pay for.,"The dimensions of the miter slot are not provided for this item. Probably because it is undersize. The dimension is 1/4"" deep x 3/4"" wide. This means that any standard miter gauge or sliding shaper jig, will ride high and rock side to side with no table support. The miter gauge supplied is all plastic and is a grand total of 3"" long.It is also difficult to adjust the extension table sections low enough so that they do not interfere with the sliding miter gauge or shaper jig.The only plus on this set-up is a large, easy to access on/off switch.I don't understand why anyone would manufacture an item with so many shortcomings, when it would be just as easy to make the thing right in the first place.The best use for this product would be to mount a non-functioning router, and give the set to a child to play 'Carpenter' with.PS: Shipping was very expensive, ie: 50% of the cost of the item."
27232,-1,Alcohol taste is horrible!,"I did not see a increase in supply with this product. I did notice that my pumped milk was more fatty after sitting in the fridge though. I was taking a double dose and took it round the clock, never missing a dose. I am past a year of breastfeeding and that may be why I did not see a boost. The alcohol taste is completely disgusting. I felt like my breath reaked of the alcohol afterwards and I just couldn't rid the taste from my mouth for several hours. If I try it again with future children, I will definately make sure I get the alcohol free version!"
27233,-1,"Original poem not used, images were of modern players","There are several altered versions of Thayer's classic poem in existance.This book uses one of them.I love this poem, and I wish the author had stuck with the original.Especially when Ernest Lawrence Thayer is listed as the author!Also- the images of Casey and the spectators are of modernday participants. Casey is wearing a helmet and his name andnumber are on the back of his uniform. Not like a playerin 1888 at all.Leroy Neiman is a great artist, and that is the only reason I give this2 stars."

27239,-1,OOOOOMMMMMMMM,"Buy this at a discount price, it's not something you want to buy for $14.00 at a music store."
27252,-1,J.Mills,This book was an alright book. It starts out with Lennie and George in a town called Weed. Then Lennie's obsession with soft things gets them in trouble. They go to another ranch where they meet a few people. Then Lennie gets them in trouble with these new characters. I didn't like this book that much because I don't like to read and it was a boring book. I would only recomened this book to people who like boring books and people 13 years of age and older.
27257,-1,Of mice and men,"What confuses me more than why I was forced to read this book in school was how anyone could call it a masterpiece or a classic for that matter. I'll admit the relationship between Lennie( mentally retarded) and George was sweet. Although as the book so uneventfully progressed, things turned terrible between Lennie accidentally killing Curley's wife and George shooting Lennie. As in both The Pearl and Of Mice and Men, Steinbeck seems to love writing about innocent people getting shot. Steinbeck is a pessimist to say the least and I will never read his works again."
27258,-1,mlms.peteyboy/ps,"""Of mice and men"" is not a very fun book to read it has very bad racial and verbal langauge. for a book to do a report on it would be a very good selection it definitly shows the characters piont of views by explaining thier body language as you read so you can imagine how they feel. it gives importance of characters by putting them in situations that require them to take action.It is mostly a very good book with very interesting characters."
27260,-1,Bad Ending,"I hated the ending of the book, it was awful and depressing. I thought it was going to turn out better!"
27261,-1,Suitable only for Steibeck's fans,"In this classic novel, John Steibeck tells the story of two friends in 1930s California. George and Lennie are Itinerant farm workers.They work for making their dream come true, having a farm of their own with animals, etc.The story develops in a farm, where we know many characters, all of them, have dreams.The main theme on the story is dream, But also violence and loneliness are important. All of the characters, are, in extreme situations, where the only salvation is work, and dream. I did not like so much the book,I find it a bit dense, but the story, theme, and how the story is tell, makes the book, a good book, only suitable for Steinbeck's fans."
27262,-1,"Ramone and Teaira MLMS,CAMBRIDGE,MD","The book ""Of Mice and Men"" was a good book because it shows how someone could take care of another person that isn't very intelligent. It shows how someone could not be smart but still work hard. I liked this book because it showed how someone could committ a crime but for a good cause. I would recommend this book for soft-hearted people. Ramone P.The book ""Of Mice and Men"" didn't really interest me because in a way the title didn't really fit the story. Also, the point of the story was not clear. The title didn't fit the story because the whole book wasn't about mice and men. The only thing in the book about mice was when Lennie kept picking up mice and having them as pets. This book kind of interested me on behalf of Lennie because he wasn't very intelligent; he was retarted. I recommend this book to any one who is in depth with retarted people. Teaira T."
27264,-1,Not that Great,"If you have any experience with Affiliate programs and/or online marketing, this book was really irrelevant for learning anything new. It's a good introductory book, but that's about the extent of what its good for."
27272,-1,Lame attempt to make a great movie,"I was expecting a lot more out of this movie then what I got.It's basically about a girl who lost her short-term memory in an auto-moblie accident and some guy tries to get her to fall in love with him, yadda, yadda, yadda...There was a lot of jokes that fell flat on their backs' in this movie, after awhile it really begins to annoy you.The acting is nothing great and the diolouge is flat-out horrible.Sandler doesn't give a good performance and Barrymore is okay.Basically, it's a repeatitive movie that delivers lame jokes and the same thing every ten minutes.If you're looking for a good movie, look elsewhere.This is a very lame, unfunny, boring and stupid movie. Save your money for something worthwhile."
27275,-1,What happened?,"I made the mistake of going into this movie with The Wedding Singer in mind. I LOVED that movie, but this one cannot begin to live up to it. What a shame and a waste of time. Appealed to my 14 year old mainly do to the inane one liners and oftenRAW comments. What does the size of the Walrus' member have to do with anything in this movie other than an attempt to add filler to an otherwise dull and overplayed plot."
27289,-1,Don't Believe The Hype,"Aiken's fans have been building up for months about how great and fantastic his CD's going to be and that it'll sell multi-platinum copies, et al. Well, Gold is a more realistic view for the simple fact that his CD is just okay. I heard the whole CD at a ""hear it before you buy it"" music store - and I'm glad I did. I was only impressed by the song that was originally released as a singles i.e., This Is The Night. Well, at least he tried, but I'd just as soon spend my money on Neil Sadaka's Greatest Hits or Country Sensation LeAnn Rhimes upcoming CD."
27296,-1,Darn!,"I really wanted to enjoy this cd, but as many times as I have listened to it......I just cant. Yes, Clay has a good voice, but I hear no emotion in it. Maybe a better choice of songs for his voice would help. I feel, in time, he will mature into a more rounded performer."
27300,-1,Disappointing,"Having watched Clay really get deep in his singing on American Idol, I expected much more from him than he delivers on this CD. The arrangements are weak, his singing is shallow, and the songs all sound the same. For a person of such depth and range in his songs, this is a very poor compilation. I am vastly disappointed."
27302,-1,Disapointing,"Obviously people voted for Clay Aiken based his incredible covers of good songs during the competition, and a teenager wouldn't have been too familiar with alot of those songs because they we're often classic oldies. But for some reason they have decided to make him put out this cd full of the kind of songs that teenagers will probably go for and is nothing like what he had sung to win votes and gain the oppurtunity to make this cd in the first place. So I lost out and I can't understand why they did that. I just hope his next cd has a wider musical range."
27310,-1,Ugh!,"I think it's such a shame that an enormous talent like Clay Aiken is pigeon-hold into making an album like ""Measure Of A Man"". Aiken's voice is soaring and wonderous throughout this disc, but the lyrics and arrangements of each track, excluding ""This Is The Night"" and the title track, are downright insipid. Think Backstreet Boys go Broadway. Clive Davis, the album's head producer is a bonafide hitmaker, but even he has to hang his head in shame at allowing this drivel to be sold to Aiken's fans. From the interviews that I've read and seen on TV featuring him, Clay seems like a decent human being, and has a voice that will mealt your heart. But, I strongly advice any serious music lovers to avoid this disc and wait for something more mature and stronger musically from Clay Aiken the vocal wonder."
27321,-1,"Hun, Clay is sooooo lame","Hun, the CD is nothing special. It is not an essential CD like the Beatles, Supremes, or Aretha. He will be a one CD hit wonder huns."
27323,-1,Not good enough,"Clay Aiken has an outstanding voice, but it isn't showcased here. This is another bland pop CD full of predictable top 40 songs. I wish him all the best, but I certainly hope his next effort will reflect his amazing talent and show more imagination."
27338,-1,the worst thing a musician could be----boring,"Clay Aiken is the kind of polished but staid crooner that fills so many hotel lounges.His voice is absolutely unremarkable, he takes absolutely no risks, and his music absolutely sends me off to sleep.The best word to describe this CD is 'ponderous'. Like any of Clay's songs, its so holier-than-thou it makes you want to gag. At one end you have rap thugs talking about pimps and hos and crack deals and AK 47s, and then this guy comes in from the other side, blindfolded, and then goes on and on about how good and pure and untainted and sweet life is...........Hello Mr Aiken, or should I call you Saint Aiken, do you not see how wicked the world actually is? And you just want to close your eyes and sing all your meaningless sentimental platter to a world that has already seen so much?But enough said. Don't buy this CD. Save your money for some real music."
27343,-1,What's the fuss?,"Invisible is a great song, the best song on the cd. The rest is just blah and sounds the same. Clay has a very nice voice, but this cd is just plain boring. Broadway Clay could never have become a recording artist without the AI hype. He's certainly no Josh Groban, that's for sure."
27355,-1,Stalker Love Ballad?,"""Invisible"" is definitely the creepiest song I have heard on the radio in recent memory. The lyrics seem to describe a stalker. Tell me you aren't weirded out when you hear:""If I was invisible/I could just watch you in your room/If I was invisible/I'd make you mine tonight"" and ""I keep tracing your steps/Each move that you make"". There are definitely some hidden messages running through the background of this song.. Quick! Hide your children!I haven't heard all of the songs on this record, but I have heard many (on the radio, watching Aiken's performance on SNL, etc..), and from them I can deduce that this is yet another generic pop compilation churned out by the bloated record-machine that is American Idol. Clay does have a great voice, though, which is a refreshing change from most of today's pop.Lyrically and musically, I give this cd a 1. Clay's voice brings it up to a 2 1/2, which unfortunately is not an accepted rating."
27362,-1,Next Time Pick Better Songs,"He just had to rush to beat Ruben to a street date, and boy can you tell it. You will be disappointed in these cookie cutter song choices. Clay can sing but I would rather have a cd of the songs he sang on the show, these are really bad. Believe an honest review and not a Clay-fanatic. There are three good songs on the cd (one being the Idol cd single This is The Night). After doing every daytime show, morning show and Jay Leno, he should sell a million copies easy. Remember a million people saw Gigli too. Buyer beware"
27363,-1,Not happy,"The quality of cotton used on this product is not good. It came out of the dryer covered with wrinkles, despite the fact that I dried it on a permanent press+wrinkle guard setting. I must iron it and who wants to iron a t-shirt???? I am very disappointed in the Columbia Sportswear company for putting out such a low-quality product."
27366,-1,OK Toy,"I have to agree with alot of the other posts on this one. Santa brought this for my daughter, who loves teen titans, for Christmas. The instructions, what there is of them, is very hard to decipher. The orange launch thing would not work and I had to take apart the little red switch that the control thing fits on to make the organge track pop out. (the red switch was not in the right position from factory). Even then the orange track does not fold all the way out. Also, like alot of other reviewers the tower tips over very easily. I just don't feel like I am getting what I am paying for these days when it comes to toys."
27367,-1,Falls apart all the time,My son would love this toy if it stayed together. All the parts come off. It is constantly falling a apart and that is not because of rough play. We have even hot glued it together which works for awhile.
27369,-1,Is there oregano in this product?,"Have tried the more expensive product from North American and it cleared up mine and my husband's stuffy noses within 24 hrs. Occasionally you would get a slight after burp with that product. With this product, I've been taking for a week and I still have a stuffy nose and never an after burp. Plus the capsules are huge compared to p73."
27372,-1,Could have been,"A book from the author of Struts, can you possibly go wrong? This book shows you can. The book does not have a flow to it, to me it seems just scattered topics piled on eachother. And then, the grand finale, where all you have ""learned"" is applied in a real world type of thing... By the time it got there, I got so annoyed I did not care anymore. The examples rely on so much non-standard struts stuff, I have trouble with the title even."
27377,-1,Works but HUGE price jump!,"I purchased two of these filters severals months back. And am now seeking to replace my last filter. I agree, the filter does the job; however, I didn't pay $30.00 per filter. Am now considering on trading out my Bosch for a bagless euro shark."
27381,-1,Didn't meet my expectations,"I was soooo looking forward to reading this book but it just didn't do it for me. I was intrigued by the meetings of women of various generations and the Spanish (food) theme--just the right mix for me, so I thought. It just dragged and never made me feel involved or care about the characters. :("
27388,-1,"Eh, why such good reviews?","Another series created out of the idea that a run of the mill dude discovers an alternate world, where he all a sudden becomes courageous and forgets his past. Besides that, the build up of a great magical climax is greatly over hyped, as it falls flat. Dont buy this novel if you are looking for your next great fantasy read"
27390,-1,Worst second season I've even seen,What happened to the writing on this show? Got rid of a great character and actress to replace her with a very unappealing replacement. Plot bounced all over the place.What a disappointment.
27397,-1,"Cute Design, Poor Construction",I bought this bib for my daughter to wear at her ladybug themed 1st birthday. It only lasted a few times after that before it started falling apart.
27398,-1,Puzzling Accounting of Facts,"I am puzzled at why Sampson would set out to deminish Jones and his family. I noted that some of ""his"" facts are actually completely different in other books that are exhaustively researched such as Mark Frost's book The Grand Slam and others I have read including Down the Fairway by Jones himself. Even if everything negative he came up with was true it isn't really very much in light of the great man that he was. He was a man of impeccable character but he was a human being. He was sensitive and conscientious, intellegent, honest and gracious above all.Even so, I enjoy reading anything about Jones which has led to my reading of other books of this era and books about Walter Hagen etc. I enjoyed the pictures."
27399,-1,run 1/2 size small & painful,"I got them in Saddle Croco, which are gorgeous with a good mix of black and brown.I usually wear 6 1/2, thus 7 in Jessica Simpson. They fit ok, but because of the height, I get a bit of room in the back of my heels. Plus they are excruciating, even with Foot Petals Tip Toes."
27401,-1,"I like C-Murder and Mac, but this guy is wack","Silkk might want to consider playing basketball if the continues to make CD's like this. Charge it 2 da game was good , but this is hoorible. The only two tight rappers on No Limit were C-Murder and Mac and they are both locked up. I suppose having guest artists like Trina and Snoop Dogg would make the album better, it does make it better but they can't save it. There are a few decent tracks here. The track with Krazy and C-Murder was good, and the track with Trina was cool too. The problem is, Silkk can't rap. Maybe Soulja Slim will have to lead the label. P and Silkk are not doing too well."
27402,-1,he has not matured as an artist,"After seeing Silkk on 106 and park talking about how he had matured since Made Man, I thought this CD would be philosophical and superior to Made Man. I was wrong, this CD is commercial and offers nothing new. Master P has no creativity and can't rap. ...All in all this CD is quite average and has nothing new to offer. If you really like Silkk, get his first release The Shocker."
27403,-1,Book of Dream By Sylvia Brown,"I ordered three of her books How to contact you Spirit Guide, Life on the Other Side and her book of dreams. The first two were terrific, but the book of dreams is difficult to understand. However, I'm trying to understand. Sylvia is a great Author, who can keep you captivated. I would really like to meet her and learn more about her.M.G.Ebner"
27410,-1,I agree with upgrading to Pro series,"Excellent grating surface. Plastic frame and handle came loose within a few months, then the plastic frame just came apart within a year.I'll be going pro."
27416,-1,Price of < $10 is good but the shirts are thin..,"Though good workmanship, I was expecting a heavier material for this brand name."
27417,-1,Not Impressed,The material is almost see-through and the collar stays are sown into the material. Not really the highest quality although what can you expect for the price?
27426,-1,I did not like this book.,"The book 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was a really disapointing book. Most of the story was boring and not exciting. When it got interesting it just was not as good as other books. I thought this was going to be a good book. The end was the most disapointing part. I would not recommend this book for people my age."
27429,-1,A disappointing read for the 21st century,"This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s, it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many. A ship that could travel under the water! But reading it in 2010, much of the novelty of the book has been realized. We have had submarines for nearly a century.But even aside from that, there is little plot to the novel. It reads as if it were written by a committee at National Geographic. It's a survey of all the unique items and places in the world's oceans. The little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship. And the ending (not to ruin it...) is a total cop-out and disappointing.I was hoping this book would stand the test of time, like The Time Machine or even Around the World in 80 Days. But I found it a rather boring and drudging read."
27433,-1,Short shelf-life!,"I seem to be having the same problem as everyone else. I bought this DSL modem mostly to get UPNP support for my Nintendo Wii. Worked great for the first 6 months, but I noticed lately it can't connect to the DSL provider or when it does everything crawls and eventually it looses sync. Sadly, I had to replace it with my old DSL modem (SpeedStream) which works perfectly (so I know its not my phone lines or other problems). Also, I noticed the Zoom DSL modem heats up pretty bad, wondering if theres a connection between that and its failure rate.I would definitely find another DSL modem, especially after reading all the other posts regarding the poor reliability issues."
27439,-1,"Yadda, yadda, yadda!","If you took out every comment by cast, writers and producers on trying (unsuccessfully)to figure out Lorne Michaels, this heavy tome would easily be cut in half. Too much whining, too little interesting, historical information for me, a long time fan of the show."
27441,-1,Two Days I'll Never Get Back,"Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller seemingly provided an opportunity for free therapy sessions to all former and current SNL staffers. The whining, moaning and venting about how hard their lives are is more laughable than most of the SNL skits they've ever performed in.The book provided nothing interesting in how the show actually operates. Sniping at one another seems to be the only reason for most cast member to even agree to be interviewed for the book. Missed opportunities by not interviewing lesser cast members (though they might have turned down the authors) could have painted a complete other picture.The special on Biography (on A&E) was more interesting than this book - and was only an hour. Catch that instead."
27449,-1,A disappointment and where is the book?,"I thought ""The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" was brilliant. I could not wait for this movie to be released in theatres. I waited two and a half years for this film and I was disappointed. I thought that there was hardly anything from the book at all. There was way too many things added in this film like the battle at Miraz's Castle, Susan and Caspian being in love, and the White Witch almost coming back to life. None of those things happened in the book. In the last movie at least they tried hard to stick to the book, but in this film it seemed like there was no effort for that at all. I also did not like the addition of certain creatures like the giant walking trees. If you have not read any of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" books, then maybe you will like this movie, but if you love the books you may not like this film at all."
27453,-1,Disappointed,"I waited anxiously and patiently for the video release of Prince Caspian. As someone who has read the whole Narnia series, I was greatly disappointed in this movie. Yeah the special affects were cool, and most kids will probably like the movie. But this movie deviates so far from the original book that it would be easier to list the similarities between the two. Anyone who is a fan of C.S. Lewis' books should not waste their time seeing this."
27454,-1,the chronicles of cash cow narnia,"Caspian lacks the heart and charm of Lion, Witch, Wardrobe. It felt stale, confusing and similar to the first film, full of dazzling critters rushing head first into another battle to save some ancient kingdom or whatever. It had been almost twenty-five years since I'd read Caspian, so I didn't remember the story. I had a hard time understanding the time frame relative to LWW. I wonder how they're going to gloss over The Horse and His Boy, that one sucked."
27469,-1,I'm left feeling sour...,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book! It was quick paced and gripping. The problem was when I put it down... I felt sour -- like I'd been cooped up on a mountain with a bunch of bumbling idiots for three weeks... That was what stuck with me... Could that have been the whole point of the book??? To convey that??? Wasn't there something more important to convey? Like Kocour's experience with the mountain, or more importantly, with herself? I wonder if she feels sour, still..."
27470,-1,Laughing Aloud: One Reader's Story of True Hilarity and Boredom-Defying Perusal in the Face of Denali's Silliest Story Ever!,"The more you know about mountaineering, the funnier you'll find this book. There is little to like, but much to laugh at in Ruth Ann's utterly unselfconscious self-portrait.If this were a comic novel it would be a dead-on parody of a certain strain of self-glorifying mountaineering literature. Think Nicholson Baker writing ""Into Thin Air"" from the point of view of Sandy Hill Pittman. And it starts with the twenty-two-word long title!Warning: if you're not in the mood to laugh, be prepared to be annoyed!"
27474,-1,couldn't finish it,"As a redhead, I bought this book hoping to get some coherent info about redheads throughout history. Honestly, I put the book down a while ago and haven't been able to pick it back up. There's something about the way that Ms. Roach writes that feels like eating cotton candy all day - it's vacuous without much substance. She flows into tangent after tangent, with moments of wit, and then fails to deliver any ""final knowledge.""As far as any allegations of an anti-christian nature to the book, well, it's called superstition, and christians weren't exempt from that, however much they would try to deny it. Ms. Roach does discuss witch meetings, so if you're threatened by that, stay away.Overall, not worth the money."
27480,-1,Remarkably lacking in content...,"This books presents itself as a helpful guide to programmers, promoters, and everyday jocks for programming improvement. Surprisingly, the book was primarily based on author Quincy McCoy's own journey through the ranks in radio and his personal trials along the way. McCoy's story, albeit a testament of his talent, unfortunately lacks a great deal of content for those who are looking for a ""book of good radio ideas"". A better choice for today's programming staff, in more encyclopedic form and coming from another radio guru, isRadio: The Book, Fourth Editionby Steve Warren."
27488,-1,An antique curiosity,"Forester's day has come and gone. This book is interesting to read from a historical perspective but has little practical value in the second decade of the 21st century.Newbies who need real world information about transportation cycling should start their quests elsewhere and save their money.Forester spends many pages stuck in boring old git mode. I am from the same generation as JF and even I find him often insufferable.His over the top, my way or the highway opinions are largely unhelpful to novice knowledge seekers, IMHO."
27491,-1,Not what you expect,"I went into buying this eight DVD box set believing that there would be at least a few classic ""Stooges"" shorts. Instead, I receive only ONE DVD of shorts, the rest of the set being comprised of various clips, biographies, and rare footage of the Howard brothers. I'm all for learning a bit about our classic comedy heritage here, but my main complaint is that the clips on each DVD borrow greatly from each other (you'll find yourself watching one DVD, realizing you've seen these clips on the LAST DVD!), the clips are poorly edited together, and there are far too many annoying ""Pop-up Video""-esque factoids that are indeed informative, but get in the way of enjoying the Stooges' comedy.If you're interested in learning about the team here, read a biography. If you want to actually WATCH the Stooges, try a different box set."
27494,-1,Simply NOT that good.,"I really wanted this to be a better book, especially when faced with all the ""Wait until you get to the TWIST!"" comments I had heard. Um, well, I assumed what the ""TWIST"" was about 10 pages into the book.Great idea, just overwrought prose and not nearly creepy enough."
27495,-1,Made my foot hurt,"I used this product for about a week and a half then decided to stop using it. At first I had the straps adjusted too tight which made my foot and leg hurt from squeezing too much. Then I loosened them and thought it would be better but my foot hurt so much that I would wake up about 3AM in pain and would have to take it off and the sound of velcro peeling away at 3AM also wakes up the person beside you too. When you lay down your foot naturally wants to turn to the side and with this brace on, it put pressure against the side of my foot which was tolarable for a few hours but then it would really start hurting where the strap went around my foot. If I kept my foot pointed straght up then it did not pull but that isn't how my foot is naturally positioned when I sleep. It's a little pricy for what it actually is."
27499,-1,Save Yourself Six Bucks,"Here's an alternative: Tell the missionaries ""Come on in. I'll listen to your story, think about it, and decide for myself.""Then contemplate your beliefs at Taco Bell, over six bucks' worth of ChocoTacos.A much better use of your cash"
27504,-1,Intriguing Plot.....,"But at some points there is just way to much to take in. Although the plot is very interesting and the characters and scene are well developed, you have to be very dedicated to reading this novel. In some sections it can be very difficult to understand what is going on at all. Unless you are prepared to read pages over and over again, you may want to try something else."
27505,-1,What's Going on Here?,"This is the kind of record that gives jazz a bad name. Russell Gunn, a young trumpeter of note, here offers a set of mostly bebop chestnuts supposedly given a fresh reading. Instead, what we get is esoteric, virtuoso, insider treatments. Yes, there are some stunning moments, yes, the fine assemblage of 20- and 30-something jazzers play their butts off, but it generally comes across as cold and academic: ideosyncratic, listener-unfriendly set-pieces. Where's the warmth, the vitality, the craziness that make jazz such a surprizing and engaging music? Not here on this disc, I'm sorry to say."
27508,-1,"Product is great, wrong amazon description.","This case was titled as a compact bow case for bow's 43"" long however at the time of purchase the description stated it would fit a 49"" bow. Fast shipping and technically sent the right case per title but was described incorrectly so I had to send it back and I bought it from Cabella's trusting their description."
27509,-1,Nowhere near Simpsons highlights,"Unfortunately these episodes date from the first 2 series, which were nowhere near as clever, inventive, subtle and hysterical as the later episodes. I really wouldn't bracket any of these as SImpsons classics, having seen maybe 200 episodes. 2 Cars In Every Garage is probably the best, marking the first appearance of a 3-eyed fish (a great insight into the surreal humour of the show's authors). Treehouse Of Horror was stylish and also very surreal, especially the first part. Bart Vs Thanksgiving, and Bart gets an F to an extent, falls into the pigeonhole of early episodes characterised by Bart doing somethig 'bad' (and personally I prefer seeing Homer be stupid) and neither are all that engaging, otehr than the superbly constructed Snow Day scenes. I wouldn't bother with this one."
27510,-1,"""confused""",I didn't see the logic behind this garment. It's suppose to hold in the belly but yet there's a little opening at the bottom where my belly sticks out from. I sent this back and got the bottomless one. I love that one i have been wearing that one for years.
27511,-1,"Brenda, B",This is a good ideal but you need to be measures for the right size.I have order the 2xx and it was to little and I order the 3xx and the legs or the bottom part was to big. But I have the Squeem Rubber High Back Waist Cincher Girdle Style 26J in 2xx and it fitted well.
27521,-1,I Didn't really like the book,It was a Ok book not the best close to the worst the school made us read it it might of been better if we weren't forced to read it
27533,-1,Not satisfied.,"We purchased this microwave in October for $300 minus the $50 rebate. Panasonic denied our first rebate submission, claiming we'd bought the wrong item. A phone call cleared up the misunderstanding and apparently our rebate is on its way. However, I've since been told that rebate problems and denials are a common occurrence with Panasonic.The microwave has a nice appearance and functions well. However, there is a significant design flaw. You cannot use the hood light as a nightlight or even keep it on for very long without heating up the inside of the microwave to the point where the internal fan comes on and the microwave will not turn on to cook. After the oven cools down, it seems to function normally. The first time this happened, the inside of the oven was so hot I thought it was a short circuit. For that reason, I do not recommend buying this appliance. I wonder if this is why the price has dropped dramatically..."
27535,-1,Very disappointed!!,"I didn't like the workout, Donna's teaching style and some of the music that was played in the background. She talks way too much. It only got my heart rate up very little. The workout was not fun at all! Save your money and invest in Tamilee's Tighter Assets or her ""I want that"" series. It is a much better investment."
27537,-1,Dissapointed,"the first track is an edited version of 'Natural Blues', track 8 on play, and this version trims it down, and removes some of the bet parts of the song, it's like taking the soul out of music. I didn't like how they edited that track. Track 2, 'The Whispering Wind' seems very sad, but it gets boring after a while, and the way moby edited his voice on that gets annoying after a while.Track 3, 'Sick In The System' seemed odd for this single, but the song in itself i enjoyed the most out of all of the tracks on this cd."
27550,-1,A great disapointment,"Rather than letting his subjects tell their stories Brokaw interjects his politics and philosophy. I donated my copy to the city library. Instead, read Studs Terkel's ""The Good War."" It ""is"" what Brokaw could have ""had"", if he would have imitated the master oral biographer."
27555,-1,Big disappointment,"This book is mainly about Brokaw's love for Republican politicians who served in World War Two, and little else. The average GI doesn't seem to matter here. There are some interesting parts, such as how black veterans were treated, but all in all, this book fails miserably."
27561,-1,DISAPPOINTED,I had high hopes for this very worthwhile topic. Reads like Mr. Brokaw is presenting a report on the late news. I expected a more developed presentation.
27568,-1,A talking head doesn't equal a writing head.,"Big disappointment. I saw Brokaw on the talk shows and had high hopes for The Greatest Generation. But the author's dry, uninspired writing style made reading more chore than pleasure. I soon found myself skimming. I can recall only a few of the chapters. As a more readable subsitute, I recommend the similar book by Studs Turkel called, I think, The Good War. It was told in the words of the subjects themselves."
27570,-1,Brokaw is better on television.,"The Greatest Generation is pretty good, considering. I mean what can one really expect by way of literature from over paid, telegenic, media stars? I enjoyed the references to Howard Stern. Too bad Brokaw didn't give Stern his own chapter. The book reminded me of Getting To Howard: The Odyssey of an Obsessed Howard Stern Fan. Now that's a great book. Sort of like Tolstoy meets Dr. Seuss."
27576,-1,Brokaw's not so in-depth look at WWII generation,"Being a WWII buff, when I heard about this book I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. However, shortly after reading the first few stories, I was deeply disappointed. I have utterly lost all respect for Mr. Brocaw's journalistic ability. The book is simplistic (written at about an 8th grade level), repetitive and boring. It feels more like an article from People Magazine than any sort of historical record or work of literature. Devoid of facts and details, it contains very little of anything else.The generation he is writing about deserves a better tribute than this. I suppose it is to be expected that a member of the info-tainment industry would write something with such little substance. I used to be a loyal viewer of NBC News, I think I'll switch that loyalty to Jim Lehrer and PBS."
27578,-1,You missed the point Tom,"This book does an admirable job of describing the great accomplishments of the WW2 generation. Many people with little preparation became heroes or millionaires. But to call them the 'Greatest Generation' totally misses the point on what it takes to make one great. It isn't just great accomplishments, it's having great values - and passing these on to your children so that when you're gone the world is a better place. Look at the children neglected while their mothers work. Look at the skyrocketing national debt. Look at the social security debacle. The 'Greatest Generation' passed all these on to us to solve.Look around Tom... they were a major failure."
27579,-1,Reads like a high school English project,"""The Greatest Generation"" reminds me of biographies printed for class reunions or interviews published in a small town newspaper. In ""The Greatest Generation"" Tom Brokaw profiles dozens of people who served their country during World War II.Most of the profiles follow the template of: X did this during the war, X had this memory of the war, X married Y and they had these children, the war changed X in this manner, this is how X's family think the war influenced X, this is why X's friend or co-worker thinks X is a great person, and this is what X thinks of the generations to follow.Using this formula made it easy for Brokaw to do three to ten page bios on the people he met. The profiles all seem generic after awhile. The book packs very little emotional impact perhaps because it is written in an overly sentimental manner. There are very few interesting stories or anecdotes for a book that goes over 400 pages.I expected something better from Tom Brokaw."
27580,-1,A long thank you,"This book is in a real sense a long and general thank you letter to a generation. While the flavor of appreciation comes across as very real in this book I was hoping for a more acedemic and researched direction. I was dissapointed. The generation of the 40's deserves this book for the gratitude that it heaps on them, though I don't agree they are quite the saints as they are protrayed. Not much substance...Please some historian/writer follow the idea and write a proper book!"
27589,-1,Technical Analysis of stock trends is a tiring book.,"BORING. I started to read about the Dow Theory with old fashioned charts of defunct stocks. There are supplements to the text to bring in modern stocks, but maybe one should retire this book."
27591,-1,"Big fan of Adams, but this book ...","I am a big fan of Dougles Adams books, at least in general.But this book is, at best, only marginally funny. Others have explored this topic, and with better results.The problem here is that Adams tries to make funny sounding words for things that don't have a name (like that little twist between link sausages), but constrains himself to using the names of small cities and towns from around the world. Occasionally, he hits a home run, but most of the words are strike outs.Disapointed.PS the 'name' for the link between sausages is kerry. Why, I don't know, and I have no idea why some think this is humorous."
27592,-1,pointless.,"Unlike Adams' other works, this provides no satire, and very very little humor. The entire purpose of the book is to identify cities and towns whose names do not obviously make sense, redefine the name as a noun and bestow upon it a nonsensical definition. The only reason I didn't rate it a one or half star, is because it wasn't offensive, aside from the $8 lost."
27620,-1,Pan is all scratched after 3 months,"I bought this rice cooker 3 months ago and was very careful to only use the white spoon provided to remove rice/porridge. I only used soft cloth to wash the pan and no dishwasher.However, after 3 months of use, the pan is scratched pretty badly and the coating is coming off. Not sure if I can replace it."
27626,-1,need very long time to cook,Unless you have soemone at home to press it one hour before meal. Otherwise it takes at least 40 minutes to make rice ready. It is not good for both those couples without enough time for cooking. It take 1 hour and 30 minutes for stick rice. which is crazy for me....
27634,-1,Never got round,"My wife loves this ball. She likes its color and thinks it is very sturdy. I, however, think that we have a defective ball. No matter how de/inflated I make the ball, it never becomes a sphere. With the help of a bicycle pump and the enclosed plastic tip I was able to inflate the ball to its recommended 65cm ( I used a tailors tape to measure), but I was far from round. The ball has three 'lobes'. I've read great things about GoFit, so this is probably an anomaly. I would have returned, but my wife doesn't mind."
27652,-1,Not for an Outback Wagon,"I've seen this on trunklids, with bikes or without: appears sturdy and appropriate. Fine.As for use at the back of a wagon, specifically an Outback, it simply doesn't fit. The side straps don't grab at a good angle because of the interior plastic connected to the hatch. The top straps can't get an easy grab on the metal (even with recommended $20 extra) without bending and threatening to break the back-up light assembly which are positioned above the rear glass.If you have an Outback, go for a roof rack solution, or spend the $ on a trailer hitch, I suppose."
27661,-1,Jessex is a bore... both as a character and a narrator...,"You'd think a 15 year old faced with being the salvation of an immortal king, the keystone of an army of thousands and integral the future of the entire world would be overwhelmed, frightened, excited, disbelieving, in awe-- but Jessex, the protaganist of this novel is about as wooden as he is perfect. And Oh, is he ever perfect. Jessex has none of the frailty or humanity we've come to expect from even the cheapest dime-store fantasy novels. As a result, the book is a near complete loss... I truly pity Kirith Kirin, facing the prospect of several lifetimes with someone so completely uninteresting."
27662,-1,bing crosby,"This dvd is hard to find. Unfortunately it is a poor quality. The picture is fuzzy. However, if you enjoyed the movie, then you will enjoy this until a better one comes along"
27677,-1,IT IS WHAT IT IS!,"I don't know what i'm doing rating a spong bob movie. let me say it was a complete disappointment, and boring. but then i remember this is exactly what its supposed to be, a kids cartoon. not an anime for late night airing. buy it for the kids, if your an adult fan, then skip buying, and renting. we realy don't need to watch sponge bob ""grow up."""
27687,-1,Men's heatgear compression shortsleeve T-shirt,"I did not expect this top to be skin tight. The other Armour exercise shirt I have is a comfortable fit. It is partly my own fault because I did not realize the significance of ""compression"" fit."
27691,-1,Expectations too high?,"I guess I am guilty of having too high an expectation, or maybe just stubborn hair. Either way I am not impressed. I still have to tweeze after using the strips. I made the initial mistake of trying to use the stipps repeatedly on the same area when the the strips didn't get it all the first time....big mistake. I'll use them to do an overall, but tweezing is still necessary.Maybe I just didn't hold my mouth right..."
27693,-1,Not the 2 short album to start with,"Suprised with all the positive reviews for this album, since this is one of Too Short's weaker albums. There are a few enjoyable tracks here, but nothing to write home about. ""Shorty the Pimp"" and ""Get in where you fit in"" are so much stronger, that this I wouldnt bother with this one."
27705,-1,Aaaaaaak!!!! It's Dracula's Dog!!!,"I have the movie version of Dracula's Dog. I find it hard to believe that this story was actually in book AND movie form...hum.Anyway, my cousin bought this movie for me as a joke. How funny is it that there was actually a movie made called Dracula's Dog!? The funniest part is that the movie is supposed to be serious. The movie is soooooooo bad it's actually entertaining. I just can't believe I'm the first person to review this movie; hasn't everyone been haunted by Dracula's Dog?"
27709,-1,1,"ive bought some cheap and bad games in my day but wow! really, this is the crappiest game i have ever bought. i finished it but was contastantly reminded how lame the gameplay was ALL THE WAY through the game. if you want to try a cheap game like this one that is good, get conan for a few bucks."
27710,-1,Pretty and very BORING!,"WOW! I was hoping this game wouldn't be as bad as people said. It really sucks! No fun at all. Pretty to look at on my 1080p-but that's it. Fun-factor = 3/10 Glad I only paid 37.00 for it. In a nutshell, if you're under 15 yrs old, you will love this game! If not, spit on it. What a waste."
27719,-1,Boring,"After purchasing this for our home library, I couldn't wait to read it before my children did. I was bored and unenthused throughout the reading. The author made great attempts at historical accuracy, just not enough with character or plot development. The story must have been born of facts first, as the characters just seemed thrown about and inconsistent. Along with the lack of plot, those inconsistencies are what make this a brutal read. I can't imagine either of my young avid readers enjoying this book and all its predictabilities."
27723,-1,An interesting but predictible book,"This book was semi interesting. I liked certain parts, but compared to other books, this one was too predictible. I prefered the book, Beyond the Burning Time. Not only was it better, it was less predictable and more interesting! But read the two books for yourself and you can decide!"
27725,-1,Tiki's Total Review Page,I enjoyed this book mainly because it is a Historical fiction novel. I think this book would be a good reading source for anyone between the ages of 11-13 because it has alot to teach about life in the 1800's while letting you read a facinating story about a girl and the troubles she goes through after she moves away from her home in Barbados to her uncles home in New England. I think the auther needs some more detail in her writting as to create a more vivid picture of the senery. I think that it would be wonderful if this story could have a sequel to it because like all books it cuts of into ablivion.
27734,-1,Wake Me Up Please...,"I want to start out by stating the fact, I love Oasis. Be Here Now is a major disappointment from this sometimes brilliant band.Hype is what drove this band into the spotlight. When you have everbodys attention, you HAVE to perform well.What's The Story Morning Glory was released and it seemed anyone with a good trained ear for pure pop music was licking their chops.Then this yawn of an album was released and it seemed to take a lot of the air out of Oasis' balloon. Believe me, it's not a BAD album, it's just .....boring. Nothing jumps out at you making you want more. A lot of these songs sound like leftovers from other albums.I think that if this album actually kicked some butt, and had the catchy tunes like the ones on ""Morning Glory"" , Oasis would be #1.(not touring and sharing a bill with the Black Crows). I love you guys, you pump out some great tunes, but this is rubbish simply put."
27742,-1,"good story, weak character development","It's an interesting story, and he describes the martian flora and fauna very well, but there are some things that are glossed over (like what happened in the cave) and the only character that is explored with any depth is Jon Carter."
27743,-1,Not a Little Boy,"""A Princess of Mars"" reads like a superhero comix. John Carter, a warrior on Earth, becomes a super-warrior on Mars because he weighs less there. He conquers aliens, wins the heart of a princess, and fathers an egg with her. As a fantasy for little boys, it's great. As literature for an adult woman, I'd give it a miss."
27745,-1,A PRINCESS OF MARS,I ENJOYED THE BOOK VERY MUCH. IT WAS WELL SPACED AND EASY FOR AN ELDERLY PERSON TO READ. THE ONLY FAULT I FIND IS I THOUGHT I WOULD RECEIVE THE DUST COVER AS SHOWN IN THE ADD.I TRIED TO BE CAREFUL IN READING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BOOK AND WAS SURE THAT IT CAME AS IT WAS PICTURED IN THE ADD.
27750,-1,Smaller than I thought,"Before you buy this, measure out 20 oz because it was way smaller than I thought it would be. Also, after washing this a few times, it developed a small spot of rust where the handle attaches to the pitcher. I thought stainless steel did not rust so I returned the pitcher."
27751,-1,Primarily for Ned Oldham fans,Ned Oldham has been popping-up as a musician/background vocalist on Will Oldham/Palace records for some time now. Beware - this album portrays an opposite relationship. It is primarily a Ned Oldham record with a very occasional insertion of Will's voice mixed in the background. If you want to hear Will's voice - do not waste your money unless you're a completist.
27760,-1,LCD had problems displaying after 10 months.,"this clock looks pretty cool but the quality needs to be improved. it's absolutely not worth of $$.i bought one with an AC adapter last year which cost me $$ more. i like the LCD to constantly show the time at night so i didn't care the extra $$.it took a long time to receive the radio signal from Coloroda. but it was pretty easy setting the calendar, date, day, time and alarm. i was very happy about it until this February. the LCD suddenly went partially blank. i wouldn't even guess what time it was showing. i thought the batteries ran out so i replaced with a new pair. yet it still couldn't display the time properly and the LCD turned totally blank in a day."
27764,-1,Not what I was hoping for,"This video is fine if you are looking for help with form and stretching exercises. I was hoping for more about the ""chi"" of running, and ""chi"" in general. I love the bits I have read about Chi Running, but I wish this was a video of the material in the book. Then maybe I wouldn't feel guilty when I see the book on my shelf (mostly) unread. I'm hoping there will be an audio version in the future."
27765,-1,"Chi-Running, more like cha-ching running","I am a running coach and had heard all the hype about this book so I felt compelled to buy it. At the end of the day, the information was not nearly as useful or revolutionary as the hype suggests. What it is, is merely a copy cat of ""Pose running"" with Ti-Chi attached.Now I don't have a problem with Ti-Chi, I just think it was the ""juice"" to sensationalize a system of running that is already in play. Well written, not much to argue with, I just was hoping for a bit more unique factor from the author which I did not find."
27766,-1,If you want straight biomechanical and physiological advice.,"...then get Programmed to Run by Miller or Efficient Running by Cady. One has a PhD in exercise science and the other has a Master's degree in physical therapy. No spiritual advice, just sound physics, research, and observations of elite runners."
27767,-1,Audio CD is seriously abridged.,"The Audio CD is ""abridged"". What a joke! It is only a bit over 3 hours of audio on 3 cd's. It appears the author talks about Chi Running rather than reading from the book.If you have the ability to read and are interested in the book, buy the book instead.Listening to this is like listening the the author give a speech about chi running or an informative podcast about Chi Running. It's interesting and informative, but it isn't listening to the book as written. In fact, I can't believe this counts as an audio ""book""."
27768,-1,NY MEM.,I THINK THAT THIS WAS THE WRONG TYPE OF MUSIC FOR RIEU. THE FIRST DISSAPPOINTMENT WITH HIS ALBUMS.
27771,-1,Wha?,"I don't get this CD. I listened to it, listened to it again, chased my cat, cheeseyfranks, with a Salisbury steak TV dinner, listened to it again and nope, nothing. It's more average rock by bands that Mark Knopfler should put over his knee and whoop with a copy of Procol Harum's Las Vegas comeback effort. It's junk. Kroll was all about Sparta about 6 months ago before a telemarketer talked him into some psychic network. He now tells me that my oatmeal may jump up and start singing showtunes if my aura is not in line. Anyway, Sparta is a waste of time only Saved by the Bell, the pre school years, can compete with."
27774,-1,Product may be spoiled...hit or miss.,"I had no issues with my initial order. The first box was 100% useable, so I went ahead and ordered two more. What a waste! Second box had 4 bad tablets...ok, not so good but I overlooked it. Last box: about one out of three effervescent tablets were spoiled, and by spoiled, I mean there was either a brown smelly and badly decomposed tablet or some nasty rotten black goo in each of the packets. I can't speak to the effectiveness of this product yet, but I was hoping that it would at least be useable! Bad batch perhaps, but TWO boxes!? Unfortunately, I missed the product return deadline by less than two weeks because I didn't discover the bad tablets in time."
27775,-1,Unimpressive and unhelpful,"I purchased this book to help me with ideas for homeschooling my children. This book is the longest in my collection but it is the least informative. The first 100 pages or so deride the current efforts of public schools, yet offer little advice except ""turn off the television"" and ""read to your children"". The most interesting and helpful information in the book was taken directly from the Core Curriculum Series, which is a useful resource for parents who want to ensure that their child is receiving a good education. This book is preachy and redundant."
27776,-1,A good yarn,A reasonable read. Good story line although I expected it to be about captain cochrane himself. Worth a look at.
27782,-1,Doesn't Work!,"For all the famous names in this movie, soomething better should have come out of it. It was predictable from the first, and the twists and turns were just silly. They couldn't leave the estate, although one of them managed to arrive from the outside. Just about every one was involved in something illicit, or at least in something strange. Lovers were talked about but not really discussed. The biggest bombshell involving supposed incest was discussed by just two of the eight and nothing was made of it. This movie was just an unrelated bunch of snippets that just doesn't work."
27783,-1,we were soldiers original motion picture score,i bought this cd for one song on it sgt. mackenzie and i was disappoint that the it was broken up into three parts on the cd
27784,-1,We Were Solidiers,"Loved the movie, love the music. However, there are 17 tracks with different titles but the song is the same on each one. Very disappointing."
27785,-1,HARD!,"I'm a good hoola hooper, but when it comes to the super advanced stuff that they are doing..NO WAY! Popped it into my dvd player once, I don't even know where it is now. I was so hard!"
27788,-1,Defective Plastic,My Bose headphones are extremely lightly used. This is the second time the plastic has broken on the headphones. My husband has had to duck tape them. Bose wants to charge me $100 to replace their defective product.
27792,-1,Wait for the better version,"Bose is supposed to have a good reputation in innovative audio technology. But, this attempt at ""Acoustic Noise Cancelling"" is a misnomer, in fact, plain misleading. It may reduce some engine noise in the plane, but you hear everything else, including screaming chidren and chatty passengers. The idea is good, but the technology is nowhere there. I'm returning mine back."
27795,-1,"Fragile - suitable only for the Bubble-Boy, not frequent flyers","I am on my second pair of Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones - and like so many in the other reviews here both mine broke. The first time they broke I paid $100 for a replacement pair, and the replacement then started to crack in the same place as my first pair! So I quickly pulled out the black electrical tape and effected a repair before they completely broke again. My self-back-patting was shortlived however when they broke completely at the swivel joint, while I was wearing them. I treated these headphones with the utmost care and they still broke. I fly a lot and the noise cancelling really helps reduce the fatigue from the engine roar so I will try another manufacturer, probably Sennheiser. I always found the sound quality to fine, not great but when you're on an aircraft you don't expect much. But I do expect something that costs $300 to be able to stand up to the rigours of everyday life."
27798,-1,poor quality.,"I sent this set back within seconds of inspection. The corners were already dented, the glue holding the thin felt in place on the sides and corners had already failed. I went to my nearby store and purchased a much higher quality set for the same money. this is not a good set for any serious backgammon player."
27817,-1,Poor Streaming,"Movie was great! The Amazon streaming was horrible. Several times the movie would stop to buffer but wouldn't restart on it's own. Several times we had back up and and restart the movie. Picture quality was good but streaming compared to NetFlix, Hulu etc. Amazon has a long ways to go before I'll buy another movie through your system."
27823,-1,Ninja Batman????,"Bruce Wayne trained as a ninja? He could single-handedly defeat all the other ninjas, including his mentors? He got all his weapons and gadgets from an inventor in his late father's company? Where did he park his batmobile when he was fighting thugs and rescuing his girlfriend? How did he drive the batmobile there without being noticed in the first place? The ninjas were going to kill him, but when the giant beam fell on him, they just left him alone, to be rescued by the butler???They tried to fit all the pieces in, but ended up leaving too many holes."
27825,-1,Blank- Man Begins,"Batman Begins would've been a better movie had it been it's own original character. Although comical at times and the constant changing lead actors playing Batman (i.e. Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer & George Clooney), the consistency was there. Batman Begins and doesn't quite offer an insight as to what you're watching. Is he in Tibet? Okay, halfway in you find out why he was locked up. Batman Begins tried to be darker than it was. The unimpressive BatMobile (Hummer, dune buggie dragster fusion). Maybe the new generation of kids will enjoy this. But as a new twist on Batman, 2 stars. As a standalone hero, Begins would deserve maybe 4 stars."
27826,-1,BATMAN BEGINS blue-ray DVD (SPECIAL FEATURES),"The movie is great, that's why i bought the movie, but i also wanted to see all the special features, that's the reason i bought it a blue-ray dvd for this movie.Unfortunately a lot of these special features are not working. They appear in the special features menu screen, but when i press their link, the dvd tries to load the segment, but then it returns to the disc menu screen with out showing the short. It happens with the following special features: Batman-The Journey Begins, Shaping Mind and Body, Gotham City Rises, Cape and Cowl, Batman-The Tumbler, Path to Discovery, Saving Gotham City. Other features such as The Dark Knight IMAX Prologue, Digital Batman work fine.It is a shame that most of the special features do not work, i am dissappointed with the quality of this product."
27835,-1,"Dreadful Quality, like all the Bob playsets","We have the Bob Toolbox playset, and it is junk, too. The only good thing about this set is that you get Bob and Wendy, and at least they don't break. If your little one likes Thomas the Tank Engine, buy those playsets instead. They are so much better made that it is ridiculous. They cost a bit less, too. The take along Bob vehicles are nice, but the larger talking vehicles, junk as well! My four year old loves his Bob the builder toys, but they are a huge pain because the design and quality are shoddy. You do need to know that before you buy. These are not toys you can set up and feel confident that they will get hours of trouble free play. The pieces fall off, some of the pieces do not fit properly. It is annoying, but kids love it."
27845,-1,I don't know what this book 's target is.,"I have finished this book with only 2.5 days.I feel very disapointed because this book mainly tell you what the features are avaliable in the Small Business Server 2000.This book hasn't tell you how to use them, how to deploy them.The style of the book is many titles in a chapter, but there is only a few words talking the title.I feel that the author is saying like ""There is Remote Access Service with SBS 2000. Then bye bye.""This book is too details for manager/decision maker, but not enough for administrator, so I don't know what this book for."
27846,-1,No Substance,"I was expecting something similar to Office 2000 Resource Kit, a very good resource. but instead this book is not at all helpful for anyone who has never installed a server product before or been exposed to network issue decisions. Luckily I come from a Unix/Linux background and could understand the jargon and over emphasized subjects covered in this book. Active Directory is nothing more then an overblown address book (however, it is most useful) it's coverage is overdone in my opinion. Save your money and use the Server help documentation that comes with the product."
27847,-1,Good thing that I didn't rush out and buy the DVD version...,"Thinking that I was missing out on a new release of vintage James Brown,I am so glad that I didn't buy the DVD-Body Heat because I already have the VHS, ""James Brown, the Lost Tapes"". I would have been upset to learn that the DVD is the same as the tape. I am constantly looking for new unseen performance material from Mr. Brown while he was in his hey-days, the 60'and 70's."
27849,-1,Other reviews not helpful,"The weights in my old weight vest have started to desintegrate so it was time for a new one. The price is right and other reviews were very positive. On reviewer who said she was 5'2"" found it too short. I did not think this would be a problem for me because I am considerably taller, 5'7"". However it is too long...sits on the hips rather than hanging from the shoulders and ending at the waist line like my old one does. I do not think it will be very comfortable so I am sending it back. Also, I thought the illustration I looked at showed it as black. It is white, not attractive (How attractive can a weight vest be?) and will probably look dirty very soon and have to be laundered a lot."
27855,-1,"Great film, bad print","This is an historic film version, but the print I just purchased from Amazon is of very poor quality. If you go to Netflix, a much better print can be viewed streaming (and it's free to Netflix subscribers). This version for sale on Amazon should be retired. Amazon, please do something!"
27857,-1,This is the kind of piece that makes people think that they don't like Shakespeare,"This play is so much fun, but you wouldn't know it from this static, phoned-in production. There are some good actors here, but it feels as if someone said, ""You're acting in film, so just pull it way back."" Dull, lifeless. Find the very fun 1968 RSC film version directed by Peter Hall (also with Mirren, but this time as Hermia) and see that instead.Beware: Several reviews here of this version are from reviewers who didn't watch it, but saw Mirren's name, and assumed it to be their beloved 1968 RSC production. It's not."
27865,-1,STRUGGLE OF WOMEN,"I was disappointed in this book. I am searching for a book that is equally as awesome as 'A Virtuous Woman', but it looks like Kaye Gibbons isn't going to give it to us. In this book the women are survivors because they have to be. I was disappointed in the cold, compassionless character of Charlie Kate. Her character shined through her words and actions: beneath that arrogant surface lay a very insecure, unsatisfied, unfulfilled, and angry person. I can understand why she didn't have a man: who would want her? Her hatred of men, I think, was more of a jealousy. She had no compassion, so she tried to make up for it in her 'intelligence' and 'literacy'. She tried to hide behind those midwife skills. Although the book was long, it was shallow and I expected a deeper plot."
27868,-1,I'm clearly missing something here,"Not being a woman, or a midwife, or a semi-witch, or a southerner, I'm sure I missed something about this book. It wasn't necessarily bad - I can appreciate the craftsmanship of the text - it just really didn't speak to me on a personal level. Still, not a bad read for a rainy afternoon."
27882,-1,burned up after touching it with my hand,purchased two of these. one unit worked good for about an hour the static electricity made it go up in flames. the second unit will only produce sound from the left or right channel at different levels. it will not balance out even with the balance nob.
27883,-1,i have question,"i was wondering if anyone else who has purchased this amp is having the same problem as me. i am using an old advent 300 as the pre-amp. the souce is either a laptop or mp3 player. at the beginning of a song or when the music is slightly muted the amp kicks off, the music stops. it's very irritating because it give the music a halting quality. when it's picking up the music it sounds great....but i can't listen to it when it's doing this. i am not an audiphile so it maybe something in the setup but it seemed pretty straight forward. thanks for any input."
27886,-1,Too difficult,"For trying to be a popular exposition on mathematics Devlin's book is too difficult for the lay reader. Unless you have university level mathematics in your luggage you won't understand much. The explanations of basic conepts are missing, the proofs are not there and the history is condensed into a few pages. Thus if your mathematical imagination cannot fill in these gaps you will not extract much pleasure from this book. You will rather be frustrated. I myself have read mathematics at the university and still couldn't follow him everywhere. The problem is that the labeling of the book is misleading. This is not a book of popularized mathematics. This is leizure time reading for mathematics professors and math-freaks. If you want to read something that is easy to understand but still interesting try some of the American Mathematical Society's wonderful publications (you can find them all on amazon)."
27889,-1,low budget cheap 90's film of pregnancy,"3 or 4 college buds all court the same row captain and then she becomes pregnant///focuses all around the bar and their goofiness...when word comes out she has a kid, they all rush, not knowing who is the dad and they all step up - but it is pretty playful and not realistic."
27893,-1,"Great story, excellent writing, poorly edited.","Like so many other people who have read Lynn Austin's Gods and Kings, I appreciated her fine writing skills and excellent story telling ability. However, her editors must have struggled with the manuscript translation to ebook style. There were so many lines that did not separate into paragraphs, punctuation problems, words not separated or separated words when not needed, and words run together, that at times it was difficult to read. I can't believe that Bethany House would release a script with this many errors in it. An author of this caliber deserves a better production than this gobblygook."
27907,-1,2 1/2 stars for yet another unecessary sequel,"There was no reason to make another movie in this series, but I guess there were still some action figures to be sold so here it is. In PG-13, no less! Boy, where to start. Well after 5 or 6 years, the evil OCP is still trying to tame Detroit and build a bigger badder cop. Now the Japanese have taken over OCP and have a Robo of their own and they are twin/triplets? For the most part this 3rd feature is just as bad as the 2nd one, but at least we see some of the townsfolk putting up some resistance. I'm also giving a little credit for some then new acting faces that are more recognized today. Although Peter Weller wisely didn't come back in the role of Murphy watch for Rip Torn, CCH Pounder, Mako, Stephen Root, Bradley Whitford and Jill Hennessy."
27908,-1,Robocop 3(1993),"Robocop 3(1993) was the last nail in the coffin for the Robocop film franchise. B movie director Fred Dekker tones down the violence and adds a lot of campy humor into the film so it can get a PG-13 rating. Peter Weller bailed from the series and Robert John Burke was cast as Robocop! Officer Lewis(Nancy Allen) is tragically killed off by an evil OCP officer! Robocop takes sides with people who are being kicked out of their homes by OCP so they can build Delta City over Old Detroit. The film is even more camped up by throwing a robo-ninja into the movie! Basil Poledouris returned to give us a real Robocop music score. Robocop 3 is a mish-mash of serious drama and campy comedy. Robocop ""borrows"" a pimp's car to chase bad guys! Even with the best of intentions, Robocop 3 was still a failure."
27910,-1,This is Painfully SH*T!!!,"After the high quality of the first two films there's only one way to go...downhill and fast.This film put plain and simply is pants! A crappy japanese cyborg is created as the new nemesis for robocop, & it looks exactly like a human.A piss-take of the first two films rolled into one, what a disaster...ignore this film."
27922,-1,Not for experienced users,"I purchased this book with the idea that it might teach me something new, but I was mistaken. If you already have basic Photoshop knowledge, this may not be the book for you. I returned it because my money would be better invested elsewhere. If you have no idea where to begin with digital artwork, then I would recommend taking a look here. This is for the novice, not the intermediate or advanced user."
27928,-1,This was an incredibly boring book.,"William Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation is perhaps the most boring and vexatious book I have ever read. The plain style employed by Bradford is, undoubtably, because of his Puritan backgroud, but that is still no excuse for the tedious and often archaic redition of events. I should think that a high-school text book would give a more lively presentation of life in the ""New Jerusalem"", as Bradford calls it. The antidiluvian vocabulary and monotonous recording of events made this a very difficult book to get through. I would not recommend it to my peers"
27930,-1,Poor design.,"The good news is that this coffee maker doubles as a humidifier. Steam shoots out of mine like a 19th century train locomotive. The lack of a proper seal between the filter basket lid and the water reservoir is the culprit.The filter basket and water reservoir are also not separate chambers. This causes steam to rise from the filter basket, hit the lid, and condense as water back into the reservoir. No doubts this is the main factor contributing to the very long brewing process."
27940,-1,2 Bluesy,"This album is wat too bluesy. I don't understand Eric Clapton's diabloical obsession with the blues. The blues is silly and outdated. So is this album. There are a couple of standout tracks, but most of it is just psychedelic blues. GIBBERISH! That's what most of this is! GIBBERISH! Who cares whether the blues dummy feels free or not? I for one, do not."
27949,-1,missing instruction,"I used this product over the weekend and having problems with my eyes it was hard to read the back label. The company not including that normal one page instruction made it very difficult for me. In that case, I could have purchased similar item at Walmart and it would have been cheaper for me to return it if I was not satisfied. I would have sent this item back. However,shipping cost was too much."
27950,-1,re-wrapped oozing cheese,"Lovely sentiment, not what was expected, though. Somehow thought the cheese would be in a gift box similar to the one shown, not just stuffed into dismal styrofoam. I'm not certain what to make of the leaking eplorateur that was rewrapped in some plastic wrap....hmmm..wonder if it was shipped out that way or someone had opened the container -it's below freezing here, so doubt it ""thawed"" en routewill probably go out for dinner or to the jeweler next year"
27963,-1,something fishy about the prices here,"List price over $500, $300 here. That would sound good--except this exact ladder (Type 1, 22 foot, model 10303) is only $259 at the Little Giant website with free shipping, $249 from Home Depot again with free shipping. So the 'free work platform' is actually costing $40-$50 dollars...which is not exactly a bargain.I did eventually get one of these ladders and as long as you don't mind the weight (too much for my wife) they are amazingly convenient."
27977,-1,Really needs an AC adapter,"See the reviews for the AUA-1422 - a similar item with one extra 1394 port. Adaptec has some crazy requirements for a power supply (12V, 2.1A), and used to offer one that fit them through their store, but apparently no longer do! Without the adapter, this unit is only usable for items that draw almost no power through the USB or 1394 connection - which is a shame, because the Adaptec 1394 implementation was always the most stable on my machines. Look for one that includes an AC adapter or some other way of bringing power to the unit instead."
27978,-1,Shares several track with Everything I Need. I prefer Everything I Need instead,"While this album isn't bad, several of the songs also exist on the Everything I Need album. I own both and in my opinion, the Everything I Need versions of these songs are much better."
27979,-1,Slow Paced and Dragging,Slow paced and dragging this story could have been told in a better way. Even those with mental illness are not so lackluster. I was grateful for fast forward.
27983,-1,Good story but would not recomend it,This movie needed a little more to it. It seemed like it was going to become really interesting throughout the movie but just kind of stays in the same place. Would not recomend it.
27989,-1,Is R Kelly in identity crisis?,"R Kelly actually got me into listening to cool romantic melodious black music. His past albums followed a style typical to only him. However TP-2.com got me wondering whether he is losing touch to his unique style or whether he is just trying to prove he can also do what others are doing. Either way, it is a pity because the album didn't reflect his identity. It is not a CD worth buying even if you are a fanatic fan of R Kelly."
27990,-1,"""I Wish"".....I never bought this album","This is a very disappointing release. I'm sure R. Kelly worked hard on this release, but the lack of content of the songs written on this album is disturbing. The production, while clear, is uninspiring. ""I Wish"" is the only gem on this album.This effort is reminisent of the 1994 album 12 Play. However, 12 Play (94') release is loaded with heavy bass and catchy tunes. TP-2.com is an album for the ""fans"". Unfortunately, fans are willing to accept anything these day. After the 1998 release ""R"", Kelly showed everyone that he is a skilled songwritter and producer. TP-2.com leaves you with one question, what happened between to Kelly?"
27992,-1,HEARD IT ALL BEFORE,YOU KNOW SOMETIME HIS MUSIC ALL SOUNDS THE SAME .DON'T GET ME WRONG HE IS VERY VERY TALENTED BUT THIS CD JUST REALLY DOES NOTHING 4 ME IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMTHING THAT HE HAS DO BEFORE HE JUST REMASTERD IT .TRY AGAIN KELLY BECAUSE YOU DID NOT PULL THE SHEETS OVER MY HEAD WITH THIS ONE.
27998,-1,"Good for the very religious, but not for the rest of us","A TON of the quotes in this book are religious in nature--whether they be bible verses, quotes about ""god in christ,"" about faith, praying, etc, etc! As an Atheist, I didn't appreciate having so many religious quotes in what is billed as just a book of quotes on ""Wisdom."" And they aren't only in one section of the book, but ALL OVER--in the sections about art, nature, love and friendship, conscience, etc! I feel like a ""bait and switch"" was pulled on me, and that this book should be advertised as a religious quote book. So I'd say buy it if you're religious and draw your inspiration from religion, but not if you aren't/don't."
28000,-1,Not Fun!!!!,The Neopets collection is not as good as it seems. You could only play a few games and you cannot do as many things on it compared to the neopets website. this toy is not educational because it doesnt teach you anything and it isnt fun to play with. You play with it only a few days and then you get tired of playing with it that you just leave it hanging around. I dont recommend this toy for anybody.

28022,-1,An Alagna That We Have No Heard,Well let's start with Alagna's darkened voice. I think Roberto may be developing Carreras-Itis. This is cartainly a different sounding Roberto Alagna that I have ever heard. His middle is muddy and his top doesn't ring like in the past. I like the selection of songs including a song he wrote for this album. Not all the arrangements are tradtional (some even being on the ridiculous side) and maybe this makes his efforts a little tainted. In the liner notes Roberto comments on his approach to some of the songs. He admits he tries to sound like a pop singer (i.e. White Christmas-what a butcher job). On other songs he was a tenor. Even that doesn't add up to much. Tenor fans and Alagna fans will be very disappointed with his singing. I was. This album will let him iclude himself as one of the elading tenors in the post Domingo/Pavarotti/ and Carreras era. His Sacred Aria album is much better than this one.
28023,-1,unseen is the word,"I read this book two years ago and had the opportunity to participate in an interview with the author on National Public Radio. Ms. Gibbons was gracious, of course, but she could not answer the obvious difficulties in this book. The chronology is confused, and while the book reaches for important issues, ie the need for a young girl to have a mother, the treatment of the characters is shallow. The longing is there, and it is expressed well, but ultimately, the miraculous ""healing"" of the mother and her immediate death after her restoration--undermine whatever strength was in the novel.The one character that the reader has no trouble believing is Pearl, the caring maternal housekeeper. She is a jewel of characterization, much needed and appreciated in this novel."
28031,-1,Mostly filler,"System of a Down's debut album seemed hopeful. An unique sociopolitical hardcore album with a bit of room for improvement. Unfortunatly the improvement never came. The follow up album, Toxicity, contains a few singles and simple filler tracks. The political lyrics suggested by the band title have been toned down (probably to broaden the audience) as well as the rock. Very disappointing."
28035,-1,[bad deal],Listin to The velvet underground's Murder Mystery and then listen to chop suey. You can not tell me they didn't rip that intro from the velvets.I Dont care about this CD I just felt like saying that they ripped the velvet underground's murder mystery off.
28040,-1,Despicable lyrics,Despicable lyrics promoting drugs and denigrating police destroy otherwise noteworthy and engaging rock music.
28042,-1,Bunch of Garbage,There is only 2 good songs on this cd and you here them on the radio all the time. This is depressing dreadful music I wanted to slash my wrist after listening to it but instead I broke it and toss it in the trash can were it belongs.
28043,-1,Weak,"System of a Down's unusual interpretation of modern metal has one them credit amongst metalheads searching for something different. I, myself, would love to find something out there that's totally different (I.e, another Tool vs Korn), but this just isn't it. System of a Down's weak sophomore release just doesn't do it. It lacks any sign of maturity music-wise. Lyrical content has grown a little, as eveident on Forest and Deer Dance. But this lacks anything that would musically satisfy someone with an ear for real metal..."

28068,-1,mmmmmmmmm?????????,"I did learn things I didn't know about 1969 Woodstock. But this DVD uses too much video from the oringial movie. There's hours and hours of film that was shot sitting in some Hollywood vault somewhere that could be used. If you enjoyed the original movie you don't really need to buy this one. To much of the same thing over again, althrough the short interviews where a nice touch."
28071,-1,One of My Least Favorite DM CDs,"Right from the beginning, with track #1 (""New Life""), I pretty much knew what to expect from the rest of this CD: fluffy, upbeat synth/pop that made me feel like I was ODing on ""sweetness"". Comparing this CD to Depeche Mode's newer, more somber music, I was amazed at how different they sound now compared to twenty or so years ago--and thank god for the change, too. I know I wouldn't be a DM fan if all of their songs had remained like this.The only two decent tracks on ""Speak and Spell"" (or, at least, the two that I didn't outright hate) are #2 (""Puppets""), a medium-tempoed song with a catchy chorus, and #11 (""Just Can't Get Enough""), a high-energy, spunky track. The rest are just too cheesy and silly for me, in particular the two ""pretty boy"" songs: #4 (""Boys Say Go!"") and #6 (""What's Your Name?""). I've honestly heard catchier tunes on my old Nintendo system, i.e., Dr. Mario. Depeche Mode fan or not, you can skip this CD and not feel guilty about it."
28072,-1,buy the import !!!!,"If you must have Speak and Spell ( which is quite good, despite being very lightweight, fluffy, lyrically empty early-eighties synth-pop ) do yourself a favour and spend the extra money on the import version. The US version pales in comparison to the original Uk version. There is a great song ( Sometimes I Wish I Was Dead, which is not as depressing as its title would suggest ) that was left off the US pressing, and the extra time was taken up by the inclusion of the 12"" remix of Just Can't Get Enough (which is better in its original 7"" mix anyway - over six minutes of Just Can't Get Enough is, well, too much of enough ). There are also a few great b-sides that are on the UK version of the cd."
28087,-1,Not Much Worthwhile Here,"Constantine was a big disappointment to me. Unlike many other reviewers, I had never seen this in print. Reeves does a fair job in his role, but Rachel Weisz fails to deliver here. Her character is unconvincing and ""wooden"". The story is a remix of story lines from other stories, and it fails to bring much that is fresh to the screen. The theology is strange, Satan looks like a retired guy from Florida, and the ""balance between good and evil"" rule seems contrived.The story was not compelling. I almost turned it off out of boredom."
28090,-1,"LIKED THE MOVIE,BUT IS NOT DTS SOUND!!!","I cant believe these movies on double disk put all the loaded stuffs on disk ,And hard work, which most people don't care, then they put 5.1 audio sound crap to it, such as awful...please people if u do all the goodies an all on DVDS at least put the DTS sound to it for most people like me have surround sound these days at home..Such movies like this kind of gender u should have a blast high-end sound to it to really enjoy the movie such as DTS ...for this important matter I give 2 starts and I am not going to buy this DVD."
28092,-1,What was this story about?,"Yes there were some good effects and wild looking creatures, some decent ideas, a handful of good acting, but where the hell was the story? How many times can you kill yourself and go to hell to see the same thing over and over. It was less irritating when the same thing was done in little nicky. Reeve's acting is normally garbage but he gets put in some good movies like the replacements. This time it was his bad acting paired with an awful movie. You need a good ending."
28108,-1,Boring,I muddled through the old world language of his early adult years and enjoyed reading about how different colonial America was and how people just freely moved wherever life took them but then we hit the big gap where he didn't write and after that all he covered was his philosophy of life. I quit reading half way through the book.
28113,-1,slow,interesting and well worth a read but difficult with the old English at times and tends to be long winded and rambles somewhat
28116,-1,Didacticism at its finest,"Benji Franklin is a fascinating guy. He really is. Unfortunately, you really don't get to know him through his autobiography (it was written for the moral instruction of his son, first of all).Half the book reads like a ""Mrs. Manners"" column and the other half reads like a resume. Franklin lists all his numerous contributions to American society fairly coldly and not a little pretentiously (but we can allow him the pretention) and fills in the blank spaces with moral and philosphical instruction. ]While he was a great inventor and statesman and had a knack for collecting and spitting out trite ""truisms,"" Benny just isn't that interesting a moral philospher. If you're really interested in getting to know Ben Franklin, check out a scholar's biography--if anything, you get to learn all the juicy stuff about his disgustingly promiscuous sex life."
28127,-1,Not the best of Michener's works,"Michener's books are always interesting quality historical novels. This was is goodhistory but not easy reading. To anyone who was not in the military, his characters mayseem unreal, but believe me, they aren't!!"

28131,-1,Didn't Seem to Help My Dog,"My rescue dog had pretty bad separation anxiety. I wanted to try this to see if it would ease some of the symptoms associated with separation anxiety. I didn't see any difference. I tried two of these, thinking that it might take a little longer, but it never really help my dog.It still might be worth a try for your dog. I can say that it certainly didn't hurt!If your dog is suffering, I still think it's worth a try."
28154,-1,Not a book for beginners,"I bought this book for my first PHP college class. I had only dabbled in PHP, so I was in no way ready for this book. While the book is very large, it fails to go indepth for explanations. I tend to learn well by a book staying with a program and going through into detail what to do and then expanding on that program throughout. This book is only useful for referencing."
28162,-1,BALLS EVERYWHERE!,We live in AK and so we thought we needed to find something to keep our toddler active while being cooped up during the winter. Our son loves it...WE HATE IT! It takes up almost the whole living room...that's not the bad part! There is only a bottom in the Large section. The two medium section are open on the bottom so there are always balls everywhere! We bought extra balls (which you need) but our house turns into a ball pit! But we make it a game with our toddler to pick up the balls...but WARNING you will be finding balls for days!
28168,-1,not too sturdy,This product was made a lot cheaper than a similar tunnel we bought years ago - the material is thinner and the construction & seams a lot less sturdy.

28173,-1,meh,"If I wanted a map of Texas I would have purchased an atlas instead of this boring book. The author had a good idea, but despite that, the only reason I even finished the book was because I had 100 pages to go and I was too damn OCD to just leave it at that."
28179,-1,A Cheap Introduction?,"While this book is not the most expensive on the market, it appears to have been created from a 'boiler-plate' of a series of canine books. Rather too much of it is not specific to Great Pyrenees. We have owned several Great Pyrenees and, from time to time, need information from reference sources. This book does not fall in to that category. It can be classified as ""Read through it once and then never refer to it again"".There are several other Great Pyrenees books on the market that more adequately describe the requirements of owning one of these large dogs. Andrew Jonson's attempt to address all matters relating to Great Pyrenees falls well short of the mark.This is not a book to recommend to potential or existing owners. Probably okay for children"
28181,-1,Not like the ones I've seen--not as good,"Instead of being a better product, this one is made cheaper and seems flimsy and doesn't respond like the ""older"" versions. Aren't things supposed to get better? This one is made in China--where all the leaded paint and computer things are being messed with/sabatoged?Wish I'd gone into a store and looked at it, held it (this one is lighter & not good quality) and the color is dark (not the bright red or blue I've always used/seen) and hard to read the text, too.Would have sent it back, but for the shipping costs (which ran up the price)."
28184,-1,20-Questions Handheld Game - Big Disappointment,"This game, although somewhat fun, is very limited in its capacity. The only way that the game is able to guess the item about which you are thinking, is if you choose something (an object, etc.) that is very simple, and that you can describe with great accuracy. Otherwise, the game guesses your thoughts incorrectly most of the time. It is not very sophisticated, and is truly not worth the money. In other words, do not buy this product."
28188,-1,Satire? That Quickly Grows Tiresome,"Sort of an odd stew satirizing porn novels and English political extremists featuring an antihero skinhead as the catalyst for many things. Loads of over-the-top sex, violence and ideological debate make for a somewhat tiresome book. Not likely to appeal to many people."

28195,-1,Missing tape,"I was planning to use this audio for a reading class. It is a pretty big set of DVD's and DVD #1 is missing. I contacted the dealer and got no resolution. I just wanted the first DVD, or a new set, but it was his only one. It was sealed so it had to be originally packaged with that DVD missing."
28198,-1,A Classic?,I honestly don't know how this novel has become a classic. As an avid reader I had to practically force myself to get through this book and only did so because my book club was reading it. I wasn't the only person in our club who was disappointed. It was a miserable story and pointless. It was a great discription of life in Brooklyn during that time period but Betty Smith never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them. This novel needs more character development to be a classic. I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it really is a great description of life in Brooklyn.
28200,-1,So So....,"I read this book for our book club. The reviews for this book got my hopes high before I started reading it, but disappointed me after I completed the book. Betty Smith wrote this book based on her own life experience, but she did not add any value for the readers who read the book (in my opinion). If you have no interest in experiencing poor childhood or awkward adultlecense, I would not recommend the book."
28207,-1,Hope you have better luck,I am a stay at home mother and I was really excited to see this product when it came out. I thought that this would have something for both my boys. To my surprise neither one of them was to thrilled with this climber/swing set. The swings are used rarely and I've hardly seen them use the climber. The whole thing is very sun faded after only a year and the platforms for the slides are kinda flimsy. Honestly I expected more from Little Tikes. We have some great toys from that company but this one didn't work out for our family.
28208,-1,The Principle of Relativity,"I'm not happy with this book at all. I'm not a scientist outside of the field of information technology and I want something to explain Einstein's theories that I could read. I read such a book when I was young. It's out of print, but you can purchase it on Amazon used. It's entitled ""Relativity: The Special and the General Theory--A Clear Explanation that Anyone Can Understand"" by Albert Einstein.That did it for me, this book put me to sleep."
28212,-1,Value for money - fair,"I have this in all 3 colors, and only the blue color looks fine. The other two colors, I don't think I would like to wear to office where I am a mid-manager level. Reason being that the fabric is a blend hence thinner than the normal 100% cotton shirts that I prefer. Looking at the retail price of the shirt, I was expecting something better."
28218,-1,not as great as,"not as great as i thought. brought it because it was costing me $10 per tube. have been applying it for about 3 weeks now and saw little difference. you have to keep reapplying the gel to get some type of a result. i had used other products just once for about 6 months and they had worked much better - buy the more expensive stuff (maxforce or advion), dont go for their price!"
28220,-1,Eh Is All I Can Really Muster,"When i first read the plot for this book, it sounded good. Maybe not original in the Zombie genre (i'v only found Sandman Slim Kill The Dead original in the genre). But god i did not expect it to kill me with boredom. I am a avid reader but i had to push myself to finish this book, it was slower than the undead it chronicled. Also i didn't care by the end of the book which of the main charters died...i was actually hoping for it . The mere thought of trying to read the others in the series... frightens me. Unless David Moody's style of writing changes and actually gets some life to it...i wont be reading further novels from him."
28222,-1,Not the best in zombies,"I was very excited about reading this book, especially knowing it was a series. The hope to carry characters through a cataclysm is one that intreges me. Unfortunatly, although the concept around the story is a good one, the characters are incredibly unsympathetic. They are either bickering or whining, even close moments when you feel that they are going to connect it turns into a confronation. At the end I really didn't care if they lived or died.And the language is unbelievably harsh, yes, I don't mind the occasional f-bomb, but at times it seemed unrelenting. If you agree with this review and have read the other books and Mr Moody's writing style has changed please let me know."
28223,-1,Autumn,"I really tried to like this book. I probably made it halfway.The book dragged and was quite boring. In an attempt to make the zombies ""different"", I thought the author failed miserably. I kept waiting for something to happen and... nothing. One reviewer said the last 75 pgs were great. Huh?I couldn't keep the characters straight, I ended up taking notes. That being said.... the characters were hateful. Nothing redeeming whatsoever. E very page (just about) kept asking.... are you okay?It was odd how close they got to the zombies.... even bringing one into their refuge without knowing if they were contagious.Lastly, it always amazes me that during TEOTAWKI nobody really cares about their lost ones (except one guy). If my family were across the ocean, you bet your butt I'd be looking for a row boat.I have no intent to read a sequel.... I really don't care what happens to these morons."
28230,-1,"Love the idea, but not the result","I loved the idea of having all my shoes on a tree that I could spin around, but the end result was messy. It was weird having the soles of my shoes facing outwards. Wherever I put the tree seemed like a dirty place. I replaced the tree with drop-front clear plastic shoe boxes that I love."
28238,-1,Apollo Astronaut,"Trying to teach my students about space travel, and the purposes of wearing a space suit...this was much too small to use in a classroom. The details are nice but no one can see it. Overpriced and not worth it."
28249,-1,You want gruesome?,"Multiple baby mutilations ruined this book for me. If you're a fan of forensics and don't mind the innocent being victim of psychos, go for it. I was intrigued by the plot, yes, and how she could get it to all hang together, but there were too many cliches: the witness whose call is missed then disappears, etc. Too much, too gory, too unrealistic."
28250,-1,"Dull, flat writing kills the fun","Gore yes, lots of information about autopsies and assorted other matters, rather too-clearly-fictitious characters ... It all adds up to a rather flat, dispiriting formula effort. If you just HAVE to know who's responsible every time you read of a fictitious killing, then you'll get through this, otherwise it becomes rather a drag."
28251,-1,Abridged,"The info on this audio book, Death du Jour (received from bordeebook), didn't indicate that it is abridged. I didn't like it much, partly due to her poor use of similes, partly because I got tired of the plot development. I didn't listen to the last 45 minutes."
28255,-1,Poor Absorbency,"V disappointed with these. Way too big to be a size 1, poor fit and poor absorbency. Just finished my pack of Huggies and the difference is clear. Stick to Huggies..."
28263,-1,Should of stopped after the first three,"The first three books held my interest the whole way through. Intelligent writing and an exciting story. Foundations Edge was okay. Foundation and Earth, however, was preposterous. I'm afraid to say a LONG, boring story with a rediculous ending. He didn't really want to write these two books and it shows."
28266,-1,Tried for second time to enjoy this book - still bad,"I read this book several years ago, but didn't write a review. I decided to renew my interest in the Foundation series and since this book was hazy in my memory, I decided to reread it. Now I remember why it's hazy. This has to be the most boring and wordy book Asimov has ever written, period. I found myself skipping over large sections of nonsense dialogue of Bliss arguing with Trevise about Gaia. Nobody talks and discusses as much without saying anything as the characters in this book! I managed to get on by skimming and concentrating on plot points. Asimov in his foreword said his publisher asked him to write a large book and he complied by filing it with 80% useless chatter and boring dialogue. He could have written a good short story about this quest for Earth that would have been enjoyable, rather that this bloated, boring, and frankly turgid effort. I gave it two stars in respect to Asimov, had it been any other author, one or no stars."
28267,-1,eh,I became enthralled by Issac Asimov through a collection of his short stories. In just a few pages he presented and explored a brain-boggling idea. But in this longer work and two others in the Foundation series (Foundation and Empire and Prelude to Foundation) I admit considerable disappointment. There are some good ideas but they're lost in a sea of shallow characters and needless ramblings. I won't give up on the author because when he hits he really hits. But I'm through with the Foundation series
28272,-1,Bewildering Mish-mash,"Eric Flint calls this an ""oddball volume"" and a ""cross between a traditional anthology and a novel"" in the preface. I found it a bewildering mishmash, even the wrap up section at the end. The storyline jumps between characters and locations frequently, and the timeline jumps back and forth as well. The number of characters in play is astounding, and most of them are not the main 1632 characters. It was just plain hard to follow, and therefore hard to fully enjoy. For newbies, this is a definite DO NOT BUY. If you are a 1632 series experienced reader, go ahead, but be forewarned that this one falls a little short."
28279,-1,"Very pretty, not durable","I rrceived my ring very quickly in the mail. Because it was on sale, I felt I'd gotten a great deal! Especially once I put it on my finger. Its a beautiful ring! But in less than a week, one of the stones is already gone. What a disappointment."
28287,-1,disappointed! little treatment,"I have to say this one has little treatment for my Tinea Versicolor on stomach. I have used two bottles for 6 months, but it just very slightly goes better. I also used other tree oils, but still no effect. maybe it's because mine is a little bit severe since it's already there for like 4 yeas before I decided to treat it. But it's no excuse. it's should be used to treat this kind of gray skin. I'm disappointed."
28288,-1,Letdown,"When i first heard of the possibility of a star blazers dvd i was quite excited.Unfortunately once i received it,i was throughly disappointed.Even though the original program was quite old,voyager could have done a much better job here.They cut corners to save money.Even some of the poorest vcd's have better video and sound quality than this dvd edition.You would do yourself much better to buy the current video tapes that are out there.As long as you have a halfway decent vcr,you'll do much better than this dvd edition.Keep your eye out for the japanese edition dvd's.I'm sure they are coming,if they aren't out already.They won't cut corners at the expense of quality.Save your money and spend it on some other anime dvd's like sol bianca.(Don't waste your money on the funimation dragonball z dvds,or the evangelion dvd's either.Their quality is almost bad as this)"
28292,-1,I think it was edited,"Before I purchased this, I saw cutouts for Heidi Marks role. Many of the scene I saw were not in this version on DVD. I do not know if the film was edited or the cutouts were literally the stuff let out of the final version of the episode. At any rate I did not find Heidi's episode very erotic. It looked like it had been hacked to pieces."
28297,-1,Moll Fllanders,I had purchase this book before but not from Amazon. This edition is not what I had expected. I was looking for a student edition. Also this book had been wrtitten inside the pages
28300,-1,enlightened ??,"This is one of the most depressing books I hope to ever read. The best summation I can give is, oh so there were just as many dishonest, stealing thieves in times past as there are today.It would be a good study for criminal minds and how to make light of ripping people off. I hated the book and am disappointed that it even falls into the classification of 'The Classics'"
28302,-1,Not the worst,As far as school books go it could have been much worse.it dragged and there were too many monitorial references.
28306,-1,A little on the fluffy side,"Although ""Hyperspace"" is fairly easy to read, and does have some interesting ideas in it, it's a little light on the science compared to other books I've read. That might be due to the fact that the subject matter is still in the theoretical stage. But, still, much of the book is anecdotal and many of the analogies used to explain the main theories are repetitive and off-subject. Plus, the book (and the information inside) is pretty out of date. Kaku often refers to things that might happen by the year 2000. This book is more useful for light reading than for really learning about unification theories and multi-dimensional universe models."
28311,-1,no story,"This was just a travel log...almost just a daily journal. I expected a story line; a plot. It became more and more of the same, and less and less interesting. When it ended, I was shocked, and my response was, ""that's it?"""
28316,-1,"It Works, However....","Installed this and two new drives and was quite happy with the new disk space available. However after a while I noticed that my system speed had been reduced considerably. After troubleshooting and removing the card from my system, everything was back up to speed. It works but at a price."
28322,-1,Misleading title,"The title of this CD is misleading because what is supposed to be kulintang music, entitled Ka-singkil, Vinta, Tahing-Baila, Malong - dance accompaniment for Southern Mindanao dances are not the authentic kulintang music as played by the indigenous peoples of this region. Likewise with Dinuya - dance of the Mountain Province indigenous people. These pieces in this recording are percussion instrumentation as performed by the Bayanihan Dance Company quite different from the traditional percussion (kulintang and gangsa) music of the indigenous tribes."
28329,-1,Heidi,"Heidi is a wonderful story. Although I love Shirley Temple movies, I was disappointed that this movie did not follow the story line of the book but added unnecessary plot line. I would not let my younger grandchildren watch this adaptation of Heidi. The cover may be color but the movie is B & W"
28332,-1,"Dude, What Did I Just Watch?","This movie is definitely not one of my favorites. The story, about two ""lovable"" doofuses who lose their car, get involved in a weird science fiction plot, meet up with a group of ""hot chicks"" who may be aliens and end up in a ostrich santcuary run by Brent (This is just a paycheck role for me) Spiner. I thought the Bill and Ted movie were dumb, but Dude, Where's My Car makes them look Shakespearan. The laughs were in the toilet humor vein only and the dialogue, if you could call it that, was obviously written by a middle schooler-guys saying or shouting ""Dude"" every minute is not humorous. Seann needs to change lanes with his role choices and quit playing the sex-on-the-mind idiots like in American Pie 1 and 2. Seeing Spiner in this bomb, after his brillant work as Data in Star Trek:The Next Generation, made me wince. Thank God he appears unbilled..."
28335,-1,Two Stars for a Couple of Yards,"There's nothing wrong with this movie. Accept the fact that it's not a very good film.I give it two stars. There's a scene in the beginning when both boys get knocked over by old people driving cars. Old people. Driving. They can't see very well, so they knocked the kids over. There's about 1 minute of the film spent on this scene.Making fun of old people is so funny. I'm a sarcastic reviewer."
28336,-1,DUDE! SWEET! DUDE ! SWEET! STUPID!,"I don't think this movie was terrible, but it certainly isn't a comedy classics or even one of the best comedies to come out of the year 2000 or 2001(whenever it came out, which i'm sure most people don't really care about). It's just brain candy. One of them gets DUDE and the other gets SWEET tattooed on their backs, this has to be one of the most ridiculously dumb scenes in movie history. There are much better comedy selections out there for you somewhat intelligent folk. I can't be held responsible for the rental fee of this film, that was my husband's job . This is more of a ""dude"" movie, I guess. Unless you are just suddenly in the mood for mindless dumb comedy with alot of T&A, then this will be right up your alley. It also has that cute guy, Ashton Kutcher from That 70s show as Jesse. Chester played by Seann William Scott is best known for his role in ""Road Trip"".(another mindless comedy)."
28343,-1,"Dude, Where's the Exit?!!","DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR aims at the protozoa that swim around in a puddle of sewer water...and succeeds. However, there is one hilarious scene worth watching! This is when our heroes, Jessie and Chester(Ashton Kutcher,Seann William Scott respectively) are in a chinese takeout drive-through... ""and then?""!! Well, you gotta see it because it's that funny. Otherwise, the plot(two Bill and Ted clones who wake up not having a clue of what they had done the night before, find their car missing, and then find themselves thwarting aliens who are trying to destroy the earth) is ridiculous and the main characters get annoying after awhile. Besides the chinese take-out drive-through scene, there are a lot of good lookin' babes to look at, but not much else."
28352,-1,Not at all.,"Joyce is an experimenter, not an essayist.This book is ugly and boring.If you want to read good essays onliterature, art, philosophy or whatever,read Chesterton, Santayana, or Russell.Not a book to smile at."
28356,-1,"Lots of fun, but unreliable","It's fun--great to play with on hardwood or tile floor. I don't think it works on low pile carpet as it claims, but it provides good indoor fun and exercise with minimal danger to people, walls and furniture. UPDATE--I liked it so much that I bought one for my nieces and nephews, but theirs never worked. I don't think they ever bothered to attempt to return it."
28359,-1,Has been,"This was such a great album when it came out, but maybe I just got sick of hearing the songs played over and over again in commercials. It's just not happening any more."
28373,-1,My grandma like it...,"I bought a 12 inch version of Go, years ago. I bought this last week. What a bore! But my grandma like it, she said it was 'pretty' so I guess I'll give it 2 stars for my grandma."
28377,-1,Lots of superficial information which should include more.,"Lots of names in this book, most I have no clue who they are. Tony Williams? Rolf Bjorling? Stephen Burks? I think another column explaining who these people are would wrap this book up nicely. Also, too many empty or generic causes of death. A little research would fill in these blanks (death cirtificates are public information)."
28379,-1,DOA,"Well I bought this PSU long time ago but I forget to write a reviewThis PSU came DOA at the same time that mobo, both I purchased here on AmazonThe PSU never turn on, so I cant' talk so much about it OCZ has good quality on PSU's but sometimes the quality it's just relativeBut thanks to the Customer Supoort of Amazon they help me, so thanks so much to Amazon Support 1000/10"
28382,-1,could be better,"This game is alright. The turning is practically impossible using a controller. I suggest getting the steering wheel hook up thing. The boards are cool and the cars are better, but the gameplay is pretty difficult."
28383,-1,Kinda dated,This DVD set is geared towards older high school students or college students wanting a review. It moves quickly through a lot of excellent information. It would be good for an individual review where frequent pausing is possible. It is also dated. It doesn't mention the Bush/Gore election in its examples of a candidate winning the popular vote but not the electoral college vote. It also uses Geralidine Ferraro as its only example of a woman running for an executive office. And there's no mention of any minority candidates.
28390,-1,Not a good phone,"This phone didn't meet our expectations. We used it in the kitchen for a long time, and found that it is very hard to get clean, even with normal cleaning fluids.Battery life is an issue for this phone. Two new batteries lasted 9 months before they wouldn't hold a charge.When power goes out, there is no electronic memory for time, so when we have a power outage, which is frequent, we have to reset the clock. The outgoing message doesn't erase, so why not the clock???There is no speakerphone capability either."
28405,-1,Why do people think this is a funny movie?,"I do not for the life of me understand all the hype surrounding this movie. Why does everyone love ""Office Space"" so much? There were a few times when I chuckled here and there, but overall this movie just is NOT funny. I do not recommend it."
28409,-1,Sexy but cheap,"I bought the right size, and it fits well and looks great, but it tore and fell apart within 24 hours. It is also NOT crotchless."
28412,-1,Not especially engaging!,"Altho I love the looks of this toy (bright colors) it isn't very engaging. For one, it takes too long to wind the toy to where the clown pops up. I think it's a cute addition to my grandson's toy box, but as far as entertaining him...it doesn't."
28416,-1,These Are NOT 100 Percent COTTON!!!,I ordered what I thought were 100 percent cotton handkerchiefs. These are NOT--and I'm returning them to the manufacturer!
28418,-1,"Okay, but not worth the money","This game is bad. If you liked James Bond, like I do you might like this game. I disliked it because of the slow targeting and poor weapons. Some positives are the red dot scope, but don't be confused. James Bond's auto aim helps immensely this game requires many different buttons to be pushed. When you are shot you are incapacitated for about 1 and 1/2 seconds. Which is an eternity with how fast the computer fires. It takes forever to find your friends and when you do, they usually die. All in all this game is ok, but the storyline is bad."
28421,-1,"""Dont [spend] your Money""","I fell into the huge mistake of looking at the cover of""Roadsers""and thinking it might be cool!WRONG!When I finally recieved this game for the PS1,I put it in my playstation,and was let down right away!!!!The visuals ""[stink]"",and are horrible to watch!The game play is about as fun as watching flys on the wall!I for sure regret this purchase!What ever you do,dont fall in the same mistake I made,purchase""NFS High Stakes"",or""Test Drive Le Mans""if you want a good racing title!"
28426,-1,Too thick,"I was looking for an everyday body oil but this is too thick for everyday use, but o.k. for massages."
28428,-1,Another disapointment,"All MC5 fans are hoping that a concert as clean as ""Jams"" will someday surface. (W're also hoping that Electra will release the complete ""Jams"" sessions!) But this CD is just another collection of non-soundboard live recordings. Not too listenible and even less entertaining. So far the only postumous MC5 CDs worth picking up are ""Babes In Arms"", ""Thunder Express"" and ""Big Bang"".(MC5 fans should sniff out Rob Tyner's incredible solo swan song ""Bloodbrothers""!)"
28436,-1,Looking at the script from a director's point of view,"I bought this script because it is on my community theatre's schedule to perform in March. I was very surprised with how I little I liked the script in its entirety. I am familiar with Sure Thing because I worked on it in college, and was expecting more of the same...quick witted, funny pieces that would easily make for a night of entertainment. Honestly, due to content and language, I don't see how we can perform many of these plays on our stage. I know that the scholars are going to bash me, but from a director's point of view, I vote to shelf this one. No audience is going to want to sit through all 14 of these plays when most won't make much sense to them. They want to be entertained and walk away with a thought other than confusion at the end of the night. This script is perfect for college theatre, but that doesn't make me like it any more."
28437,-1,Well I seem to be alone,"As an actor involved in the production of several of the plays from all in the timing, while I've found that the plays certainly are all memorable, and very clearly written by an INCREDIBLY intelligent person, far too often these plays suffer from being flat out unfunny. No, theyre not unfunny. The jokes just, far too often, come, and simply refrain from BEing funny. It's unfortunate. The Universal Language is a play that is always FUN to do, and one that will never leave peoples brains, but it's not entertaining because of any wit. This is what tends to happen to Ives. He gets going, and write a great play, but the characters don't have much depth, are not particularly interesting to play, and don't manage to actually be comical too frequently, so it's really not worth it to want to participate in the plays. (With the GRAND exception of The Death of Trotsky)"
28446,-1,Damage understated,I thought that the use was well understated. I received the book and the jacket was practically falling to pieces.
28450,-1,could have had more surfing,"When i saw the cover i was very exited to see big wave surfing, I was very unhappy with this movie as all the shot of the surfing scene are taken from a helicopter. Its a nice introduction to big wave surfing but nothing compare to riding giants or the billabong odisey. The rock climbing was also so so. The snow board scenes are nice as always but nothing special.Overall this blu ray is good but doesnt show you anything new or that you event seen before."
28454,-1,Film Noir Reader,"I give this book two stars instead of one because it fills a gap in my film noir book collection, but I have to say it has dated badly. I bought because I loved Alain Silver's book Noir Style, which is a collection of black-and-white stills from film noir classics, with marvelous commentary. But the Film Noir Reader opens with a collection of essays from the 1970s that display everything bad about the 70s, academic, pretentious, pompous, over-anxious to establish a high-brow status for a low-brow art form (at least it was then). In the 2nd and 3rd sections, the ""up-to-date"" essays, we get, for instance, an analysis of the TV show Miami Vice in terms of its film noir elements... Miami Vice???"
28460,-1,Too sketchy,"I was eager to read the book after watching the film on BBC2 (England). I expected the novel to be more descriptive, imaginative and more three dimensional than the film but found it to be quite sketchy and without fluidity. It jumped from past to present and from scene to scene quite disjointedly and I found it difficult to continue reading for I felt like I'd read the same paragraph over and over. As a result of this the only characters which seemed to convey themselves as three dimensional were that of Rick and Sheryls'. There didn't seem to be any revelation at the end of the story, I guess with having knowledge of that era that it would be quite obvious in the way things ended, with broken teenage love and little thought for the result of that. Quite disappointing overall, though worth watching the film."
28462,-1,It was Great... for five minutes.,"I'm giving this two stars because the problem may be a one-off. My son received this as a Christmas gift yesterday. I unpackaged it this morning and wound it up and it worked great. My kid loved it, the melody was nice and all was grand. Until I tried to wind it up again. I heard a loud snapping sound and the winding wheel started spinning free. I opened up the case to see if the problem is repairable, but it's not. The gear that attaches the winding wheel to the music box is made from a cheap, flimsy plastic, and all the teeth had snapped off. I have an email in to the toy company to see if they can help me get a replacement part, and if they do I will update my rating to make it more favorable."
28467,-1,Mere Christianity,Book was supposed to be gently used. Came in with pieces tornof the front and back covers.
28469,-1,Well written; poorly thought out.,This book is a fine example of how beautiful prose can mask otherwise muddled thinking. Those who are desperate for some validation of their religious beliefs will undoubtedly praise this diminutive tome. Those with sharper wit will easily see past the eloquent facade and discover why this emporer has no clothes.
28470,-1,Book,"The book took a while to get here, and when it did, it was in rough shape for supposedly being brand new. I also discovered I could have bought it for $5 cheaper from another online retailer. Not too impressed with this purchase."
28475,-1,Is this it?,"I had high expectations for this book, but it seems that C.S. Lewis is just saying the same things over and over again to justify his own transformation from an atheist into a Christian. Interesting historically, as a Christian response to WWII, but not very useful in a modern quest for Answers."
28485,-1,"Please quit leaving out pages, Nabu Press","Bancroft and Zumpt did a great job with the content. Nabu Press's print job is blurry, but the free Google ebook also has blurry printing. Maybe no clearly-printed exemplars exist. Nabu Press says on an end-paper: ""This book may have occasional imperfections such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc. that were either part of the original artifact, or were introduced by the scanning process."" Nabu did indeed leave pages 136 and 137 out of this book. I got this book on a sale for something like 7 or 8 dollars. I am not going to pay full price for Nabu Press books until they give up their right to omit pages. The paper and ink are fine. If Nabu has worked from a clearly-printed exemplar, the book would probably be an excellent print-on-demand. Until Nabu Press quits excusing itself for bad workmanship on its books, I will only be tempted to buy their books when they are at a 2/3 discount."
28486,-1,Getting Worse,"I should have known better, these movies are not getting any better, just the opposite. I hope this is the last one."
28491,-1,waste of money for lg dogs,did not work for my dogs. waste of money. easy to return.still looking for one that is simple and works. i have mastiffs and found it flimsey.maybe it works for small dogs
28507,-1,I should have dodged this one.,"Sorry but this movie stunk. Maybe one or two laughs at most. That turd movie ""Envy"" was funnier than this garbage."
28510,-1,"Comedies suck, some might be funny, but...","one thing that is gauronteed with any comedy is that they are poorly made, poorly scripted, poorly acted, stupid wastes of money. This movie is funny, so i guess you can say it does what is supposed to (make you laugh), but there is more to entertainment then stupid sex jokes, and the pain of others (funny but can carry a movie only so far), how about changing things up and making a comedy with a good script, good performances, different forms of humor(not just people getting hit in the face with a ball, it was funny but only after the first few times). 3 out of a 10, it made me laugh, but could have done more."
28535,-1,inexpensive but not properly shielded,"This HDMI cable occasionally crackles. If the connection is jostled, the noise goes away but it works itself loose again. Our other cable didn't have this problem with the same DVD player and so I'm blaming it on the cable."
28545,-1,A children's movie which could have been edited to 45 min.,"My family found this movie to be long and tedious. Even my three year old daughter does not want to see it again. Overall, the dialog is monotone and the songs are more of the plot than the characters. Unfortunately these songs are all done in the same whiny tone."
28549,-1,"Great Movie, Poor Quality Release","I remember seeing this movie at the Drive-In when I was a child. I used to have it on VHS until it was destroyed. I couldn't wait till it came out on DVD. However, once I got my copy I became rather disappointed with the quality. The colors look faded, It's Full-Screen only, It even seems to be slightly crooked and there are distortions at the very top of the screen..... What a horrible way to release such a classic."
28550,-1,Horrible quality. Believe it.,"Well, unlike the people that read the reviews about ""horrible quality"" and bought it anyways, I'm here because of the horrible quality lol. I got this DVD in through netflix and it did indeed look awful. However, the DVD was quite scratched so I thought maybe... just maybe... because it was such consistent scratching over the whole DVD, it was just that and I'd get a newer copy. So, here I am after a google search for ""last unicorn"" AND ""poor quality"" AND DVD. So, apparantly it just does suck that bad lol. Oh well.Anyways, believe it. I thought I was watching a worn out VHS copy of the film. Poor indeed. A crying shame :("
28553,-1,the songs are excruciating,"this is a really annoying movie. my kids will be watching it in the next room and my husband and i will be in agony, having to hear the corny songs and contrived dialogue coming in through the open door. now, if my kids were rating this they would probably give it 5 stars, they love it. go figure."
28575,-1,I tried,"For someone who is reading the whole series at one time, this book might be great. But when I read this book, it had been over two years since I'd read the one before it, and I could not even finish it. I tried to stick with it, but I eventually put it down and could not pick it up again. Is this not the conclusion to the MITFORD series? So why can't a poor reader read about MITFORD instead about a bunch of characters we know nothing about, who we won't get to know very well seeing as this is the last book. I am a big fan of the whole series, but this book was simply painful."
28582,-1,didn't care for it,"well, I have two of these and they end up waking me up at night for discomfort. maybe its the stress on the toe be forced to a different position, but I can't sacrifice sleep at this expense. it is not designed to walk in."
28583,-1,not recommend for narrow foot,This product doesn't really suit my narrow foot and keep slipping down. Otherwise I think it might work pretty well.
28584,-1,Not comfortable. Look for another splint,"PediFix Nighttime Bunion Regulator, Left, MediumI have what one would consider a 'moderate' type bunion. My toe is not out of alignment that much and the 'bump' is noticeable (5 on a scale of 1-10). I bought this product b/c the pain has increased to the point it will sometimes hurt to walk. (I'm already wearing shoes with a wide toebox and have for 20+ years). This splint seemed to work well the first couple nights but shortly thereafter it wouldn't stay on comfortably. The plastic separator began to uncomfortably dig into the area between my toes.If the point is to leave it on overnight to get good results, the item needs to be comfortable. This was not and I have since thrown it away."
28585,-1,Please enter a title for your review,"This is supposed to be a swing/metal crossover band, but it's really just some rudimentary amateurish Black Sabbath style metal with a singer who makes a really weak attempt at a swing croon. There is no genuine elements of swing in this music, it's just a bunch of talentless metal guys attempting something they have no real grasp of. There isn't even really any genuine elements of metal either, it's basically just stoner/hard rock."
28586,-1,The shadows between,"The poltergiest: The Legacy book The Shadows Between left me in the dark. Even through the story was interesting to read I had to real follow the plot carefully. The story start with the appearance of a man, David Carson arriving at The Legacy House. Who he is and where he came from is discovered as the story moves on in the book. I am a fan of the series and the books except for this one. It was slow going and for one to understand what is happenning in the story you have to read very carefully or read it a second time. I did enjoy reading the other books in the series but ""The Shadows Between"" left me confused about what was going on. Sorry."
28588,-1,Why bother?,"I heard from the old timers it was a great movie. After reading the reviews of a butchered DVD, I wont even bother ordering it. Amazon doesn't get their cut, a seller doesn't make a sale, I keep some money and the producer can do what Streisand suggested..."
28603,-1,"Good Vocalist,but sleepy time music","Amel Larrieux is a Really Good Vocalist&has a nice tune,but this album makes me real Sleepy Time. the Production&arrangements don't challenge or match the vocals that she presents. Amel should be having a Alicia Keys type of Career run now as to being stuck with tired formulated tracks by the numbers."
28605,-1,Mostly Siamese If You Please,"If you have a Siamese cat, this might be interesting, but only one chapter applies to the title claim of ""how to talk to your cat,"" and I suspect Siamese must speak a different language than other cats. This was written in 1978 and sounds old-fashioned in the style of writing."
28614,-1,"unscholarly, biased and angry",The problem with this book is that is wholly unscholarly. The author makes all sorts of extravagant claims against the Roman Catholic Church and almost always either fails to correctly cite the material or it is found to be completely out of context. There are dialogs that could be opened about Roman Catholicism but this author's work can only serves as an embarrassment for the arguments Boettner and his modern constituents are making. There are many more balanced and scholarly materials available throughout amazon.com and the Internet. I would suggest looking there.
28615,-1,Polemic,"I bought this book because it was given either one or five stars. So I thought it must be very (!) controveral. If you are looking for a scholary insight in catholic theology, you will be at the wrong place. You can get better books on this subject by evanglical scholars. I highly recommend the book of John Armstrong (ed.)""Roman Catholicism etc"". To get catholic theology right read catholic sources and compare it with the evangelical view. If you do this you get some new ideas and possibillities to interpret scripture. Especally if you compare the modern evangelical thoughts with the Early Fathers. There you can see protestant errors, but also catholic errors. For an honest seeker of information this book is too polemical, but it is not as bad as some of the (fundamentalist) catholic rewiewers said."
28629,-1,"Great Concert, Terrible Print","Take a look at the product artwork on the cover - they've even packaged this in a color that will detract attention from the RED wash that is evident in the still pics & that permeates this footage with virtually all other colors missing.I think this might've even been better in B&W.; They've remastered the the sound, but done nothing with the depessing dark RED picture. Over-priced too."
28631,-1,Not good enough,"I like David and have seen him live. The beginning of this book was pretty good, but then I just lost interest. There were the occasional laugh out loud sections, but it seemed like they weren't coming often enough to keep me choosing this book over others. So I say it just wasn't good enough."
28632,-1,Sedaris is better than this.,"I am unequivocally a Sedaris fan, but this book left me wondering if he really has much material left that worthy of being published. The strength of his first 2 or 3 books certainly earned him notoriety and a reputation for tongue-in-cheek prose, but the stories in ""Corduroy"" were simply dull and boring.I certainly can't recommend this book. Get ""Me Talk Pretty.."" or ""Naked""."
28634,-1,I Was Afraid This Might Happen....(2.5 stars),"From great anticipation comes greater disappointment. I don't even think that Sedaris was trying to pull together another set of unbearably funny stories. The settings and characters are certainly familiar, but here they are morbid, tepid, and even a bit contrived. His snaggletoothed humor is almost entirely absent; I didn't even crack a smile. In fact, I found myself cringing a few times. Oy.Will I unhesitatingly read David Sedaris again? Absolutely. I just won't suffer from the wait this time."
28638,-1,also disappointed,"Received the book as a gift from my mother. I echo the concerns of other disappointed readers. Only ""6 to 8 Black Men"" made me laugh out loud. He paints his family in an unusually unflattering light - I grew weary of reading about how much coffee and wine his mother drank. The story about Anne Frank's apartment seemed out of place.Still, I recognize and respect what went into the book, and, like another reviewer, find it provocative. I'm not willing to abandon Sedaris based on one book. And I hope to experience the audio version."
28641,-1,Not what I expected,"I was under the impression from just about every review of this book, that it was humorous in many ways, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I was WAY off. Its not funny at all, and its more like an autobiography of the difficulties the author had growing up as a homosexual. There were few instances where I could even chuckle at the writting and although I will admit the author has some talent, the book should not be marketed as a funny bunch of essays, it is a straightforward, somewhat depressing, look at a difficult life."
28642,-1,a huge disappointment to this fan,I have waited anxiously for any new work from this usually-hilarious author and made the mistake of buying his newest book as soon as it came out. It seems Mr. Sedaris may be going through a midlife crisis as the majority of the stories were very introspective and not at all funny. I was left with a feeling of sadness instead of the usual uplifting I recieve from the view of his unusual family and love lives. I would NOT recommend this to anyone looking for an amusement.
28648,-1,It's bland and offensive,"I despised the essay/story called ""Possession"" and felt that Sedaris has dropped to a disgraceful level of insensitivity. I can't find anything even remotely humorous about the Holocaust. I'm not at all saying he thinks the Holocaust is funny but I don't joke about it like I don't joke about slavery, wars or other examples of man's ability to become sadisic monsters. Who knows, maybe Anne Frank finds it funny from somewhere beyond the grave but I can't. I, too, have been to Anne's secret annex in Amsterdam. It was a place to mourn and a reminder to not be hateful in our own lives. I loved ""me talk pretty"" and even liked the quirky, selfish character he portrays himself to be but the stories in this book are bland and that single story made me feel immensely sad."
28649,-1,He thinks he's funnier than he is,"I used to wonder what all the hype was about. Now I know. Not much. David Sedaris has had a not atypical suburban kid life - he grew up alienated from his parents and family, he went to college and didn't do as well as he might have hoped, he started using and then recreationally selling drugs, he cleaned up his act, and he moved on to bigger things. He's got family members with quirks, and he's gay. And he tells you about them.Before you get this book or any of his others, go get David Rakoff's Fraud. I think Rakoff is superior to Sedaris here - Rakoff is a journalist so his subject matter is intrinsically interesting. Sedaris, if you don't want to hear about his family, or you think he just sounds whiny, you're out of luck. I wasn't bored out of my mind so 2 stars seems appropriate, but that's still 5 hours of my life I'm never getting back."
28650,-1,Not 10 Inches - Like They Say,"I owned a Farberware 10"" skillet already. It was made years ago and I needed to replace it because of a loose handle that constantly needed tightening. I was very happy to find this product on the internet, with a lid. I could not find a 10"" skillet with a lid in any store.After my husband opened this present for Christmas, he said it was smaller than our older skillet. I asked, ""How could that be? I ordered a 10 "" skillet?""We took out the tape measure. This skillet is a full 1/2"" less in diameter than our older Farberware 10"" skillet. I guess you cannot trust what is written on the box? Farberware must not care that their quality control (as the merchandise is made overseas), is non-existant?I gave it two stars because I do not like deceptive advertising of a product. It seems well made, but it is NOT 10"".I've lost faith in what is claimed on packaging. Bummer. I'll probably let Farberware know what I think."
28652,-1,"Why oh why don't you change, post -rock?","I purchased this album because a Wire Tapper compilation presented me with 'Flares' pt 3 or so, the ONLY stand out track on the whole album. I was expecting some complex sequencing, a little glitch core with drawn out guitars, with perhaps a somber or delicate mood. What I got was one original song surrounded by very poor reduxes of Explosions in the Sky, who also sound like poor reduxes of other bands, who sound like other bands etc. Sorry, but the melodies on this album are already outdated, as much as I appreciate the production value here [it does SOUND great], this album bored me with its seeming complexity once it was revealed to be startlingly simplistic."
28654,-1,Multiplying,I bought this thinking it would be great way to teach kids their multiplication but it isn't the case. When you press down on the buttons you can hardly see the answers. I remember them being a lot brighter. Very disappointed.
28658,-1,Makes Silver and Gold sound like Black Sabbath,"Bummer.Am I the first one to point out that ""No Wonder"" mercilessly steals the melody from ""World on a String?""Anyway, I'm doing what I did with Broken Arrow, Are You Passionate, Landing on Water, and Mirror Ball - teaching myself to like this album. Beacuse it's Neil, you know. And he's the king. And part of being a fan of Neil's is getting burned. But this is some third degree stuff here. Tepid, lifeless, by the numbers. Neil has never sounded so 'phoned in.' Auto-pilot. Take your pick from any of the rock crit cliches - this is grim.That said, aside from the production, some songs are quite nice the seventh time through.I guess it's working."
28662,-1,Mediocre stuff from a great artist,"As a huge fan of NY since the late 60s this is a very mediocre album..The painter and This Old Guitar are very fine songs but the balance is sappy stuff with cornball lyrics...now I am a sucker for sentimental songs but all of Neil's imagery is childish and actually boring....he has sustained a brilliant and creative career for nearly 40 years,and his recent Greendale CD was fabulous...but Prairie Wind blows through your ears without leaving much behind....can't help but wonder if this was rushed out for personal reasons....a real downer from my favorite song writer/guitarist/and singer..."
28666,-1,far fetched pablum disguised as art,"One more example of ther importance of connections to success. While there are some amusing things in this book, if you or I wrote it, it would never be published."
28669,-1,I'm not exited anymore.,"I ordered this thing and took the chance and I was let down. It's so lyricly boaring and musicly clitche. Same ol' stuff I've heard a million other times by a million other ""bands"". This is one of those albums that make you feel like running away from the EBM scene and becomming a hipster. Ok, not that bad, but this isn't anything would suggest. The next two album by IR that follow this are considerably much better, though still not five star records. Just stick to VnV Nation and Dismantled if you like future industrial music (or whatever). This is no place to start."
28673,-1,Watch Timecrimes instead,"This movie tries to do the same thing that Timecrimes did, by showing what would happen if you got stuck in a time paradox but it doesn't do it as well. If you want to see it done right, see Timecrimes instead. That's a five star film."
28676,-1,Frustrating,"I found this movie most frustrating and irritating like Groundhog Day - that must be the most awful way to go on and on and on and on... in a bizarre way the movie makers accomplished the task of getting the point across! Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea!"
28677,-1,not impressed,"Not impressed, slow moving and not a plot I was happy to watch. Expected something more exciting, but fell far short in my opinion."
28680,-1,"Great concept, poor execution...","Great concept for a book, but not well executed. Too many typos (Countesss Elizabeth Bathory, the ""Blood Countess,"" is listed as having the last name of ""Bathroy,"" just as one example), showing that the book was not proofread very well . The author also uses web sites and magazines for sources, many of which have erroneous information about these women.Better research techniques, and a decent editor would have helped immensely. I was very disappointed."
28683,-1,way too long !,"This book was great for the first 200 pages or so, and at first I could not put it down, but after that it was all downhill.. the same things happend over and over again.. so much drama about such stupid things ! It became boring and predictable. It was hard to make myself finish this book."
28700,-1,Kindle eBook more expensive than print copy,"I couldn't put this book down. It's a real page turner and kept me up til 3 am trying to finish it before I had to go to sleep. Full love/drama which is what I love about this one.While I found this book to be an excellent read, I am disappointed in the pricing. The Kindle eBook edition is $12.99 while the print version is only $10.88. eBooks cost essentially nothing to distribute, so why the eBook version costs more baffles me. This price difference made me so angry I refused to purchase this eBook or the print version and give the publishers money for ripping me off. I borrowed the print version of this book from a friend instead."
28713,-1,"Erratic results, great concept","Foremost, I like the idea a lot and having been using it frequently about a year (been refilling my own cartridges for 8 years). However, the results are inconsistent - sometimes it fills completely and other times it does not (even after repeatedly pressing the pump). My first choice is to try this drip system and let it sit for 2 hours. But I now always check the handy calibrations on the tank. When it does NOT fill, I revert to the manual syringe (yes, messy) filling. The Dataproducts system is quick, but not consistent."
28714,-1,Don't waste your time,"This book is one of the worst texts I have read on the subject of Quantum Mechanics. Griffiths presents the subject in a glib manner presenting the easiest of material in the chapter and leaving the student to drown in problems without a clue of how to proceed. If you ever need to teach yourself Quantum Mechanics, Use the Feynman Lectures."
28719,-1,Luke warm on the Boppy,"I'm not sure what the fuss is surrounding this product and why so many deem it a ""must-have"" I find that a regular firm pillow works just as well if not better. The width of the boppy is too narrow to support a bigger baby. The U-shape isn't especially comfortable to me. The other problem I've had is washing. They come with slip covers now, but if you ever need to wash the pillow itself, it screws up the distribution of the stuffing.I much prefer the My Breast Friend pillow: it has a back support and is adjustable. Very comfortable and gives the baby a wider and flater surface to lay on. Mine is the inflatable version, which is great - when you take off the cover to wash, you can easily clean the pillow beneith with just a damp cloth. My baby also like sitting in it better than the boppy."
28720,-1,Boppy Overrated,"Another MUST HAVE I was told. I think not. Pillows are much more effective in my opinion to prop up the baby while nursing. The boppy just wasn't comfortable for me, it was too stiff. I didn't feel like it really fit me - and I am not a big woman - size 8 before pregnancy, size 10-12 while nursing. I really think it is overrated and not necessary.I have heard good things about ""my breast friend"" I might try that one next time. But still felt like the pillows did the trick."
28724,-1,Thought it was a must have but.....,"Being quite tall and not petite, this pillow just did not fit well while breastfeeding, it put my son up to high. I had heard all the hype about this product and thought it had to be fabulous, but it just didn't fulfill my expectations. My son is now 4 months old and doesn't even like to be propped up on it for more than a few minutes!"
28727,-1,Wait to buy,"I urge mothers to wait to purchase the boppy. I was sold by all the rave reviews, bought the pillow and never used it. I had an 8 lbs. 9 oz. baby boy and found it difficult to nurse him with it. It got in the way. Now it just sits in a corner. I guess I'll use it when he's learning to sit up to prop him up with. I urge mothers to borrow one first to see if they like it before spending the $."
28729,-1,Never received,Never received it! Don't know why it never downloaded - so don't know why I got this request for review.
28734,-1,Lord of the Flies,"I was not a fan of this book because i couldn't get into the story line. I read it simply for school, not pleasure"
28740,-1,Page Edges uneven,"This really looks to be very cheaply printed. I am not a big ""reader"", this book was mandatory for a class that I am enrolled in. The edges of the pages are not evenly cut. Its like I cut the pages out, one at a time, myself and bound the book. Some pages are wider and some narrower. Not impressed and would certainly consider purchasing a higher quality next time.Not the sellers fault, but the printing company."
28750,-1,"Great book, but the author's reading is terrible","I love this book, but I wasn't halfway through the introduction when I realized how painful it would be to have the author read it to me. He sighs and breathes heavy in the middle of sentences, speaks in a monotone voice, and makes all the characters sound the same, which makes it hard to tell who is saying what during the book's argument scenes.Overall, great story that deserved a professional voice actor to read it - somebody who could have made the story come alive. Any nuance the author could have added through his own insight into the story was lost in the lackluster presentation."
28756,-1,Lord of the Flies,"We've just recently read this book at my middle school some of my classmates and I found this book to be unappealing. I thought it was actually a boring book even considering all of the violence. In my opinion, Golding picked a subject for each chapter and dwelt on it. I thought that this was a slow-moving book. Also the way he wrote things was kind of ""beating around the bush."" So my advice to you is if you do not have to read this book, don't."
28758,-1,am I the only one who didnt like this?,"I just finished reading Lord of the Flies in my gr. 11 English class and I wish that this book was not required to be read in school, because I do not recommend it. Although it was thought provoking, and at times you really felt for the characters, it was too grim a look at mankind. I entirely disagree with Golding's idea of mankind being inherently evil, and that made it hard to get into the book and also made it hard to believe. This was fairly well written, but I have read books that challenged my intelligence more. It is obvious that Golding wrote this book as a way of getting his point across to people, and you can see this because the reading comprehension is pretty simple and most people can breeze through it. I felt that it was borderline propaganda, and I actually regret that i have read it, but I didn't have much choice in the matter."
28769,-1,Lord of the Flies by Andy Lemmons,The book Lork of the Flies was an ok book. To me I thought there was too many stories going on at the same time and there was to many charcters that the author talked about. Yet it had good adventures I was not really thrilled about this book. If you are looking for an adventure type or survival book then this book is a good book for you.
28774,-1,Hello from Canada,"""Lord of the flies""The book in the beginning was interesting but when i reached the part when they go after ralph and piggy and try to get them,that's what i didn't undrstand. How could 13 or 14 years old kidstry to kill each other,and don't care.The book after all was not bad,it lets u read it even if your not interested. I like the way golding flies us from on idea to the another.for me i give it 2 stars"
28779,-1,Sorry to say...,"I am sorry to say but this has to be one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. First off whatever plot was meant was basically pointless, in fact the plot was basically non existant. The writing was focused on what the author thought probable, however this probability is highly unlikely. I would never actually want to read the book again."
28785,-1,I hated it,"I saw the movie and read the book. I thought it was realistic but horrible. It is gruesome, and the details of the killings are unnecessary. I rated 2 stars because it was a realalistic and made good conversation in my religion class. Send your comments of my review to my email please."
28791,-1,They cut the extras,"I dunno about the stand-alone Blu Ray, but the DVD of ""Otis"" has a ton of great extras (commentary, deleted/alternate scenes/ending, featurette, trailers, etc.). This version, however, has no extras whatsoever. I thought the point of Blu Ray was being able to jam more on the disc while maintaining superior picture quality.On the plus side, ""Dr. Giggles"" has never looked better, and this seems to be the only Blu Ray release of that film. Though it's weird that they've paired it with a completely unrelated movie made nearly 20 years later.If you're only interested in the films themselves, you can't beat the price. But the lack of extras is irksome."
28798,-1,"The sound, the fury, the mediocrity","This is supposed to be trail-blazing, genre-defining music? Sure, it's more interesting than anything your parents are probably listening to at the moment, but that does not make a great record. If you consider Puff Daddy a more innovative rap artist than Public Enemy and Eric B. then you'd probably also pick Moby over Aphex Twin, Orbital, Leftfield, A Guy Called Gerald, The Chemical Brothers and plenty of other Brits who have done more interesting, compelling things with this type of music."
28803,-1,More reliable resources are available,"Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material."
28804,-1,Needs work,"As a wheelchair user, I am always looking for a bag or pouch that I can use on the sides of my chair so when I saw these, they looked like they might work. On the plus side, they attach easily over the chair arms with velcro fasteners and are sturdily made from denim. On the minus side, the pocket is not deep enough and the bag tends to hang over the wheels, getting in the way when I'm trying to push myself around. The product description says they can be used for wheelchairs, walkers and bedrails. I think these pouches would work best on walkers. On bedrails, because of the shallow depth of the pouch, when the bed is raised to a sitting position, the contents of the pouch might fall out. It's a good idea but I think it needs a redesign. I would recommend them only for walkers."
28807,-1,"Lots of Stories, No Real Conclusions...","I purchased this book because I am interested in the topic of language generally. I found Sowells book to be basically a collection of anecdotal information strung together without any real conclusions drawn from his ""data."" The sample study was incredibly small, which might explain his hesitancy to cast any general conclusions. But ideally *some* analysis could have been done."
28814,-1,Boring,I only read the first like ten pages. It was super boring so I stopped. Glad I borrowed it from the library.
28816,-1,"Thorough but extraneous, colorful but blinding . . .","Wolfe is an extraneous writer. He wants to tell us about everything from the protoganist's deceased dog, buried three summers ago, to the aunt who died when he was a child. Each comes with a complete history. While some of these tangents of Wolfe's can be fascinating, most of the time it just slows the peice up and makes us want to move onto something faster, something with a better pace. With all this color, all these descriptions of extraneous subject matter, I think we as readers become blinded to the writing's main intentention. This can't be truer in the case of his classic, ""You Can't Go Home Again."""
28819,-1,"NO MORE SUNNY RANDALL, PLEASE","I have read every Spencer book written by Parker and both Jessie Stone books. I enjoyed them all, some more than others but as a whole I like all of them. I even keep them and read some more than once, which is rare for me. Now comes Sunny Randall. It is the worst thing I have read that Parker wrote. All about a privite eye who finds a fifteen year old for her parents and then decides to not take her home until she can find out why she ran away. Sunny uses her ex-husbands mob family to get her into places and to see people she cannot do by her self. Spike is the answer to Spencers Hawk, I guess. I had to force my self to finish the book. I understand there is another Sunny Randall out in Hardback, guess who WON'T be buying it. I know Robert Parker could care less what I think if this book, but, I wish he would stick to the Spencer books which he does so well. This is about the same as Spencer and Paul in Thin Air. The names have changed but not much else."
28822,-1,Formulaic and uninspired.,"I was disappointed in Family Honor. Yes it reads like a Spenser novel, is kind of a fun read if you're a Spenser fan (which I am), but here Parker takes out his Spencer cookie cutter and plops out a rather uninspired story. Nothing new here. If you like Parker -- his best novel is Love and Glory, which isn't a Spenser novel, but an excellent story."
28825,-1,THE MOST UN-CHICK LIKE WOMAN I HAVE EVER HEARD OF,"Seems like i've read this story before in a Spenser novel. Disguising the detective as a woman didn't fool me, and I don't think it'll fool many others. And Sunny was completely unbelievable. Although, RB Parker did manage to make her into a male fantasy: gorgeous, perfect body, guilt-free casual sex, completely self-assured...yeah right. Haven't met too many of hose."
28826,-1,Jack of all trades=master of none,"This CD would give me a headache even if the band had more talent and better material to work with. After all, why do I need to buy a CD to hear a mixture of classical-sounding elevator music, new-age sounding melodies, Pearl Jam-esque grunge, and screaming cuss-metal? I could buy individual CDs with each genre for when it suited my mood. Listen to all of them intermingled is annoying and not at all entertaining. If they had made one great song in the bunch they might be worthy of a small helping of forgiveness, but they couldn't even manage that."
28833,-1,It's okay.,"The hero is quite nice, but the heroine is a bit too odd sometimes. The repartee between them is good and there are steamy love scenes. But the secondary characters are weak or unintentionally creepy and the ""magic"" is silly, dragging the story down.A very mixed bag. If I'd read it more recently, I might actually lower the rating."
28837,-1,Poor Quality,"As mentioned by another reviewer, this Kindle edition is plagued by OCR errors. Missing apostrophes, added commas, odd capitalization.we know the publisher has a perfect computer file of this book. How hard would it be to use that as the basis for the Kindle edition? Sloppy workmanship."
28862,-1,Weeds and other trash,"This series, like its predecessors is nothing but trash. It is soft porn (and not so soft), derides all morals and sensibilities, and is an insult to one's intelligence. Steer well clear."
28874,-1,very dark period piece........,"The Girl, based on a Catherine Cookson novel, is a period drama set in Victorian times. While the sets, costumes are actors are all exceptional, the story itself is one of the darkest and disturbing ones I've seen.While in all probability more realistic to the times, Cooksons portrayal of a young girl, born on the ""wrong"" side of the bed, and her eventual life with her illegitimate father, and terribly sadistic stepmother is very hard to watch. Be forewarned-this is not a ""family"" film, as brutal beatings of children, forced sex, adultery, attempted murder, someones hand almost cut off in a ""man trap"", and many more throughly unpleasant scenes make up this mini series.In the end, I found no characters worth any empathy, in fact the ""heroine"" herself becomes so sneaky and underhanded that I for one wished she would NOT end up with the hero at the end.A depressing way to kill several hours and one I would not recommend.1.5 stars for the sets and costuming."
28877,-1,Fuse assemply poorly designed,"Unless you catch it, I've unplugged the until from a rental car and not noticed the end screw holding the fuse has come off and I'm left with a worthless cable after I discover the situation when I get home. Yeah it's my fault but it's still poorly designed -- I've had two other units just stop working (after the warranty of course)."
28879,-1,Very disappointed!,"Very disappointed with this item! First, when the knife arrived it obviously had been a return from someone else because the plastic was sliced open and the knife had been removed before. But, my son really wanted this for Christmas, so I kept it because I had not been able to find another one anywhere else. It was a Christmas present, and the leather sheath broke on Christmas Day after wearing it only about 5 hours! However, my son was very happy with the knife, so now we are trying to find another sheath for it."
28880,-1,Low Budget Campy Horror,"If you're into cheesy horror films, then this movie is a good rental. If anything, you'll get your money's worth sitting around with a group of friends and laughing at the cheesiness of it all.Perhaps the only two good things about the film were Chris Harmony's acting and the gratuitous nudity!"
28885,-1,Too disturbing for most readers,"Written in a claustrophobic, stream-of-consciousness style, this is a portrait of a young woman deeply damaged by emotional and physical incest. The broken chronology and distorted perceptions make the reader feel as confused as the protagonist herself. I had to force myself to finish reading the book. It might have been worthwhile if there were some character development and resolution of the protagonist's psychological problems. Instead I was disappointed by an apparent happy ending that seemed forced and unbelievable. Marble Skin may be well-written (apart from the contrived ending), but it's certainly not enjoyable reading."
28887,-1,Did not fit BCM carry handle,Just as the title says. This mount did not seat properly or at all on my BCM milspec carry handle. i think these are hit or miss.
28892,-1,hip hop?,"oh please, however catchy the beats are do not call her music hip hop,for some one who has been listen to it for years, calling her music hip hop is an insult."
28896,-1,really disappointed,"Sorry - I try really hard to read every book I start, but I could not finish this one. I found it predictable, silly, and it was not compelling or skilled. The writing was amateurish."
28904,-1,It is a Lambert movie,"Bad special effects. Lambert looked bored at times. The plot has a few holes. Too much cleavage. Bad fight scenes. Beowulf can do multiple black flips and spin in the air and yet the monsters can still hit him! The fact that Grendel's mother is pregnant doesn't really play into the movie, but they keep bringing it up. It is not the worst movie I have ever seen and I pretty much got what I expected so I'm not completely trashing it. The weapons were cool."
28908,-1,Mixed emotions,"I enjoyed this book for it's view into the cloistered life of a nun- pre-Vatican II era, but the problems I perceived from the author's vocation seems to have resulted more from personality conflicts and clashes than anything. I couldn't relate effectively to her plight and wondered why she stayed as long as she did. I was also bewildered by her declaration that she didn't believe in the resurrection of Christ. I'm still scratching my head over that one since she obviously believed in the virgin birth (which requires alot of faith as well) and the divinity of Christ or else why the heck was she there in the first place??? I think there was more going on in her head when she decided to leave the convent than she leads us to believe, especially considering her more recent books like The History of God. I think maybe one of the mother superiors in her book had it nailed when she said that karen had a problem with intellectual pride."
28910,-1,Unimpressed,"The pan is heavy and appears well made, but even cleaned per the directions it's never had stellar non-stick performance. Because of it's poor initial performance the first few times I used it, I haven't really used it enough to comment on durability. I don't find it to be a very handy size, either, but I can't really fault the pan for that one. Overall, I've had much better non-stick performance out of much less expensive pans."
28912,-1,Excessive exclusions of important potential entries renders this reference of little value.,"Obviously in a field as large as mystery writing some limits had to be established to produce this relatively small book, somewhat longer than 200 pages. However, in this case the limits are so restrictive as to make this book of relatively little value to the mystery enthusiast.The book is organized alphabetically, with a section for each letter of the alphabet and an index. However, there is no section for X, and the sections for Y and Z are only a half-page each. The entries present are well written, but there are simply too few entries. For example, although the book's title is ""Whodunit?: A Who's Who in Crime and Mystery Writing"" by my count there are only three authors listed under A and seven under T.Because of the excessive pruning of significant and even important potential entries, this is not a book than can be recommend as a reference."
28914,-1,Not one of Hillerman's best efforts,The characters are familiar to Hillerman fans and the plot and story are good enough for a decent read. But publishing houses obviously do not proof read books any longer. There are numerous typos that distract the reader.
28918,-1,unfinished,"Tony Hillerman is my favorite author. I re-read his earlier books while waiting for the next in the series to arrive. I visited Navajo Country just to be near the land and people he brings so completely to life. Hunting Badger made me fear that there will soon be no additions to the stories of Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. Much of the plot seems calculated to tie up loose ends, to settle story lines. I read that Mr. Hillerman has been ill, and that he recently lost a beloved brother. I hope he isn't contemplating retirement. Please, Mr. Hillerman, send Jim and Joe to us again soon."
28921,-1,"Not great, but I'll work with it.","I'm hoping this tastes better over time. There is definitely a metallic aftertaste. It is strong. Like ""maybe I just ingested something I shouldn't have"" strong. The effect is lessened when combined with other spices. I used a no salt blend (Kirkland brand) and added Nu Salt to give the blend a little more salty flavor. It worked OK, but not as tasty as I had hoped. I'll likely try out other similar products. If they all taste like this, then I'll just use it sparingly with heavy doses of other spices. It is definitely worth it to try to find tasty lower sodium options. Salt kills."
28925,-1,Where is the quirky fun?,This was okay but I already own Pizacatto Five and Stereolab. I miss the innovative loops and samples - like from the first album.
28931,-1,Good Story - Bad Editing,"I've really enjoyed reading the book, but the frequent spelling/word errors are starting to distract from my experience. At one point, Hawkfrost says he's Thunderclan instead of Riverclan... ugh... and various other grammar mistakes. Plus, the characterizations are beginning to run together. Oh.. and don't even get me started on things being mentioned that are completely ignored as though they are never said for books and books. At first, I put it off as: It's a book for kids... but good grief, dragging them out as far as they have and having characters acting inappropriate from what they've been told as though it never happened,... characters who have in the past been known to pay attention and dwell on such things...ugh. I'm going to finish this set of books, then that's it."
28943,-1,NOT THAT GREAT,"AS A HISTORY BUFF, I WAS DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS. IT'S CHEAPLY MADE AND NOT VERY IN DEPTH. LOOK FOR SOMETHING BETTER."
28944,-1,Unskippable ads,"The pre-roll ad is unskippable. And long. And obnoxious. I paid for the DVD, I shouldn't have to wait through a 2 minute commercial to watch it."
28946,-1,Babe is fine - Universal ruins the DVD,"When placing Babe in the DVD player I was not able to fast forward, jump to the main menu, etc. until _after_ all the movie previews on the DVD were played. My daughter actually stood in front of the TV and started to cry because she wanted the movie to start. Shame on Universal for ruining what is supposed to be a fun experience. I've paid for the DVD - I should have full control over what is shown and not be forced to watch yet more advertising. I'll be asking for my money back on this DVD."
28947,-1,Jayne has lost all sense of whimsey,"I have enjoyed Jayne's older novels like ""Wildest Hearts"" and ""Trust Me,"" but her more recent books have been plot driven without likeable characters. I especially don't recommend spending $25.00 for a hardback. Wait for the paperback or better yet, check it out of your local library. I already donated my copy."
28948,-1,end user,"I can't get modulated video signal on a digital TV with channel set @33 or any other channels. With the help of a combiner I am able to watch modulated video and regular cable on an analog TV set. Also there is a problem of switching from one mode of signal to another(ie.:IRC,HRC,STD). If I am able to do the switching is somehow by luck although I followed exactly what the instruction says."
28955,-1,Nothing but fluff,"I have a hard time understanding why there are so many positive reviews here. This book is nothing but fluff. If you are anything more than a newbie, it's got nothing and if you're a complete newbie there's just enough information to be dangerous. She promises periodically that more information will be given about actually growing certain plants, but that information is never forthcoming.It's full of personal anectdotes that have little to do with the topic at hand, the tone is condescending and she encourages the use of poisons. She anthropomorphizes plants in an embarrassing way, telling a story about a poisonous plant she accidentally purchased as if it had a personal vendetta against her and her family. Her attitude toward plants goes beyond respect into something slightly off-kilter.The book is good for a giggle. If you must read it, make sure you have a firm grasp of both gardening and herbal magic first. Otherwise you could well follow this lady into lala land."
28960,-1,More reliable information is available,"Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material."
28961,-1,A Disappointment,"I've long been a fan of Robert B. Parker Spenser books but, even though I watched them, I didn't really care much for the Robert Urich ""Spenser for Hire"" series. Too 'goody two-shoes' and 'television-ized.' That's why, when I found these Joe Mantegna movies, I enthusiastically thought that someone made some Spenser movies that were a little more 'raw' and true to the books. What a disappointment! The stories were accurate enough, but Joe Mantegna as Spenser? A former cop and boxer? I don't THINK so! I found him, and the actors filling the roles of Hawk and Susan to be completely unbelievable and wrong for the parts. These movies really made me MISS the Robert Urich series!"
28965,-1,Outdated!,"This book was good during it's time, but now it is outdated. The book is designed for SCWCD 1.3, and did a great job covering all the topics. However, Sun Microsystem discontinued SCWCD 1.3 on December 2004. So, if you are like me, disappointed with head first books and looking to be certified as fast as possible, do yourself a favor and buy the second edition of this book. You won't regret it."
28973,-1,Don't spend your money on it,"While the book have the basic stuff just fine, and contains some other not original but very good basic technices, I find it too basic, even for beginners. The book have some major annoing stuff like the babbling about history, the authors have tried to connect everything to older traditions, but it all sounds like fairy tales we all heard before...Not up to date and new elightning facts that makes us say wow.As for beginners, there are other good books that contain alot more info, better written and are alot more fun to learn from."
28978,-1,not particularly good,"A set of very unusual dysfunctional grown-up children who seem to be incapable of relating to their father. The story proceeds as if it's being written as it was being filmed. Unfortunately there's really no character development behind any of the people involved, so we don't know why they turned out the way they did. It's a sad movie and I'd recommend avoiding it."
28989,-1,Ehhh - it's ok I supose,My roommate had one that was brand new in which I left water at a bowl in the pot for maybe 10 minutes and the water alone cooked away the protective layer inside the pot and stained it white. Since the pot was not mine I had to replace it at $60. I would have never paid that much if it were for myself.
28994,-1,GREAT Customer Service; but this clog isn't so great,"I purchased these clogs for my daughter for Christmas, having purchased other types of Betulas in the past and having been very happy. The material these are made out of is just not great. The clogs arrived lookig like someone had already worn the suede off around the edges. It just isn't good material if you want your shoes to stay looking nice for very long. I would recommend the leather Betulas... those can stay looking nice and you can at least polish them. Skip the suede!This company has wonderful customer service, and I would purchase from them again. Nice return policy!"
28998,-1,fun but not a lot of teaching substance,"My kids liked the story but there was only one page that really focused on teaching good nutrition. Smoking cigaretes is introduced in the book also. I think that should be addressed under the drugs topic, not nutrition. I'm sure there are better resources for teaching kids about nutrition."
29000,-1,Limited Use - Missing Warnings,"This product appears to be well designed. However, when you get it you find that there are numerous (21 to be exact) warnings and cautions not mentioned online. Some are obvious but others severely limit its use. Max speed (55 mph on the box, 65 mph in the instructions)and cannot be used with sun roof are two biggies. I returned the item without trying it because of all the limitations"
29001,-1,Rust,"The outdoor fireplace is well equipted with a rack and a trough. My one comment is that it rusted almost immediately and had to be spray painted with special heat resistent paint. We like the idea of an outdoor fireplace. It also looks very caldron like and midevil. Not very 2007.More functional, and I would like to say practical, but the engineering in design isn't that good. All in all, not worth the $180 some odd money it cost."
29003,-1,Don't over cook!,"I had just received this Garlic roaster and couldn't wait to try it. I followed the directions and instead of putting in in the microwave for 5-6 minutes, I put it in for only 4 minutes. The smoke started pouring out of the microwave vent and the entire head of garlic was coal black and the roaster was ruined. A friend told me to try only 1 1/2 minutes and, although the roaster now has a burnt smell, I tried it for that time only. The garlic turned out soft and usable, except I will now have to replace the roaster with a new one. Whoever wrote the directions couldn't have been further off with the timing. Just be careful! I would probably cut down the oven time to 30 minutes instead of the recommended time, also."
29008,-1,Not worth buying but its worth renting.,"The game is fun for like 3 or 4 days. First ide like too say the good: the blood and gore is good, multiplayer deathmatches are fun, the single player mode is good for about 2 days, and that is about it, about the good. Now here is the bad: very poor and blocky graphics,its boring, if your one of the code buffs the codes are good but make the game more boring, and every time you start a new multiplayer levels you have to go back and set the codes back on, the controls you start out with are horrible( my advice is to change it to the right-hand move setting so it controls like goldeneye),during multiplayer mode when you try to shoot someone far away you dont hit them and when you try to shoot them up close they have block heads and are impossible to hit becuase they move impossibly fast!, and finally you will be bored with it in 4 days."
29010,-1,"OK, Not Great.","My advice on this game is to rent it. It's not worth buying. The animation is junky, plus the areas are so limited. If you are going to buy a game like this, get Doom 64."
29012,-1,The ever wary eye upon French society,"Simenon is always an OK read. As time goes on, maybe one of the unforseen feats of Simenon, is that he has left a series of quite accurate images of French society as he experienced it. In this book we discover the world of Hotel Majestic in Paris, seen from the perspective of the employees. We are also a trip to Cannes and Cte d'Azur discovering the life of prostitutes there. The plot of the crime Maigret is unveiling in this book is quite sophisticated, perhaps a bit to sophisiticated?"
29014,-1,Close...,"I haven't quite figured this book out yet. At times it seems like a compilation of different authors as the tense seems to change from chapter to chapter. There's some neat information in the first half, but as some have already pointed out the second half is generic in it's dog care.While the pictures were in themselves nicely done, 80% of the dogs shown were overweight and didn't even match the standard set on the inside covers of the book.Of course if you don't like nylabones stay away. If you are interested in rat terriers this seems like the best first attempt but you can get more accurate images and information on the rat terrier sites on the web."
29020,-1,"Love Buffy, but...","I LOVE Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and Angel...but these 3 books were SO boring to me. I could hardly get through them."
29029,-1,Lump of coal in your stocking...,Big names + poor history + silly storyline + idiot dialogue = world war 2 garbage time. Avoid it.
29043,-1,Like being at a drive in...,"The film played on countless ""dusk till dawn"" horror bills at drive-ins through the early 80's, and this disc does a pretty good job of taking th viewer back to those long gone days of cheap thrills. The picture and sound quality are only about average, just like the drive-in, the only other thing you need is for someone to park their car outside you living room and honk thier horns during the nude scenes. And the movie? Well it's about average as well. The plot concerns a plot to get an inheritance and a bunch of greedy heirs. A true B movie on all counts, but not without a certain trashy value, those who spent warm summer nights watching this flick when it was paired up with the likes of ""Don't Answer the Phone,"" and ""Point of Terror"" may want to give this reasonably priced disc a look."
29057,-1,THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL FILM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I Spit On Your Grave, Kids, A Clockwork Orange and Showgirls. What do these movies have in common? They are all a part of the great chain of CONTROVERSY. I spit is most likely the worst of the Rape-Victim-Revenge films and probably the only one that has no regard for dignity. I really advize parents to keep thier children away from seein this film as I saw it when I was 15 or 16. Hell, I just turned 18 in February and I've seen all the above films that I mentioned. I'm not proud of this fact but I'll tell you what, education can come from all mediums, even the most explicit."
29071,-1,not great,"Cool idea BUT, this isn't really worth it. I bought it for myself but would never use it. On a positive note my 14 yr old liked it. I wouldn't recommend it for an adult."
29073,-1,Discover a beautiful region of France,"If you want to discover a beautiful and wild French region through the eyes of a Scottish writer, read Travels with a donkey. Stevenson, before he became famous, depicted his journey in the cevennes, with his donkey ""Modestine"". Rediscover the excellent style of a young writer about to become world-wide-known."
29079,-1,not worth it,"If you have never used a flat iron before, don't even bother.This product does not come even close to the results I get when i use my flat iron. A waste of money, to say the least."
29081,-1,Not impress at all,"I read the reviews and thought ok, I'll try it. I was very disappointed. A lot of the reviews said it was good for African American Hair. BEWARE! It almost pulled my hair out. WAY TOO MUCH STRESS ON MY HAIR! Thank you"
29082,-1,not powerful enough,"In a nutshell, not enough wattage to get the job done in a reasonable amount of time. I'd also appreciate a shorter cord. I love the idea of this device, the straightening element works well for me. My hair is coarse and very wavy, always frizzy unless I straighten, so I really wanted to like this product. My friend who has finer, thinner hair than mine loves it. However, the 700 watt power makes styling take forever. I may as well dry and then iron, since it would be faster. Still, I'll probably keep this for travel, since it's very portable."
29084,-1,Does not straighten,When i used this all it did was smooth out my hair and added flips at the ends. It does not make you hair bone straight. As soon as you go outside your hair is puffy again. It does the same thing as my old $20 styler did. I guess using this to dry your hair and then use something else to straighten it would work. But why should i have to buy a second straighter when this thing suppose to do it for you. I also think the model on this box actually has naturally straight hair that is why it is so straight and smooth. Luckily i took it back and got a complete refund. I guess i will stick with my old straightner.
29090,-1,Ehhh...,"I really wanted this to work, but my fine hair was blown off the brush. My hair continued to be wavy and frizzy after use. It's going back."
29095,-1,Hairdryer,"My dealings with Nicholas at Foward Motion has been more than exceptional. The item purchase was not exactly what I imagined, but Nicholas worked with me in finding a product that met my needs. I commend his services and patience in working to resolve the needs of a customer.Respecfully,Yolanda"
29096,-1,Not worth the money,"This product isn't any better than the 10 year old curling brush I have under my bathroom sink. The kind girls used to feather their hair. It's a hairbrush that blows hot hair. Not at all what I thought it was going to be. You are better off going to the drugstore and getting a hot air styler ,some with changeable brushes for 10 to 15 dollars."
29101,-1,"A spotty, disjointed, incomplete mess","Fortunately I rented this from Neflix and did not buy it. I would not recommend that anyone who knows anything about or has any interest in American Hardcore buy this CD. First, it is impossible to document the history of this genre of American music without mentioning and focusing somewhat on the Dead Kennedys. DK was as important, if not more important, than Black Flag. This is a mess and should be avoided."
29104,-1,not so great,"An ok attempt at explaining what really happened during this era. Most of the concert footage was pretty unsatisfying for someone who was there. Bad Brains were depicted well and Keith Morris is always entertaining. The movie title references years 1980-1986 but I am not really sure why the only Gang Green concert footage was from 1987. There was no mention of Dead Kennedys, Social Distortion or Misfits which seemed strange."
29106,-1,Takes a long time to dry,"It is nice to have a fountain pen ink that is water proof. However, in this particular case it is at the cost of having an ink that takes forever to dry. This it almost impossible to use for left handed people, and one must accept the fact that when writing on multiple pages, there will be ink smears on the pages that touch each other. It's definitely good to have when signing documents or checks, but one can use a simple permanent pen from any office store for that limited use. Buyer beware!"
29111,-1,Interesting Piece Of Info....,"Did you know that Motown's studio band played on this album and on ""Whispers""?? On ""Higher And Higher"", that bass at the beginning could be no one other than James Jamerson. I knew that there was some reason that I keep coming back to this, this recording always stuck with me ever since I first heard it upon its release in 1967(particularily the title track). And Jackie is at his peak on this recording, I feel. For me, Jackie's performance on the title track and the Funk Brother's playing gives it 5 stars(Please ignore the 2-star graphic, that is an error. 5 stars!!)"
29120,-1,Terribly Disappointed!!!! Curse Words!!!!,"I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine. Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere. Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie. These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal. I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons. I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking. Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.Concerned in Alabama"
29122,-1,Really just 2 full-screen versions,"Well I bought this DVD yesterday and was really excited to finally see the ""theatrical widescreen version"" of the film, not having seen it since 1986. So I pop in the first disc and start playing. I then start to realize...this isn't a true widescreen version! It's just the full screen version reformated to play on a 16x9 television! And actually when you compare them side by side, the widescreen version cuts off some of the image.Sure the colors are separated more but really I think I liked the colors of the original better. Sometimes the new version just seemed...washed out. The original had deeper reds and looked more natural. I was kind of used to Unicron being almost orange and not yellow.Some of the extras are good, but not overly exciting. If you are looking for the true theatrical widescreen version prepare to be disappointed. Oh well now I have 2 full screen versions and 1 full screen version that plays natively on a widescreen tv."
29127,-1,this movie is available on iTunes!!!,it's less than 20 bucks....so don't go spending anymore than that in this wonderful economy we have!!Cheers..Tony(NYC)
29136,-1,Good opener but I quickly lost interest,"whatever these reviewers are on, I want some. This movie dragged. I kept waiting for something cool to happen, but they just kept talking to eachother over the mic-bla bla bla blaaa. I wouldn't know if the conversation was good because I just fastforwarded all of it after a while. A real bore."
29138,-1,FRequency,"Very strange to follow. Too much forward and backwards in the plot. Like the suspense, probably won't watch again.Too shifty."
29146,-1,Very disappointing,"We've had the game for almost a year and we've only played it when it arrived. Frankly, my 5 year old daughter and I didn't find it as much fun or as stimulating as expected based on the positive reviews. Main complaint is that the pieces are INCREDIBLY flimsy (has a home made feel) and one has to manage that aspect instead of fully focusing on the important things. My secondary complaint is that the game is barely more involved than the basic memory card games that cost much less and no where near as challenging as Zoombinis software, which we love. So, this game is not much fun, not well made, not very stimulating, yet it carries a relatively high price - avoid it!"
29149,-1,The Prince of Central Park,I watched this movie when the title caught my attention. As a young kid growing up in a highly disfunctional family I read a book with the same title. This was my favorite book through my entire youth as well as highschool. It was my escape.The movie is loosely based on the book in the charactors and the plot. However the book was so much deeper in the respect of how JJ learns to live in the park. As soon as the Kathleen Turner charactor is shown you know exactly where this thing is going. JJ never seems to be more than a few days at summer camp sleeping in a really cool cave.He never gets sick from eating out of garbage cans. He never breaks into Taven on the Green for food. He never build a tree house using ropes because he can't hurt the tree.This book is out of print but if you can find a copy or get it at your library READ IT! You will remeber it forever.
29153,-1,Overly basic,So basic I just felt like turning it off and going back to bed. None of the tranquility I expected with doing this. Sleep was better
29156,-1,Doesn't Suspend my Disbelief,"This book is totally impossible, rather than implausible asmost of the X-files are"
29160,-1,Spock's mistake! What happened?,"Spock's Beard is a great band ,talented musicians and great music but something went wrong here,,a terrible experiment or something but man what a disappointment! Overall poor songs,no powerful tunes,no punch,no great lyrics,just downright bad. Hate to say it but the guys messed up on this one!dont waste your money on this one! Very poor effort!"
29162,-1,A Rarely Missed Target,"I won't rehash information found in other reviews of this album. I've recently bought a number of Spock's Beard albums and am shocked at not only their sheer talent, but their ability to convey it in such pleasurable ways. It's all a question of style, and Spock's Beard has it...but just not on this CD. This one is a departure from their normal format, the songs being much shorter and the overall demeanor much 'harder'. The hardness comes from guitar distortions liberally distributed in too many tracks, and although I can normally deal with hard (prog) rock just fine, I find this release too obnoxious on balance. Unless you are distortion freak, stick with many of the other SB albums, many of them are top notch."
29169,-1,Truthful and Disgusting,"I agree...this does happen all over the world...there are kids out there who live and act like the very kids in this movie. But just because it is a reality does not mean that I have to like the movie, and I definitely do not. My friends and I did some crazy, stupid things in high school, but we did not behave this way. My goal as a parent is to raise my son in a caring, loving, yet disciplining environment where he can make his own decisions but understand the consequences of his own actions. Hopefully (without sounding naive) I can give my son the tools to make good decisions so he does not find himself in these same situations."
29174,-1,Perhaps one of the most depressing films you'll ever see...,"Ive always said that I have yet to see a horror film as scary as real life. This film shows a documentary, brutal and hard look at real life for teens. This horrific look at life film deals with drug abuse, sex, aids and some violent aspects such as a scene where a gang of lads beat up a skateboarder in Central Park. All the characters are unlikable and the movie makes you feel empty and sad, as this stuff really happens in life. In particular theres a scene where a group of boys on a couch are all sharing a joint of weed and the boys only look about 12. Be cautious when watching this film is you are easily shocked or offended. As a teen I found it sick and unjustifying. But it deserves credit for delivering controvery to film."
29175,-1,Amazement and Shock,"I was bored, amazed and shocked by this movie. I was amazed that this was shown.... and sad at the listlessness in these young people's lives... and at the fact that these kids had nothing doing in their lives. I was laughing at the comparisons of the boys and girls talking. I was shocked at the callousness and indulgency of the rape scene. It still leaves me with anger. What this showed was the lack of respect for women and also every woman's fear of being raped while in such a vunerable space. It was amazing to see the beginnings of such addictive behavior and obvious at the lack of personal time and care in their homes. A very raw movie."
29180,-1,"Good writing, terrible printing","This is an exciting story for the era, with mystery and violence and romance and childhood innocence. It is extremely melodramatic at times--purposefully, no doubt--which adds to the humor of the book. Easy read. This particular printing, however, is completely terrible. There are typos, missing punctuation, and backwards quotation marks. I would recommend this book to lovers of 19th century literature, but please, buy from a different printer!"
29183,-1,Used book really used!!,"I like to buy used books from Amazon (great prices). They have always been in excellent condition. I have to say that this is the first time, I was not totally satisfied. Although the book was in decent condition, it was not in the condition that I am normally use to with Amazon books. The cover was wrinkled from bending and some of the pages were still turned at the corners and not even fixed before it was shipped. I wish maybe having a picture of the book might be helpful although I realize that this is not practical. All the more the description needs to really apply to the book being purchased.I will give it one more chance before I stop buying used books. Just be leery of used products."
29194,-1,Waste of time,I think this is the worst Jane Autsten book I have read. I had to force myself to finish it and was very tired of it by the end. The diologe is long and boring. I won't read Emma again.
29204,-1,"Extreamly Dull, If Anything!!!!!","I am 11 and a 1/2 years old and simple love books that take place in Europe in the 1700 or 1800's. However, this book was absolutly boring. Out of all of Austens works, which are not all to exciting themselves, this has to be the most boring and drawn out. There are long pauses of nothing but tea and long walks, and once in a while Emma will set up one of her friends. This match does not last long, however. Personaly if I were her ""friend"" Harriet, I would think myself better off without her companionship. To my knowledge Jane Austen wrote this ""little gem"" for the prince of England whom she did not exactly admire. I wouldn't be surprized if his didn't admire her so much after he finished reading it. If you are looking for a exciting and gripping book do not choose Emma."
29206,-1,Pointless...,"Obviously, the only reason Disney had for making this movie was to test their newly created CAPS animation system, because other than a few impressive uses of that, this forgettable sequel has nothing more to offer. While The Rescuers remains one of the studios most beloved animated, this one simply falls way back being one of the most uninteresting and bland Disney releases of all time."
29213,-1,Lacking a lot for home inspectors,There are a lot of areas that home inspectors need to know that are not mentioned. If you know nothing about inspections then you could learn a few pointers from this book. If you have some knowledge already then there are other books that would be a much better choice than this one. Some areas in the book were wrong. I would read the other books in this field before buying this one.
29223,-1,A Children's Book,"I found this book to be too simple. Perhaps children would like it (I myself love animals), but it wasn't thought-provoking enough.The characters' names somehow bothered/annoyed me. I liked the idea of cats running about in clans, but I simply did not like their society, their family itself.Erin Hunter has a tendency to include far too many characters. The first Warriors book I picked up had an entire list of characters. A sort of dramatis personae (or felidae). Cats upon cats. Is it really so necessary to throw in so many characters?"
29229,-1,When does this series pick up?!,"I have read all of the books in the series up to this point. Their short and pleasant, so I might keep up with them even if they are written a bit sloppily. I'm just a bit weiry of them at this point. Just about nothing ever actually happen everything is spoken of. Basically,the book plays out like this:Darren: Mr. Crepsley, Why is the sky blue?Mr. Crepsley: Well, Daren...Daren: Mr. Crepsley, how come blood is thicker than water?Mr. Crepsley: Well, Daren...Come on! How can a book be propelled by a kid asking a bunch of questions?! You really can tell that this writer is new. He's clueless sometimes. It's like a history lesson! I'm in no hurry to read the other books in this series."
29238,-1,Such promise; such disappointment,"Perhaps I will be accused of owning tickets to ""Short Attention-Span Theatre,"" but my best efforts to plow through this lush but frank effort were all for naught. Hollinghurst, as advertised, possesses a wondrous facility for words; even the most mundane acts are described with a fluent accuracy that the reader is inclined, often, to exclaim, ""yes, that's it. He said it perfectly!"" Nevertheless, lovely writing does not a compelling novel make, and that, combined with a penchant for a relentless gay-dominated, ""where's my next man?"" theme, simply left me at the station. Others may choose to take this ride, especially if first chapter anal male sex is your metier, but even this tolerant reader was looking for more than the constant longing found in Nick's loins. Fine writing can be found elsewhere in countless more compelling efforts."
29247,-1,nice but could have dont better,Works as advertised it has three lift stations on it to accommodate any size of bike. Though if has no foam edging for the floor (hardwood) so it likes to slide a little when peddling fast or standing while pedaling. Is also a little bulky think I could have found something a little smaller
29254,-1,Not my idea of DVDA,A drum machine and a synthesizer. Poor quality. Just because the instruments whizz about the room does not excuse the lack of quality. In my opinion a waste of money. Please buy it so I don't feel I am the only one getting robbed.
29256,-1,For Advanced readers only,I am a proficient MSXML coder but i can't get what I want (knowledge about .Net XML programming objects) from this book because the author habitually relies on advanced concepts from related technologies to explain things. So unless you are a pretty competent .Net programmer and already proficient in ADO.Net/ADO you will struggle to understand this book and struggle to understand the significance of what you are being told and why. I gave up and resorted to looking for articles on MSDN. Undoubtedly there is good stuff here but Mr Esposito writes as an extremely knowledgeable person for the already extremely knowledgeable person only.
29257,-1,another poor one,"Another very ordinary 'Poirot'. The Belgian sleuth is travelling in the middle east with a group which includes a horrible American matriarch.This horrible bit of goods gets the chop and because she's such a nasty piece of work she deserved it.Its very hard to get involved in the story when there is absolutely no sympathy for the victim.Anyway, Poirot sets out to solve the murder and he does but with one of the real cheat endings of Christie's career . The reader should at least have an outside chance of solving the murder but this one gives you no hope. Not great. (1938)"
29267,-1,Misleading Cover,I bought this DVD for my toddler because he loves Grover more than any character on Sesame Street. I was disappointed that Grover nor Cookie Monster who were both on the cover were in film at all. Very misleading! Also a bit heavy on kids talking and singing their favorite songs not as much characters and muppets as there should be. Not very entertaining as far as Sesame Street DVDs go. Better spending your money on another title.
29269,-1,not for moral readers,"I know this is something of a ""classic,"" but readers should be forwarned that in this book, the hero frequents prostitutes and seduces a married woman (actually he tries to seduce three of them). The affair takes up about 50-100 pages with references to it later in the book as well.There are good parts to this book. The very beginning is interesting, and one can find interesting material throughout the book. But at a certain point, the main character starts visiting women of ill repute and starts seducing married women. It was at this point that I started wondering, ""What kind of person was Abe Cahan if he could write about such matters in such detail? And what kind of morals did Cahan have if he makes this affair seem somewhat wonderful, rather than dastardly?""Be forewarned!"
29280,-1,Ulysses,This book is a struggle. I don't know where it's going and can't decide if I want to be there at the finnish.
29290,-1,Italics are capitalized,"Substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable. Also, multiline verses are collapsed into one unbroken line."
29291,-1,Ulysses Audio Book,The problem with this audio book is that the sound is not balanced. The dialogue comes through loud and the right after dialogue the reader's words are so soft that it's difficult to hear. This audio book is not easily listened to even in a quiet car.
29293,-1,buy in store!,"i highly suggest that you buy poker chips in store so you can easily touch the chip and examine the quality. poker chips are all about the feel in your hand. you can't determine that from a picture from the internet, they all look similar but can feel lousy once you pick one up. also, it's easier to return to a store than internet. these chip sets are heavy & expensive to ship.please note; heavier poker chips feel better. 11.5g is the minimum weight to buy. although, i suggest you get 13.5g or 14g chips. good luck on your game!"
29295,-1,Poor Quality,The quality of the case is poor. It does not close well. And there seems to be poor structural integrity of the case. Some of the chips are dirty or damaged somehow?
29302,-1,A rental!,"A good laugh, but only if you have seen a lot of ""date movies"" - which is the only true way to see the humor in this movie. I was surprised that they dug back as far as they did - I expected it would be just current ""date"" movies. Went back to Pretty Woman and even Say Anything! Definitely a rental - wait for the dvd!"
29309,-1,Theater vs DVD,"I saw this movie at the theaters and it was awsome, funny as can be, so when it came out on DVD i bought it. Not quite so funny this time. I don't think it was so much that I had seen it before as much as it was that with out a crowd laughing alongside of you it's just not as humourous. It relys hevily on gross out humor and parody of some movies that weren't that great to begin with."
29312,-1,"umm, try something else","keith plays like a pig here- he practically wastes peacock and dejohnette, they are allowed nothing else than the opportunity to accompany jarrett's yowling and over-indulgent right-hand lines. for some serious piano trio playing, check out mccoy tyner's early albums for impulse, bill evans' live at montreux, chick corea's now he sings, now he sobs, anything by paul bley with gary peacock, or keith's own first albums with charlie haden and paul motian"
29315,-1,average product,This cd is nice yes. but it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I wouldn't recomend this item.
29319,-1,2 stars for what I was able to stay awake through........,"Ok, this isnt fair. Roger Ebert and that other dude loved this so naturally I gave it a try. Jeez people, do NOT try to watch this if you are the least bit tired. I was lost after the first 10 minutes. I feel that I am a fairly intelligent person too so I just don't get it. All I have to say people is at least rent this sucker before you buy it. I was 2 steps from buying it and I would've been crushed if I had. So so so so hard to follow and keep up with!"
29322,-1,"Slight, predictable romantic comedy","A government official (Cary Grant) tries to reconnect with his children (Mimi Gibson, Paul Petersen, and Charles Herbert) after the death of his wife. The daughter of a symphony conductor (Sophia Loren) goes on the run to escape her overbearing father (Eduardo Ciannelli) and takes a job as nanny to the children. Romantic comedy ensues.If there is any reason to watch this film, it is the chemistry between Grant and Loren, who had been in a real life relationship not long before filming began. The situation, however, is highly contrived and the scriptwriters (Melville Shavelson and Jack Rose) are all too willing to cast all logic aside for the sake of some rather slight gags. Characters do not behave in a consistent fashion, their personalities changing as the script requires so that the story can hit every predictable plot point on the way to its happy ending."
29339,-1,Nature of the Beast,"It's quite interesting in that is shows what makes the people of this nation tick, by looking at their traditions and examining their ideologies. It addresses the breakdown of traditional communities and human interactions. But the conclusions this book comes to should be quite horrifying to any RATIONAL Joe. The tone of the book is that we are all social animals that live, interact.... and work together in a community based on responsibility to care for others. It is true that we are social animals and that recently people have grown cold to each other...but the solution is not to enslave people with some ""inherent responsibility"" to others. The book's states that we will only become ""human by accepting our essential poverty as a GIFT, and to share our material wealth with those in need.""......this is the most anti-American book I've read which tries to fix the social climate in the most horrifying ways. This is SOCIALISM disguised as a Traditional American Way of Life."
29345,-1,Horrible Acting,"I read the play Romeo and Juliet in my Shakespeare class, and thought is was a very good play. But when I saw this movie I was very dissapointed. The acting in the movie is just HORRIBLE.On all the parts, it is either overdone or underdone.And on top of that,they cut out alot of dialogue toward the end.I think there is a reason why Shakespeare wrote these plays for the stage. I would reccomend the version with Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Daines over this one."
29346,-1,Romeo And Juliet,"I think this movie follows the play very well, but scene 13 is horrible. There is full nudity which is not necessary. I have seen movies and plays and am shocked that a G rated movie would show not only Romeo's rear but Juliet's breasts. I would never recommend this version for students of any age."
29351,-1,Airplane2,"Very dissapointed, but then sequels are very seldom better than the origional. I can highly recommend the origional, one of the funniest flying movies everRon Nash"
29357,-1,This book is very light...no substance,The good stuff is elsewhere ($ -> Rational) is the basic premise of this book. I would have to say that if you want an introduction to RUP then this is definitely that but no more. Don't expect it to do more than familiarize you with the general concepts of RUP. Almost every chapter ends with which tools you should buy from Rational.
29366,-1,Madonna Deserves Much Much Better,"The main problem with ""The Next Best Thing"" is that the movie is very flat and some parts leave you thinking ""what?"". The acting was terrific but I didn't feel that Madonna's character and Rupert's character were best friends at all, in fact Madonna's character was extremely underdeveloped. Her not allowing Rupert to see the boy came out of nowhere, and was totally stupid. Madonna is a good actress but this movie won't help that aspect of her career at all. ""The Next Best Thing"" is bogged down in melodramatic nosense that hides it potential to really make an important statement about the changing reality of families. And the ending! I was so mad-I thought ""This is totally twisted-it is too stupid!"". If you want to see a good Madonna movie, skip ""The Next Best Thing"" and grab ""Evita""."
29376,-1,At least you have more than a ticket stub...,"I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater. While the special effects are excellent, the storyline and acting is bland and predictable. The DVD gives you some extras such as behind the scenes segments. Save your money and just rent this DVD if you must see it."
29377,-1,Dont Bother.............Wait for it to play on local cable,"i loved the first mummy movie and had very high expectations for the second, even though i missed it in the theaters. The day it was released on dvd, i ran out to get it to find my local store sold out. My roomate however manged to snag it for his collection and upon watching it that nite, was glad that fate stopped me from buying a truly overrated , summer popcorn flick.special effects were a plenty but def. less striking than the first one, the computerized scorpion king at the end was almost as bad as the computerized satan at the end of SPAWN. the story was kinda weak. But its a sequel i guess.Dont waste your time. rental only or wait for it on TNT."
29379,-1,A pretty boring ride.,"Don't bother with this lousy sequel, because unless you're five years old the poorly written characters, dialogue and The Rock just don't impress. CGI's alone can't make a good movie and unfortunately that's all that seems to sell in Hollywood anymore. Also check out the awful CGI of the Rock towards the end of the movie, does it get any more fake?"
29391,-1,the mummy returns,"I find it very hard to believe that some people enjoyed this movie so much that they gave it a five star rating. If this gets five stars, what do good films get?!. This makes no sense. The film is poor. Hre are a few thoughts...Acting: I've seen better acting in fifth grade musicals.Plot: Plot, what plot?Dialog: Laughable.Character Development: The characters are so static that I felt like I was watching a soap opera set in 1930s Egypt in which many things arbitrarily exploded.I will praise this film in one way: it is better than Hollow Man (but then again, sitting in an empty parking lot watching a dumpster for 90 minutes is more satisfying than watching Hollow Man). In closing, my solemn hope is that the mummy won't return again."
29395,-1,Don't buy this DVD,"Unless you want to line Universal's pocket, I'd advise you to stay away from this video.Don't get me wrong though, I like the movie. It's pretty good escapist entertainment. I don't try to read to much into such movies. It was fun. But Universal is most likely going to release this title in an Ultimate Edition package just like the last one. They also created Ultimate Editions for American Pie, Meet Joe Black and a few others. So if you like this movie wait for the Ultimate Edition."
29409,-1,Haven't read!,"This book is not what I expected. Therefore, I haven't read any of it. Maybe one day I will pick it up again."
29415,-1,oldham's worst album,"I love everything else he's done but this album has always seemed LACKING to me. It's got a few great songs but a lot of it seems RUSHED, a bit too jokey and loose, and the lyrics are definitely sub-par compared to ARISE THEREFORE."
29418,-1,Whew! I'm not the only one...,"When I read this book as a child, one of the messages I got was that even pretty china dolls get spanked (not just us plain brunette children with short noses). Another message was that I should be happy with my family because they didn't threaten to abandon me.As a parent I now wonder what message of ""family"" this book would give adopted children or any children. Children often fear abandonment due to their misbehaviour; why would we want to encourage that?I decided not to keep the copy of ""The Lonely Doll"" that was given to us and I could not in good conscience pass it on to another family.By the way, I find it disturbing that the Hornbook review refers to a ""good spanking"".They are lovely photographs and I liked the cover."
29432,-1,Thought it would filter smelly water...I was wrong,"I am guessing this would work perfectly with heavily chlorinated water, such as city water because it definitely did NOT help filter any of the sulfur smell from my well water. It also did not filter any of the iron oxides because after a month the white color where the water comes out is now orange. Also immediately after I put it in the silver holder where the actual shower head fits in broke, it's plastic which seems stupid considering it is a hand held shower head which would cause you to remove it multiple times through out it's shower head life....wouldn't you want that material to be durable???? Not a good buy for me, I was very displeased with this item, if your product states it would help with sulfur and iron then you better make sure thats what it does...."
29434,-1,"It worked fine, then broke","I had no problem with this item while using it. The white plastic that the filter is made of is very weak. As I was unscrewing the hose from the plastic wand, the bottom screw part wore down and now the hose will not stay attached. Be careful when screwing/unscrewing because the plastic wears down very easily. The product becomes defective afterwards."
29435,-1,Great Shower Head UNTIL IT BREAKS,"I love this shower head! My skin and hair feel better, and I am less itchy and dry. No chlorine smell anymore. The problem is that after the one year warranty expires the plastic parts crack/ break off so that you may no longer be able to use it. It is very cheaply made. Three separate pieces have already broken in less than 18 months."
29440,-1,Low Quality,"I bought this for my son, who has bad asthma at times. I thought I could use it to listen to his lungs, but the quality is very bad.The diaphragm is plastic, and I really have to strain my ears to hear normal breath sounds, let alone crackles or wheezing.Upon recieving it, I found that one of the tubes was bent from sitting in the box for too long. It is irreversible.Although the stethoscope looks all right and works realtively well, I don't recommed buying it just because it's cheap."
29443,-1,not what it could have been,"I was very excited about this book when I read the back cover. Unfortunately the book doesn't live up to its potential. I liked the main plot but the author didn't spend much time describing the characters, the scenery. She left you hanging. The romantic scenes left me cold. I wish she had taken the time to really develope this story. I would pass on this one."
29444,-1,"Poor stitching, doesn't hold up","I recently purchased 8 of these bras and although I loved the fit, I'm afraid that 4 out of 8 have had an identical problem in stitching at the center top part of the bra. All of them have unraveled stitching during the first wash causing the underwire to poke out. All were hand washed and were hung to dry so I'm afraid it can't be blamed on machines. I'm greatly disappointed"
29446,-1,A Change for the Worst Indeed,"Just to let you know, this does not sound like Killswitch Engage or As I Lay Dying. It Dies Today was a brutal metalcore band and they had a unique sound to them. Now, the singer has lost all the brutality in is voice. And without that brutality, this album has nothing to let itself stick out. I honestly enjoyed the first two song a little bit. But then, it got boring. There were no masterful bridges or really butt-kicking guitar riffs. ""Bridges Left Burning"" is my favorite song from them because it has one of the best endings I have ever heard in a song. This new album has absolutely nothing like that. It's become formulaic and that's why it's boring.I honestly don't understand what happened. I really enjoyed ""The Caitiff Choir."" Now, I can take change in music. I understand completely if they change their style a little bit. But they just lost everything I loved about It Dies Today in this album."
29447,-1,nonononononononononononononono,"This band used to be exactly what I was looking for; amazing riffs, brutal breakdowns, and heartfelt lyrics. Now, all I see is a band just trying to cash in on what used to be an underground scene. Too many bands (Atreyu, All That Remains, Eighteen Visions...) are taking hardcore to the mainstream, but that is not a good thing! I used to love what hardcore was about, and I wouldn't mind the change if it wasn't so crappy! All I see in this cd is a once great band's sad attempt to gain control over a dying scene. If you want my advice, don't waste your time or money on this radio-friendly opus. It makes me sad, thinking about how many people think this is real metalcore. Wake up people! Pop-core is taking over, and most people can't tell the difference between the two!"
29454,-1,Too Different From the Previous Games,"I received this as a gift. A week or two later I gave it to a friend because I didn't want it, it's nowhere near as fun as previous Burnout titles. So many of the things that made those games fun has been taken away, and this game feels far too repetitive and one-dimensional to offer much else on its own. I was bored with it after an hour or two, I certainly feel bad for anyone who paid $60 for it."
29455,-1,Screwed up a great franchise,"First off, I've played Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge so I have some experience with past games. Somehow they managed to mess up a good thing, as after playing this for about an hour or so I was already frustrated. Instead of just picking events you want to play, you have to drive around to the one you want. & considering how huge the map is, it's more frustrating then fun. & a lot of times I lost races just because of glare from the sun (yes, I have no idea why they'd put glare in the game.)Honestly I'd just play Burnout 3 or Revenge, they're more fun than this game will ever be."
29457,-1,Five stars? For real?,"Johnnie Taylor sounds alright on this, but the band is terrible. Out-of-tune, missing cues, and generally screwing up what should be a good CD. And you can hear Johnnie get madder and madder until, by the end, it sounds like he's glad it's over with. I have to imagine the reason this was not released back in the day the was that the band is embarrassingly bad. I feel bad for Johnnie Taylor listening to this. Five stars, y'all? Are we listening to the same CD?"
29460,-1,"Good, but it dragged","Over all, I think the only truly funny moments in the movie was when Norton and Stiller were children. This movie is over two hours long, that is just a little too long for a comedy. It dragged quite a bit."
29461,-1,Great book but..,"This is a great book but it lacks scientific evidence and it rests it's theories on one experiment conducted by the author, the experiment itself was hardly done under the strict standards of the scientific community, he didn't even have a control group, by what is he comparing it with!! I can see why so many people can get sucked in by it but the empirical mind will see it for what it is. It does have intresting theories but with very little (if any ) concrete evidence."
29467,-1,DEPP COULDN'T SAVE THIS ONE,"This film portrays large scale drug dealers as guerilla marketing experts. It's long on make-up and period costume and short on cool dialogue or good acting. Hispanic actors portray Columbians using exaggerated accents and they appear more middle eastern than latin american. Good cameos by Ray Liotta and Pee-Wee Herman. The film is based on one convict's memoir, and it presents an interesting point or two, but everything in this film has been covered before, in better films."
29473,-1,Highly Disappointing,"A good old boy with high hopes of getting into a life of crime rises to the top and lives the good life before experiencing marital problems, doing some jail time, and eventually becoming a paranoid cocaine addict as the walls of his decadent lifestyle come tumbling down around him. Anyone familiar with Scorsese's GoodFellas will recognize the similarities and do themselves a favor by watching it again instead of this copycat. Blow is a fair enough film for those who aren't too choosy about what they watch--it seems unfortunate, though, to waste time watching it when you could instead be seeing the highly superior films that it borrows from (GoodFellas, Boogie Nights)."
29483,-1,Not the Better Translation,"The Matthew Ward translation is inferior to the translation by Stuart Gilbert. Using the French ""Maman"" does nothing for the reader of English and, in fact, detracts from the quality of the reading experience. Compare the last several lines of the two translations, and you will find Gilbert's much more powerful, even lyrical. When I first read Camus' book, which is my favorite novel, only the Gilbert translation was available, and it blew me away. When the new improved version came out, I read it and tossed it in the trash. Gilbert, however, makes Camus' lines sing with electricity. If you can get the older translation, do so."
29509,-1,Lorna Doone,"This movie is centered around a doomed love between two young people from bickering families. The movie is extremely slow with the first five minutes showing two people on horseback. There doesn't seem to be anything pulling the movie together to make you want to watch the ending. The basic theme and plot is an excellent storyline, but there is something lacking. Overall, I was expecting a romantic love story and instead found a dull way to spend 2 hours."
29513,-1,Lord Jim,LORD JIM - I couldn't get into it - rather boring and difficult to follow.Perhaps I will give it another try at another time.
29518,-1,too esoteric for my taste,"Maybe something lost in translation. More of a ""thoughts on life"" than a novel. Hope this helps. Lots of better aviation books too."
29523,-1,The comedy does not mix with the drama,"In ""The Wood"" ""Get On The Bus"" and ""Soul Food"" the filmmakers was able to balance the comedy with the drama but in ""Kingdom Come"" nuthin works...One second there is a dramatic reminiscing about the death of an unborn child and in the next Jada Pinkett starts screaming and tries to be funny (which she definitly is not)...I like Jada Pinket in ""Set It Off"" and in ""Jason's Lyric"" but u find yourself wanting to strangle her character in this movie...Not even LL COOL J, Vivica A Fox or Whoopie Goldberg can save this movie from being a disaster...When making this movie they should have chosen either to make a comedy or a drama.The movie is kind of like a 90 minute commercial for the church mixed with Drama and strangled comedy."
29532,-1,disappointing,"I agree the book is quick and easy read. But I disagree that it was a romantic tearjerker. It is obvious that Patterson is a man writing about a woman. Before I even started it I figured out the plot, the ending and everything in between. One that really annoyed me was the fact that only one man was in the story with Jennifer and of course they must fall in love. I was surprised in myself, I cry easily over anything romantic and loveydovey - but this did not touch me. He used stories or sayings that are quite trite and disappointed me in lack of imagination. (The jar of sand and rocks - come on how many times have we heard it before) I was hoping for more from such an acclaimed author, but he left me with nothing. I am sure by next week I will have forgotten all about it. If he writes another I am going to pass it by, like I would recommend to others about this book."
29537,-1,Eh,James Patterson lost his touch in this book. The romance seemed too forced and the plot didn't flow as smoothly as you would expect it would from a Patterson novel. The fact the the reverend is shacking up with a married women is never discussed. Jennifer becomes romantically involved with a man she knew when she was too young to remember him and the apprehensions about becoming involved so recently after her first husband's death are only lightly discussed. The story seems too forced and Patterson should stick to mystery thrillers.
29538,-1,Predictable and Unrealistic,"This book was an easy, fast read, but the story line was very melodramatic and predictable. There was no depth to the story. The romance was a little too sappy."
29541,-1,Let's compare two books,"First of all Sam's Letters aren't the main story of the book. The main story is Jeniffer's love story and the letters has nothing to do with this book. If you compare ""Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas"" with this book lets see what'll happen:1= Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas2= Sam's Letters to JenniferLove story 1 Excellent 2 GoodReading the diary/letters 1 Excellent 2 Waste of timeThe story outside diary/letters 1 Excellent. 2 ExcellentEmotions (cry, laugh, hate, etc.) 1 Excellent 2 PoorBook's end 1 Excellent 2 Poor"
29544,-1,Sam vs. Suzanne,"I'm not going to be too hard on this book, because I knew what I was getting into. I took the plunge based no my experience with Suzanne's Letters to Nicholas. This book did not bring forth the same reaction from me. I cried and was moved for days based on the before mentioned book. This novel didn't bring me to that place.I appreciated the story but felt it predictable. To be fair, I read Suzanne's at a different time in my life, and perhaps I was more emotional and less jaded toward predictable storylines.In any event, if you were going to select one book to read between Sam's or Suzanne's, I certainly suggest Suzanne's."
29545,-1,Sam's Letters to Jennifer,"This is far from even being a ""fair read"". I'm an avid James Patterson fan, but Patterson is riding on the coattails of the tremendous success of ""Suzanne's Diary"". I found this book dull, predictable, and written as though a novice was putting out a first book. What a waste of money. Patterson is a writer worth following, but he lost me on this one!"
29549,-1,Sound Quality,Sound quality of the discs is poor. Seems like nothing is done to improve the audio quality of the old recordings with modern digital processing techniques.
29554,-1,Nice shirt-- ugly logo,"I wanted a Mississippi State Bulldog shirt, but the bulldog is ugly.Be sure to look carefully at the logos before you buy. The shirt is great and the seller was wonderful."
29557,-1,A weak film,"I don't care if those zombies look real or not, this film isn't particularly scary. It's moderately suspenseful, but has no eerie scenes that raise the hair on the back of your neck. And despite what many others say, I still think the zombies in Day of the Dead are a better looking design then this Night of the Living Dead remake. Most of the problem in this film is the acting. The only one that's actually good is Tony Todd as the hero, Ben. His character remains mostly calm and cool and tries to help the others with him. However, the rest of the cast I can't say much. Patricia Tallman was not bad but also wasn't very good. If you want to watch a good zombie movie, watch Dawn and Day of the Dead."
29560,-1,Obsolete,"Obsolete remake, indeed. From the very beginning this film is a bad joke. The terrible non-stop screaming from the women makes you want to see them become zombie-food as fast as possible. Barbara's brother in this film is an i.d.i.o.t., blablaing his text down already in the arriving-scene inside the car. George must have thought: Well, let's have Tom bullfrogging his ego with a remake, it will always be... this. I don't wanna be mean to Mr. Savini, I really appreciate his work, his acting in some films too, but this here: Was a mistake. Or, I miss the point and this was meant as a comedy, but nevertheless, I say it doesn't work."
29564,-1,Not a complete product,"I was disappointed because the video noted a directors cut for the movie, which is my favorite selection, but when I try to see it the movie just goes back to main menu. I have always liked the movie but am not happy with the product because there are selections missing."
29565,-1,Not for everyone,"If your main objective, is the study of human relationships,social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing otherpeople, this movie is for you.Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors. Just,a nutty story, and enfatuation of the author of the script withpeople, relationships, seduction, etc.This is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant. Not true.Just that, perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more funfor some people than others."
29566,-1,"Good actors, awful script","I was warned that this was a bad movie but rented it anyway, figuring that a movie with Ashley Judd, Hugh Jackman, Greg Kinear, and Marisa Tomei could not be all bad. I was wrong, wrong, wrong!The story is disjointed and pointless; the characters were terribly underdeveloped and shallow. None of them were really very likeable, especially the men.I realize that the movie was from the book ""Animal Husbandry"" but the cow and bull stuff just did not work. The whole movie was just plain excruciating.What also did not work was the love triangle, perhaps because both men were slimy weasels. Who would want either of them, cute though they are?There are many better romantic comedies out there......unfortunately I cannot put this movie into that category."
29575,-1,Wonderful Disney classic but disappointing version (Pinocchio 1999 Gold Edition),"This was undoubtedly Disney's finest work, however the 1999 ""Gold Edition"" of Pinocchio is a disappointment. Not only was this transfer taken from unrestored film elements but they optically enlarged the picture to fill a 16:9 HD screen. By changing the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio to 1.85:1, they managed to cut off the top and bottom of the picture, resulting in a very grainy image.With no extras other than the original theatrical trailer, my question is: What qualifies this to be a ""Gold Edition""? My advise is, pay a few extra dollars and get the newest edition, it's worth it."
29579,-1,Not a good video for younger viewers,"While Pinocchio may be considered one of Disney's classics, some of the scenes/content in this older animation would not be shown or considered appropriate in today's children's movies. Gepetto is shown smoking in bed. Many of the characters smoke. Young boys are brought -- as a treat -- to a place where they can smoke, ""drink"" (something frothy like beer or root beer), and act very destructively as much as they want. The boys are tricked into thinking this is a fun place to go but are turned into donkeys and sold to work in mines -- never again to see their families. In the end, old Gepetto does get his wish. Pinocchio is a real boy. And old Gepetto gets to share his bed with the young boy. While all such scenes could be used for discussing appropriate behavior, I wouldn't recommend showing this movie to children. I made the mistake of showing this to my 4 and 2 yr olds. This is one those films I won't show over and over."
29580,-1,Sent wrong item,"I've seen this movie, it's great, however the item I thought I purchased was NOT the item I received. I am still waiting for a refund or an exchange. (the movie I received is formatted for European DVD players, not USA)"
29594,-1,Classic movie,"Movie was good but the delivery was poor. Movie feed continuously stopped & started, So far not a fan of the service"
29595,-1,Disappointing reflections on a life,"I found this book boring and disappointingly wretched. Some of the good insights the author shared were overwhelmed by a drawn out book of what seemed like incurable self-pity. This mood unfortunately permeates the book, preventing the reader from seeing someone who is learning about herself and God through the hard knocks of life. As the book progresses, ""inner reflection"" turns into a continued wallowing in the quagmire of the past, leaving the reader annoyed rather than sympathetic. Furthermore, this is one of those books that needed an editor to prune it before it went to the publishers. The book is 205 pages long, but Bondi could have said everything she needed to say in 1/3 of that length. Her repetition is annoying. This book has potential that a good editor could make use of, but as it is, it isn't worth reading."
29599,-1,Mediocre at best,"I will not review this based on the book, as I was never a big fan of the book anyways, but on the film itself.Mostly, I simply found most of the characters to be bland and lifeless, with the notible exception of the villian Febre, and the plot and dialogue to be fairly weak and unexciting.The swordfighting skills displayed in the movie were dazzling, but (as another reviewer also mentioned) considering that everyone appeared almost identicle, it was a little hard to tell at times who was fighting whom. Also, while again the fight scenes were dazzling, there was no practicle reason why some of the more over the top ones were even engaged in. I am referring mostly to the fight outside the tower on ropes (why didn't someone attempt to cut D'Artagnan's rope instead of engaging him in an ariel fencing match?) and the fight on the ladders (why would Febre give up stable ground to fight D'Artagnan on unsure footing?)."
29600,-1,justin didn't do justice,"i felt this was just a mish mash of scenes. it didn't flow nicely along and the star could no way handle the lead. after seeing MAN IN THE IRON MASK, you saw the unity of the musketeers, something i didn't get out of this. 5 of us watched it together and in the end we all agreed it was pretty boring."
29603,-1,Laurel & Hardy Perils,"The Further Perils of Laurel and HardyI received this item this week(March 7 2008) & it was one I did not know was avalable & saw thru a link. I have the other items in this Youngson series from other publishers late last year. This one is poor to, say the least, with faded & washed-out images although the sound is OK. The grain is very high and contrary to another review, PAL TV in Australia in the 1950s & 60s did not look anything as bad as the images in this DVD. The other Youngsons that came out last year were better although the highest priced one did leave a lot to be desired in picture quality also but not like the Further Perils. If only Warner bros would buy more of these things for extras on their great DVD releases then we would have restoration similar to what they have provided on at least one L&H; DVD set. But to have this title in the collection gets us to more completion of the Youngson compilations on DVD."
29604,-1,not effective,"I was looking for something with progressive relaxation. The script of this cd basically tells you to go to sleep over and over again, more annoying than relaxing."
29607,-1,Received a used set,"Nothing fundamentally wrong with it, but the manufacturer's original box had been opened before and rather clumsily taped back together, and the ""aluminum"" case is covered in small scratches and dents. I don't have the time to return the set for replacement since it was bought as a gift for an upcoming occasion. Disappointing."
29609,-1,DON'T BUY THIS SET!!!,"When I ordered this set, I thought it was a great deal. But, the first time we tried to use the ""shaker"", we dropped ice into it and it shattered all over the place. The glasses are nice though, haven't been able to use them yet due to having no shaker. Now we have to spend another $8 we spent on this set, to get a new shaker. Not that big a deal, just be warned...."
29630,-1,Do not buy if seal is broken,"Imagine my dismay when I, much like a wide-eyed little girl on Christmas Day, eagerly unscrewed the cap to my very first container of Uranium Ore only to discover...that it had millipedes crawling around in it. Hundreds of them. And they're all radioactive, so of course they're each about as big as my cat. And with TWICE the legs. No thanks to you, Uranium Ore Inc, I have to knit god knows how many millipede snow booties. I mean...I have to. They're my pets now. They'll probably vomit radioactive bile all over me if I don't appease them.Plus, as soon as I got this thing in the mail, the Libyans were all over me. And I gotta knit snow booties for THEM now."
29631,-1,Power my spaceship this wouldn't!,"Homesick for planet Dagobah I am. Fuel for my spaceship I need. Bought this product last year I did. (To raise the funds, many years of signing autographs at Geek conferences it took me.) Hundreds of containers I purchased. Melted them I did, fuel rods to make. But, sadly, power my ship they would not. Too low-grade. So for the foreseeable future, stuck here on Earth I remain."
29633,-1,"Ok ore. I only got a pebl. Thi s ore is barley radioactive and ""cold"" at best","This ore isn't too active. It only has 433 counts a minuate. This a ripoff, double the price you can buy high grade uranium ore off of ebay that emits 130,000 counts This ore is barley radioactive. You can find watch hands more radioactive watch hands insted. [...]/ the ore here is a joke."
29645,-1,A slight twist on a cliched genre,"""What Women Want"" is merely a slight twist on the cliched genre of romance-comedy, adding in the unique aspect of Mel's ability to hear women's thoughts. This idea had enormous potential, and potential to be funny. But this was not the case.A few cute jokes, a strange scene of Mel dancing in the bathroom in pantyhouse and lipstick, and the obligatory cheesy make up with his daughter at the end of the movie after a rocky relationship. We all saw it coming.It's a good date movie, but little else."
29653,-1,What Women Don't Want!,"What Women Want was a smash hit when it was released but this romantic comedy is unfunny and way too long. Mel Gibson gives another solid performance but I just couldn't relate to this film and I am a woman! Helen Hunt was so over-rated when this film was making millions of dollars at the box office but jeez you never hear anything about her anymore, her ship has sailed. This is a movie you rent or borrow from a friend, not worth purchasing!"
29658,-1,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"I realized from the title this was not a how to poker book but figured it would be something along the lines of anthony holdens book big deal but i was very disappointed with this book.It cover the authors poker games with his buddies in some off the wall home games (granted i am slanted more towards holdem)Other chapters dealing with a poker cruise and his dealings with a woman poker player hitting him up for advice,a chapter about internet poker dealing with a lot of rules and regs dealing with them in the USA.Also has a chapter about books dealing with gambling mostly by Dostoyevsky.On the back of the book it talks about the author being in the world series of poker and i was hoping it would have a little more to do with that but it had maybe three or four pages dealing with this.This was one of those books i keep reading hoping it would get better i felt it never did if you have not red anthony holden's book big deal try that one i could not recommend this book"
29661,-1,Complete Idiot's Guide to T'ai Chi and Qi Gong,I don't find this DVD to be idiot friendly and I feel I must have bought the wrong DVD/Book. I thought it would be easy to follow and it isn't. The title is very misleading and I don't know if others have had the same problem with this book/DVD.
29668,-1,Not impressed,This book was VERY well worn and the pages are falling out. Not happy at all.Will be more careful about buying used books in the future.
29670,-1,It's not the Monte Cristo story - it's just a brief overview of it,"I only give this book 2 stars because I love the story. But I can't rate this edition higher because... well, to say that there are chapters missing in this edition would be to say nothing. I have read the original: it consists of two volumes each one of which is twice as thick as this book! Because chunks are take out, a lot of times you can't quite catch the story and figure out why things went the way they went. The story of Cadrousse and Andrea is missing completely, the reason why Villefort had a change of heart is not clear, the story of Danglars being kidnapped by the Roman bandits, Danglars' daughter running away from home, the results of Monte Cristo's visit to the telegraph... and that's not all! Good 3/4 of the original story is completely missing! It's sad that classics are disrespected in such an outrageous way."
29672,-1,"Fabulous Book, Lousy Copy","Not a bad translation, but AVOID AT ALL COSTSThis is an abridged version, and as such a waste and a slap in the face to the author's original vision.I'm doubly upset because I didnt notice this was abridged till I already bought it, and was already 200 pages into it."
29676,-1,"Abridged version, buyer beware.","This is the abridged version of the Dumas classic.Having not read the original yet, I can only compare itto The Three Musketeers. Dumas' writing style losesenergy in the abridging process. The reader ought tobe aware that the story has been simplified and summarized.If you want the true flavor of Dumas, order the unabridgedversion."
29678,-1,"Careful, this one's ABRIDGED!","This isn't a review so much as a warning; I never read the book once I found out that it is an abridged edition. It says so across the back of the book, but there's nothing about it on Amazon's page. I sent the book back and received a refund. If you want to read Alexandre Dumas's complete masterpiece, find yourself another edition."
29680,-1,"what I bought, not what i expected","Count of MC is quite possibly one of the best books ever written. This 300-450 page novel does not do it justice. A lot of passages have been edited out and in some way translated extremely poorly. As a fan of Dumas or just a reader I would NOT recommend this book, instead go and get the 1000-1100 page version, idk if they make it in a softcover though, but that edition is EPIC.This is like watching a movie in fastforward, you miss a ton of the most important vital conversations/scenes b/c you're only skipping through for the action, and then just as you're about to get interested it'll end.Great for highschool book reports terrible for people that actually enjoy reading."
29682,-1,Thumbs down,The first time I watched these years agoI liked them. Today they seem a little outdated??Just did not enjoy them really. Thumbs down.
29683,-1,"""Some people count, and some don't""","The stab at Ayn Rand was the only really enjoyable part of this movie. The rest is just flatulance. The songs were good, but wouldn't you agree that they were a little too 80s to be part of the early 1960s? Jennifer Grey is believable as the love-struck adolescent; everyone else is so-so. If you want a good Patrick Swayze film, see ""Ghost."""
29685,-1,Summing up the plotline:,"Basically, a nice, wholesome girl from a good, caring family looses her virginity to a male prostitute, helps a female prostitute get an illegal abortion (which almost kills her) then WONDERS and is ANGRY about why her father is worried about her and doesn't want her going near the aforementioned people.Well duh.....The soundtrack is decent; I suppose that's worth another star"
29694,-1,Only got one bowl!,"Only one of the four bowls got delivered to me and by the time I got online to complain, this item was no longer in stock and it was more trouble to return it than to settle for 1/4 of the product I paid full price for... Such a shame too, as i do so love that one bowl!"
29699,-1,"Interesting world, claustrophobic writing","While I don't regret purchasing this book, I found the writing style very claustrophobic. It was sometimes unclear what was happening and how everything worked. The drawback to such a finely detailed world is that it's difficult for the author to introduce all the content we need to know in an interesting way. I found the characters actions somewhat unrealistic, perhaps because I didn't know enough about the class and race dynamics involved. The author is a perfectly competent writer, but I just didn't like her style. I'd recommend reading excerpts before buying to see if you have the same reaction."
29703,-1,Not so good,"I bought this book a while back but just now got around to reading it. I'm a fan of luna but I wonder what they thought when they were reading this. Its really confusing in the beginning throwing characters in there that dont have much of an explaination since they aren't human. It would have been better for me if there were more details about their society since its other worldly like, to be honest I dont feel anything towards the characters. If one of them died, I'd be like oh well I guess. The main character is double sided, like she wants to still be friends with Severn, yet killing him at the same time?? Its mainly lacking alot of explaination. But I will trudge on and finish it and probably read the others since I already bought them, which I know regret. I had high hopes from the 5 star rating i saw. Just proves to show I need to read the first one before purchasing the books that follow after. Hope this review helps."
29704,-1,Should've been called Above and Beyond Annoying...,"Kyla's behavior through out this whole book came across as irrational. When she wasnt talking to herself about how much she still loved her dead hubby, she was actting selfish and just plain self absorbed. When she finds out about Trav's lies, she then turns into giantic, rightous bitch.This book would've been half way decent if the heroine could've been more lovable or more reasonable.. her love for her dead hubby came across as unbeliveable.. if she did love him al ALL at any point in her life.Get ready to spend your afternoon annoyed to all hell, if you do decide to try this book. Not one of her better books, at all..."
29707,-1,A Classic Love Story?,"Don't be fooled by the inscription on the cover. This book is classic only in the Harlequin Romance sense. The premise could have been interesting if the story itself wasn't so annoying. The main characters are a man driven by an obsession and a compulsively grieving widow. I felt like handing out referrals to a good psychologist. The language is stilted and slightly off-putting. There are a few moments in the book which could be touching, but were handled ineptly by the writer."
29708,-1,A thoroughly dated movie,"Man, what a bore. I watched it because of all the accolades this movie has received over the years. Maybe it was good years ago, but this movie has not aged well at all. I mean, cmon, the whole premise is around $500,000 worth of heroin. Please. Even in today's dollars, that's a joke. The movie spends 10 minutes watching the cops rip the car apart trying to find where the drugs are stashed. Today, drug traffickers rent 26 foot Ryder trucks to move the stuff around. The vaunted chase scene was ok, but again, it's nothing special compared to what's done today.Essentially, almost the entire movie consists of watching a couple unlikeable cops tail bad guys for over an hour. Yawn."
29709,-1,Yawn,"This movie is almost as old as I am, and it shows. I just don't have an hour to invest in getting interested in a movie. I just about gave up at the hour mark, but pushed through it. This is just a snoozer of a film.The ending is just ridiculous, there's no tension, Roy's character barely speaks. If not for Hackman this movie wouldn't even be watchable."
29713,-1,just okay,The movie has the characters that you liked and scenes that are funny. But I didn't like the story. I am not a game player when it comes to relationships so I had lost interest.
29721,-1,"watch the trailer, don't bother with the movie",This movie was extremely disappointing. I don't know why it was marketed as a comedy. The only two funny parts of the movie were in the trailer. The rest of the movie was a dramatic softcore porn. Meryl Streep's performance was terrible. I couldn't believe it. She looked very uncomfortable in front of the camera.
29725,-1,A slight entertainment,"Somewhat weak romantic comedy, better at the romance than the comedy. The usually fabulous Meryl Streep's comedic acting seemed awkward to me in this although I thought Uma Thurman did a good job as did the male lead."
29726,-1,There's always Uma,"If I try to watch another Manhattan comedy romance flick, I shall poke my eyeballs out first in order to better appreciate it. Meryl, Uma, what are you thinking? Ah, Money of course. Who can blame you? Formula, formula, formula. The really big problem here was the numbskull leading man. Clearly a Mafioso insert ""actor"".Are we really expected to believe this stud dudoo is an artist? Who is loved by Uma? No acting required....just read the lines, raise the eyebrows in that sexy TV manner and be ""cool"". I'm not an airhead chick that this movie was manufactured to target, so it is easier for me to be objective//\\ a poop is a poop. My wife even thought it was terrible. What more can I say?Oh yes, really bad pop music score to boot."
29734,-1,Boring and Disappointing,"A famous quote in the book is, ""Fear is the mind-killer"". I agree if you fear reading boring books as alternative to treating insominia.There were some good parts of the book that sparked interest, but they were few and far in between.I read the marketing ploys trying to convince the LOR fans that Dune was their science fiction savior. It's pure nonsense.What I can't understand is how overrated this book was. Even English majors I know gave me positive accounts of this book."
29737,-1,way over rated,It really puzzles me how this book could have so many five stars. How a slow book like this could achieve a rating close to Ender's Game is indeed quite incomprehensible. Are there many fans from the 1960s editions rating it?
29744,-1,Disappointing,"I am an avid SF Fan who has long been about to read ""Dune"", and this summer I finally started. I really had high expectations, especially after reading all the raving reviews in this forum.Sadly, I found this book hard to get into, slow-paced and a little too confused to really catch my interest. I made it through just because I felt I had to, and was actually relieved when it finally ended and I could start reading the next book that I had in line waiting for me. Not recommended!"
29746,-1,Not worth the money,"While Dune was rich in historical and sociological vision (a pun), Dune Messiah is a poorly executed commercial sequel. Readers of Dune can explore age old conflicts based upon wealth, power, and religion. Herbert uses the planet Dune to retell the story of religious incarnation and to explore the conflict between religion and power without the baggage of historical and religious bias. While Dune Messiah promises to continue the brillant story telling of Dune, the characters become one dimensional. Instead of exploring religious conflict, Dune Messiah wastes the time of its readers in living Paul's drug induced hallucinations."
29751,-1,Not so great,"Like many other of the reviewers listed here, I decided to read this book based on the positive feedback I've received from friends and the many glowing reviews at Amazon.I managed to read about 100 pages before I realised that this book was boring and going nowhere very fast. Maybe I've been spoiled by author's such as George Martin & Dan Simmons who write truly captivating prose.Dune is one of those books that I may get back to one day (with emphasis on the ""may"")."
29759,-1,Dune,"Dune seem to have some really cool concepts yet, it was two slow in the beginning so I really never could get into it. the whole benne gesseritt theory was cool where jessica could change the water of life so it couldnt kill you.Thanks for readingSincerelyTyler"
29762,-1,it's decent,"I've had this phone since October. I got it because it was so small and adorable. At first I was happy with it...but once I actually started using it, that all changed. Good news first..PROS:-Loud volume-Easy to use-Lots of included ringtones..some are cute, some are a little out there-Voice recorderCONS:-CONSTANTLY drops calls-Recieves text messages HOURS after people send them-VERY small text messages--160 characters...most phones have over 800-The buttons make a very loud clicking noise sometimes so you have to shut off the phone for a few minutes-Bad battery life..if you send a few messages a day and talk on the phone for a few minutes, you're gonna have to charge it all night-You can't have real music tones-Voice recorder can't be your ringtone-Very bad speaker interference..I have to keep it a few feet away from the computer/tv and anything else with speakersI wish more people would have said bad things about this phone before I bought it! Stay away from this phone if possible.."
29776,-1,This book is a pastiche of other earlier books,"It is hardly definitve in that, for two things, it doesn't even mention Hank Harrison and plays down Pig Pen McKernan's role in forming the band. Not mentioning Harrison (or bad rapping him) is ironic since the book cover emphaiszes, in large print, the words THE DEAD, which is, not coincidentaly, the title of Harrison's trilogy, Trager can hardly be thought of as a literary artist. I give it 2 stars for reference only."
29778,-1,So where's the rest of it????,"I was intrigued by the now cancelled TV show and so decided to pick up the book that the show was based on so I could have some closure on the story. Unfortunately, the book is nothing more than a lead in to the show. The books ends about where the show picks up. Needless to say I am still in the dark about where the story goes and how it ends. Very frustrating. It was a decent book up to the abrupt and unsatisfying ending."
29787,-1,"Great political treatise, lousy literature","Bless him for keeping this one short, unlike his contemporaries in Russian literature. Unfortunately, the fact that this book is 200 pages is the best thing I can say about it. This is so clearly the case of an author who had a political statement to make and decided, unwisely, to couch it in a fictional as opposed to non-fictional format. This would have made for a great political or sociological treatise, but it is not good literature. The characters and plot are so obviously secondary to the message. The characters are one-dimensional, predictable, and transparent. The plot is forgettable and really almost seems to have been an afterthought. The only real merit of this book is that it captures the birth of an important social and political movement, at a very pivotal time in Russian history."
29788,-1,"okay, not great","Lighter weight than I expected, and the lids aren't ""precision fit"" as the packaging states. The handles are a bit loose. They've been okay for the soups, stews, eggs and sauteed veggies I've made. An okay product if you can't afford the good enamelware."
29790,-1,errors in appendix M,"I have not read this book, but I was given Appendix M as part of a list of suggested books for Summer Reading. As a librarian, I am appalled by the number of errors in this list of titles and authors. Students will have trouble finding several of these books when the authors' names and the titles are spelled incorrectly. How can we expect the best from students when we give them a sloppily edited list from which to choose their reading material? One example is ""Zusack, Markus. Fighting Reuben Wolf"", which should read ""Zusak, Markus. Fighting Ruben Wolfe."" Vivian Vande Velde's book is ""The Rumplestiltskin Problem"" not just ""The Rumplestiltskin."" This book is in desperate need of better editing before teachers use it to select books."
29791,-1,I couldn't believe it...,I've never really had shirts 'break apart' like these did. They looked ok for a couple of washes but afterwards they completely fell apart. Simply a bad product. Not worth the cheap price.
29793,-1,The author keeps you guessing,"Besides, taking awhile to get into the book. The book is also very wordy and gory. That was enough for me to give it two stars. The thing that I liked best about the story is that you never know what is going to happen next. The author keeps you guessing constantly."
29795,-1,tabloid?,"It is tremendously difficult to describe the life of such a world political giant in 50 minutes. Yet this video spend 10% of the time telling stories of Mao's affair with some anonymous girls while many much more important historical events and persons were not even mentioned. The writer counted correctly how many times he married, but failed to say anything about his children.In summary, this documentary tries to cover both his political life and personal life, but end up getting none."
29796,-1,Ridiculously biased,"This purports to be an objective examination of the principles of economics. Instead, it's a load of conservatively biased economics propaganda - without even a mention of opposing views. Dangerously influential, considering that it is used as a text for Introductory Economics at places like Harvard and University of Chicago."
29798,-1,Disappointing,"Another reviewer described Truman Capote's acting as unimpressive - decidedly a gross understatement. However, the main weakness of the film is the cornball cheap humor and lack of wit. The great cast is wasted throughout. It's worse than Mel Brooks ""History of the World"". Also, there are many convoluted attempts at twists and turns, but the results offer few surprises. In the end, it's more of a high-school script than a movie.The DVD extras are minimal and mostly unenlightening."
29803,-1,rent don't buy,I attempted to watch this film a few different times. I could just never quite get to the end. It's not because it's a particularly bad movie in fact it's just a modern day version of James Bond... its just that it never really excited me. The one redeeming factor is the car - it really becomes a character of its own.
29806,-1,XXX,"This movie is just like a James Bond wannabee, the cars the gadgets , are all copied from some James Bond movies. I am an avid fan of James Bond movies and I am not saying that I being a James Bond fan is bias in commenting this movie, but this movie and all its cast & characters still cannot hold a candle to all the James bond movies."
29807,-1,Very Cliche (2.5 Stars),"[I was very torn between giving this movie 2 or 3 stars, so I decided on a 2.5 rating] This movie isn't as great as it was hyped up to be. Right after seeing it, I thought it was really good! But then once all the excitement died down, I realized that this movie pretty much stunk. It was very predictable. I mean, you know that Vin Diesel's character is going to save the world, and that he's going to get the girl. James Bond has nothing to worry about, since any of the Bond movies are better than this flick. It's worth a peak, but it's not a movie I would go out and buy. Sure it has a lot of action, but just action doesn't make a movie. The plot is unoriginal and not that exciting. I think I kind of forced myself to like this because the kids I saw it with thought it was ""so tight"" but actually it's not. So, if you're looking for a cheesy action movie, you've found it here! Not that highly recommended. ... Enjoy... well, maybe not..."
29808,-1,Action over Dialogue Anyone?,"Okay, for some, this will be a great movie. I remember, as a teen, watching Stallone and enjoying many a movie where it was all about action and not about plot, character or acting. For the next generation, here is Vin Diesel. He is not James Bond, but maybe James Bond's younger, American second cousin. Sure, he used some spy stuff, but for the most part, XXX uses ESPN Extreme Sports moves to make his plans work out okay.For the rest of us, this movie is not a good option. It actually got a little boring watching scene after scene staged just to show off another ""stunt."" Perhaps if the pyrotechnics budget had been diminished just a tad and reinvested in a decent screenwriter and acting coach, this could have been a boxoffice blockbusting series in the making. Unfortunately, it is not."
29815,-1,XXX - Review on the actual Blu-Ray,"First off, I like the film. But... the blu-ray is disappointing. The clarity is not what I expected and no better than the DVD. In a word, grainy. So, if you got the film on DVD, just keep than and enjoy a fun action film. The blu-ray has no further special features or anything else special."
29822,-1,Tedious,There's no doubt this novel has a good story line. The main problem I had was getting to it. I labored through so much descriptive prose that I often forgot where I was in the story. It was a chore to finish and I have come to the conclusion I should not read any more Pulitzer Prize winning novelists. This is my fourth and none have been half as good as a Glass Castle or Memoirs of a Geisha or many others with less acclaim.
29827,-1,all the kings men,It was so busy of a book I felt I had to read it super fast and didn't have time for it to soak into my mind. was not happy with it.
29834,-1,a walking Formula,"when I think of the Rolling Stones all I think is a walking Billboard of Logo much else.same Riffs that have been going on for almost 30 years.so-so Lyrics&the vocals have continued to go down hill.The Rolling stones have been so Robitic over the years it ain';t even funny. they Basically found a formula&stuck to it. these days as has been the case for a good 20 plus years they do better concerts than they make decent Albums,even if alot of there Tours are pretty much a set format as well."
29836,-1,Not up to Standard,"I found myself to very disappointed with this CD as it was just not up to the usual standards of this band. I found all the cuts to sound similiar and I missed the ""bluesy-ness"" we have come to expect from this once great band."
29839,-1,"Oh, Pleeeze","The lyrics on Biggerbang are so bad! If you have a brain, you will cringe. ""...i'm just one of your cocks"": How old are you guys!? Musically it's pretty rockin and tight. I wish you could turn down Jagger, not because of his singing which is really good but because the lyrics seem like they were written by a fourteen year old with a big ego."
29843,-1,Boring!!,"This movie is an utterly tedious treatment of a very interesting topic. Everything in it is stale and trite, and it plods along from incident to incident, without any drama at all. It's a rare movie with good production values and fine actors that I cannot sit through, but I pushed the OFF button on this one after an hour or so."
29858,-1,Not a family bible story,"Great music, great story, mostly wonderful presentation, but there is a surprising amount of slutty wardrobes. Shirtless Donny isn't an issue to me an my family. It is the highly provocative costumes of many females (Potiphar’s wife and dancers around Pharaoh quickly come to mind) makes this inappropriate for families. Surprisingly provocative for a bible story retelling. Inappropriately so."
29862,-1,Poor sound weakens a great show,"After seeing the stage production, I had great hopes for this DVD and was eagerly looking forward to Dolby Digital 5.1. It turns out that the 5.1 encoding is so poor that the only way to listen to it is analog Dolby Pro Logic. In chapter four for example, the brothers and narrator are center stage but only the narrator's voice comes out through the center channel - the brothers are ""lost"" in the left and right channels. This is not the case with analog decoding. Also, 5.1 levels are a good 10-15 db below where they should be and 10 db below the analog. This is the poorest 5.1 mix I have ever seen.This was so bad that I sent the first DVD back and Amazon graciously exchanged it for another. The second was just as bad.If you have a Dolby Digital, don't bother, unless you want to use the analog channel."
29868,-1,What was that!,"I was excited about this movie coming out... I had read all the updates on the reallyuseful web site which is the official page and when it came on tv I was really happy... notice the word WAS really happy. The movie started out ok, interesting school asembly concept, then it went WHOOP down hill! The narrator didn't do justice to her role and the children cheering were unbeleiveably annoying. It seemed more like a music video than anything else. I was also dissappointed by the brothers who were a bit too gay to my liking. I was expecting somewhat straighter brothers, no offense to anyone who is gay but it was not what I had in mind. The movie did have some good parts though like Donny's ""Close Every Door To Me"" but then a very unentertaining Pharoah brought it down again w/ his terrible impression backed up with not what I would call the 'best' choreography. I love this show but I just cant find anything... ""amazing"" about this video."
29875,-1,Stupidly funny.,"Sorority Boys is the dumbest, pointless, and offensive film of 2002. With that being said, this film does have some funny jokes and thanks to Michael Rosenbaum, he keeps this sex comedy from sinking fast. Rosenbaum has great comic timing which isn't always apparent since he plays Lex Luthor on Smallville, he gets to show his funny bone and he is a hoot! Barry Watson is quite pretty as a girl but this film is no Animal House. This film is a guilty pleasure, so it keep it a secret. Good luck!"
29876,-1,LAME.,Lame! Lame! Lame! Corny sexual humour. No wonder it tanked- if the Amazon.com thing is true. Because it's bad. Don't watch it unless you think e*ections are one of the funniest things in the whole entire world.
29880,-1,Simplistic description - poorly written,"The method itself is extremely interesting, unfortunately the authors repeat the same examples over and over again. Very annoying. The style borders on boring. I would recommend definitely reading the book from Savransky as a much better example of TRIZ"
29886,-1,not scary at all,"some people are saying this is the best horror movie of all time.im just like ""what? ""this movie was not scary,it was funny! for the whole last half hour all it was,was this bigbreasted girl going ""ahhhhh! god,no! help me! ahhhhhhhh! ""and the guy with the chainsaw going ""argharhgarhgarhgarhgarhg! ""and yelling like a retard.it cracked me up.then at the end it was just about these crazy people beating up that girl for no reason.and that chainsaw was lasting forever.it would have run out of power after going that long!"
29890,-1,No Way Near The Best,"This movie for its time was a very scary movie. I know the whole true story thing made it good ,but the movie itself was a huge dissapointment i rented them all when i heard they were remakeing the first one. i enjoyed that one. from one horror fan to another this movie is a waste of time"
29902,-1,Glad I didn't pay money to watch this film,"I borrowed it from the library so watching it didn't cost me any money. The video cover is scarier than the movie.This film dragged...poor plot...and worse acting. Thank God, for the pause button because it would have been difficult to sit though this whole movie without a break. I did enjoy the mother decking the smirk off the nurse's face after the mother protested them giving her son a sedative. It's too bad it wasn't one of those nasty nurses who died instead of the nice babysitter."
29904,-1,Fiction and reality blurred,"The movie was not the best effort by Robert Englund or Wes Craven. They did a good job at blurring fiction and reality, but all in all a disappointment. As I watched this movie I thought to myself, why is Wes Craven so famous for? Sure he's made two classic movies- Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream but thats about all. I love Wishmaster, but im sure people dont even remember it. Last House on the Left was bad or at least I thought so. The last three or four movies he's done has been flops. So why is Wes Craven so popular? He really hasnt done much. Come on, I know there is a reviewer out there dying to answer this."
29911,-1,"good idea, bad script","Wes Craven decided to make a Nightmare on Elm Street movie by mixing reality with fantasy. This was a good idea but the movie itself just wasn't good. The fist half of New Nightmare is slow and drawn out while the second half barely picks up and leaves a mediocre ending. If you are curious to see this film then go ahead and rent it. Still, I think the chances of New Nightmare being dissapointing are very high."
29914,-1,Here we go again. So much for 'Freddy's Dead',"What could have been an interesting insight into the effects of films and the Freddy myth in general is no more than an excuse to drag out a now tired character yet again. There are good moments, but also a lot of padding, and you can't help but feel all the way through this film that Freddy should have been laid to rest a long time ago."
29923,-1,Please,"Just not a very good album. Rather than creating new music that lives and breathes (like the Squirrel Nut Zippers), CPD just photocopy a style they like."
29932,-1,Rather weak,"This is an unfortunate example of pop music. The artist, Hoku, has very weak vocals and is made to sound better by stronger back-up vocalists. It's all well and good for younger kids, but this artist does not have the staying power that some of the other recent acts have shown."
29940,-1,Tatu Stinks!,Tatu will never appear on the cover's of the pop magazines like Justin Timberlake and Avril lavigne did when they succeeded on their first albums.Tatu are just obnoxious with their songs and music.The lyrics to the songs are constantly repeated and they look like their everywhere when you look at them by analyzing. Those background laughs in ''30 minutes'' are annoying and know this none of Tatu's videos appeared on muchmore music but Avril lavigne's did.It's easy to explain how come ''not gonna get us now'' didn't make it on the countdown which pop videos usually do because it wasn't popular and not very good. It looks embarassing when the British banned a Tatu video and not letting Julia into a Mcdonalds.It just looks so phony that these girls are homosexual and they probably aren't...they probably do what their manager told them what to do. Tatu are shams and you should feel ashamed by wasting your money on this disgraceful exploitation of a Europop album.
29944,-1,Lack of vocal ability,"While this CD may be good for dancing purposes, it has no depth in terms of lyrics and the vocals are very weak artistically to call the two girls who pretend to lead a gay lifestyle for publicity purposes singers."
29946,-1,The CD is ok,"t.a.t.u is in fact the biggerst gimmick of all the time. (what there name stands for............the kissing.........the taking off of clothes.............and so on and so forth. This album is ok if you take it for what it is: a gimmicky duo of russian females who can't sing and have no real talent but have just enough voice so it can be doctored up with pro tools and placed of pop-like dance beats. If you take the album for what it is its ok but it is in no way new, different, rock or alterative and is not ""the best album ever"" like some reviewers have posted."
29948,-1,average,"i really liked the song ""all the things she said"" but the rest of the album is mostly average stuff, the album would need a few more number 1 hits songs to be classified as grammy award material,this album doesn't have the capability. I wouldn't recommend buying this album unless your a fan of tatu, otherwise get the single of ""all the things she said"" instead."
29953,-1,Didn't fit,"The box was torn up when it arrived. It looked like it had been opened and then sent back. The""U"" bolts would'nt even go around the differental. and the instructions are useless."
29957,-1,Beware Krappy video-ness,"The story is a classic one and is protrayed pretty well story wise. The problem is that the characters are freakishly non-human looking (not that kids would mind, i liked it then). Also, this movie was made in the 1970's and they haven't made any effort to fix up the old film, so it looks like a bootleg; seriously! JUST BEWARE QUALITY."
29958,-1,over-whelmed with a sense of its own importance,"seeing this film successfully kept me from reading anything by tolkien for over ten years. after i had read ""the hobbit,"" i was able to watch it and laugh more often than i felt appaled.the film lacks the quiet dignity of the book and feels heavy-handed. watching it i could only think of the phrase, ""bilbo gump."" the progress the character of bilbo makes in the book is lost in film and we are left with a hero who wanders through his various adventures, which apparently have very little effect on anything aside from his financial situation. and as an extra side-note, the music feels ridiculous."
29969,-1,Unwatchable,"That's more or less what this is. The picture was so bad my eyes were straining to see it, especially during the dark parts, which take up a huge chunk of the movie. No matter what picture adjustments I tried, nothing helped. Also there were places that were overlayed and there were even small pieces of scenes that were missing. The characters would be in the middle of speaking and suddenly it would jump forward a few seconds, and I know for a feact it wasn't the disc just skipping. Sad to say, I'm planning on returning this item."
29970,-1,There really needs to be a better DVD transfer than this one,"I'm a huge fan of this old Rankin Bass production. It takes a lot of shortcuts from the book and has a very different tone in places, but the designs are good and I even have a lot of fondness for the music, goofy as it can be.However, this DVD transfer is really poor. As others have said, it looks like it was just straight-up copied over from a rough VHS. There are skips and repeats, artifacts everywhere so that it looks like the lowest-res YouTube imaginable, and overall is too dark. It feels like you're watching a bootleg. I'm not entirely convinced it's a legitimate production, honestly, it's so sketchy."
29973,-1,Always liked this movie but poor video quality,I gave this item 2 stars because I do enjoy this movie. Unfortunately the quality of this video left a great deal to be desired. The picture quality was faded like it was made from an old original. It was also difficult to see in the darker scenes. There were points where the movie skipped a little or actually repeated a segment (1-2 seconds). I also noticed that there were times when the original sound effects were missing. Just a poor quality video.
29980,-1,wide margin-double column?,"I recently recieved my wide margins edition of the ESV. Unfortunatley, it has double columns which makes it impossible to take effective notes on the inside column, which is the only reason people buy wide margin versions in the first place.Otherwise, it is a good bible, good translation. I like the cover and will would preaching from it if it was single column."
29987,-1,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this item, but it just didn't measure up. It does not stay in place, and it feels like you are walking with a foreign object under the ball of your foot."
29988,-1,no menu,"The main thing I bought this for is to control my Ipod. Which you can do but no menu on the tv to control it. It is very hard to see an ipod 10' away. Also there is a high pitch sound when you change songs, that lasts for a second or two. I have everything hooked up correctly and settings set."
29989,-1,toy,"this camera is so behind its unbelievable..bad pictures, not enough featuresi gave mine to my 4yr old neice"

IT purchased one of these at work because they couldn't wait on the M2 MacBook Air, but now they wish they had.I have been using this device for a few weeks now and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. I have been a huge fan of Apple Silicon architecture since its release, and I originally purchased the 13\" MBP with the M1 chip in it before upgrading to the 16\" M1 Max that I use now. Apple Silicon is a game changer and really sets the standard for creative workloads.My issue at this point is what exactly this M2 version of the 13\" MBP brings to the table. The 2022 MacBook Pro with the M2 chip utilizes the older chassis from the previous gen. As such, your port options are limited and you do not get MagSafe charging. The chassis also is starting to look a bit dated with Apple shifting towards cleaner and flatter lines on their devices.The 2022 MacBook Air has everything you need in a device around this price point. With the 2022 MacBook Air, you will get MagSafe charging, you will get a larger 13.6\" screen with smaller bevels (vs. 13.3\" on MBP), you will get 1080p camera (720p on MBP), you will get lighter weight at 2.7lbs (3lbs on MBP), and you will get Apple's newer chassis.The MBP does include a fan for active cooling, as well as the touchbar. If you're purchasing the Apple MacBook Pro 13\" for tasks that require active cooling as a necessity, you will likely need a minimum of 16gb of RAM, at which point your best bet is to spend the extra $200 and upgrade to the 14\" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip. I have never met anyone who just really likes the touch bar to the point that it's a game changer, but if you really need that touch bar, this is the only way you can get it now.The M2 MacBook Pro also provides 2hrs of better battery life than the MacBook Air, but this is not worth sacrificing all of the other benefits of the Air.Overall, if you purchase this device, it will perform well and do everything you really need. It is a good computer and you will be happy with it. At the same time, there are BETTER purchase options on either end of the spectrum, creating sort of a niche market of consumers for which the 13\" MBP is desired. My recommendation is to either purchase the 2022 MacBook Air, or go ahead and step up to the 14\" MacBook Pro M1."}, {"LAPTOP_DESIGN_FEATURES": 3, "LAPTOP_GENERAL": 3, "review": "Fantastic machine.
